   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -         iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -         follow hct daily.
   -         Maintain Type and screen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure evaluation. She has been experiencing fever, respiratory distress, and tachycardia. Her medical history includes a recent URI/bronchitis and a history of pneumonia. She is currently on hemodialysis and has a dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of ESRD, limited mobility, and subtherapeutic anticoagulation put her at high risk for DVT and PE. A CT chest did not show any PE, but small bilateral pleural effusions were noted.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and poor rate control of her AFib. She requires mechanical ventilation and is at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's fever is likely due to pneumonia, but other causes such as C. difficile colitis, PE, or cellulitis need to be ruled out.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly rate-controlled, and her INR is supra-therapeutic. She requires increased metoprolol dosing and repeat INR monitoring.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely due to her ESRD and needs to be closely monitored.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her ESRD and phlebotomy. Further workup, including iron panel, B12, and folate, is needed to evaluate her anemia.
7. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is likely due to her leg wounds and needs to be treated with antibiotics.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and her creatinine levels need to be closely monitored.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed.
2. Order bronchoscopy to further workup tracheobronchomalacia.
3. Evaluate for pneumonia with CXR, sputum gram stain and culture.
4. Check blood and urine cultures, UA, and stool C. difficile toxin assay.
5. Consider empiric flagyl for C. difficile colitis.
6. Continue metoprolol and adjust dosing as needed.
7. Monitor INR and adjust warfarin therapy as needed.
8. Evaluate anemia with iron panel, B12, and folate.
9. Treat cellulitis with antibiotics.
10. Continue hemodialysis and monitor creatinine levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -         iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -         follow hct daily.
   -         Maintain Type and screen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA. She was transferred to the ICU for IP evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, dialysis catheter, and receiving antibiotics. She has a fever of 101.2°F, and her respiratory status is unstable. The patient's EKG shows atrial fibrillation, and her labs indicate anemia, renal failure, and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is on invasive ventilation. Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload are possible causes of her respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The patient's fever is unknown in origin, and she is at risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis are also possible causes of her fever.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of RV dysfunction and is at risk of DVT and PE due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and she requires HD. Her electrolyte imbalance and anemia may be related to her kidney disease.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and she is at risk of developing cardiac complications.
6. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is receiving antihypertensive medication.
7. Leg wounds: The patient has leg wounds that require wound care and may be at risk of infection.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her kidney disease and phlebotomy.
9. Anxiety: The patient is anxious and requires psychological support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Investigate the cause of her fever and treat accordingly.
3. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her HD schedule as needed.
5. Control the patient's atrial fibrillation and monitor her cardiac status.
6. Manage the patient's HTN and leg wounds.
7. Evaluate the patient's anemia and consider further workup.
8. Provide psychological support to the patient and her family."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes
   - ASA 325 daily
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR therapeutic currently, continue warfarin
   - Will review CT chest with radiology here
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN
   Continue metoprolol
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   Will consult wound care for local care recommendations
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate, guiac stools and follow hct
   daily. Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has developed a fever, and her respiratory status is unstable, with increased shortness of breath and tachypnea. Her cardiac rhythm is irregular, and she has a history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation, which puts her at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for further deterioration, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: Given her history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation and limited mobility, the patient is at high risk for developing a pulmonary embolism, which could be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly.
3. Fever: The patient's fever could be due to a variety of causes, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis, and requires further evaluation and treatment.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly controlled, and she is at risk for developing further complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
5. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and she is at risk for further complications, such as uremic acidosis or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Cellulitis: The patient's leg wounds are at risk for developing cellulitis, which could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or amputation.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her ESRD and phlebotomy, and requires further evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications.
8. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is likely related to her underlying medical conditions and requires further evaluation and treatment to manage her symptoms.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to manage her multiple medical complications and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure due to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and urinary tract infection (URI)/bronchitis.
* Fever: The patient's temperature is currently normal, but she has had mildly elevated temperatures overnight. C. difficile (C. diff) culture is negative, and antibiotics will be held pending further evaluation.
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) scan is pending, and the attending physician will evaluate it for evidence of PE. If PE is suspected, the patient will require heparin drip therapy.
* ESRD on HD: The patient receives hemodialysis three times a week and will receive it tomorrow.
* Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient's AFib is currently poorly controlled, and her metoprolol dose will be increased to 50 mg three times a day.
* HTN: The patient received 5 mg IV metoprolol twice for tachycardia and 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia has recurred, and the patient will continue metoprolol with possible more frequent dosing if needed.
* Leg wounds: The patient has well-healing wounds on her legs, and wound care recommendations will be followed.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency and anemia, which may be related to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Further evaluation is pending.
* Anxiety: The patient's anxiety will be managed with zoloft and ativan as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing respiratory distress, pneumonia, or other underlying conditions.
2. Pulmonary embolism: If the patient is diagnosed with PE, it may lead to severe respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, or death.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient's C. diff culture is negative, but if she develops a C. diff infection, it may lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and underlying conditions make her susceptible to infections, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and underlying heart disease increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac arrest.
7. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical complications. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure, fever, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central line, dialysis catheter, and tracheobronchomalacia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her chronic tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and atrial fibrillation. She may require continued mechanical ventilation and further evaluation with bronchoscopy to rule out other causes of her respiratory failure.
2. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to her recent broad-spectrum antibiotics and may be secondary to Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis. She may require further evaluation with blood and urine cultures, as well as treatment with empiric flagyl.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's risk of PE is high due to her history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and her limited mobility. She may require further evaluation with a CT scan of the chest to rule out PE.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD is likely to worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications. She may require further evaluation with a nephrologist to determine the best course of treatment.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely to worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications. She may require further evaluation with a cardiologist to determine the best course of treatment.
6. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is likely due to her impaired skin integrity and may require further evaluation with a wound care specialist.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications. She may require further evaluation with a nephrologist to determine the best course of treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Further evaluate the patient's fever with blood and urine cultures, as well as treatment with empiric flagyl.
3. Evaluate the patient's risk of PE with a CT scan of the chest.
4. Continue to manage the patient's ESRD with hemodialysis and further evaluation with a nephrologist.
5. Further evaluate the patient's atrial fibrillation with a cardiologist and determine the best course of treatment.
6. Manage the patient's cellulitis with wound care and further evaluation with a wound care specialist.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's renal failure and further evaluate with a nephrologist to determine the best course of treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis. Tracheobronchomalacia may have contributed to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may be related to pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, or other causes. She is at risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis due to loose stools and recent broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, which may be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time, but has a history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation and limited mobility, putting her at risk for DVT and PE.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient receives hemodialysis and will require ongoing management while in the ICU.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly controlled on metoprolol, and her INR is supra-therapeutic. She will require increased dosing of warfarin and close monitoring of her INR.
6. HTN: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol.
7. Leg wounds: The patient has leg wounds, which will require ongoing wound care and management.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. She will require further evaluation and management.
9. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which will be managed with zoloft and ativan as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent C. difficile colitis
2. Pneumonia
3. Pulmonary embolism
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression
6. Anemia worsening
7. Respiratory failure exacerbation
8. Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation)
9. Wound complications (e.g., cellulitis, infection)

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Tube feeds will continue, with NPO status after midnight Sunday.
2. Glycemic control: The patient will require close monitoring of her glucose levels and management of hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient will have a multi-lumen line and a dialysis catheter.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will require DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.
5. Code status: The patient's code status is full code.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely mulHistory suggestive of a
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely mulHistory suggestive of a
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation and management.

The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, with increased oxygen requirements and tachypnea. Her pulmonary reserve is limited due to morbid obesity and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly rate-controlled, and she has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient has also developed fever, with a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), and has loose stools, which may be related to Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of recurrent C. difficile colitis.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, with open wounds on her legs, and is at risk for further complications, including cellulitis and sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, indicating renal impairment. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, but her troponin-T level is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury.

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, AF, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA. She has a history of C. difficile colitis, PE, and DVT.

The patient's medications include warfarin, metoprolol, ASA, and lorazepam. She is also receiving tube feeds and has a central line and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited, and she may require further respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a pulmonary infection.
3. Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis: The patient's loose stools and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a C. difficile infection.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of PE and DVT, combined with her atrial fibrillation and limited mobility, puts her at risk for further PE.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and limited mobility puts her at risk for further DVT.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and history of atrial fibrillation may indicate cardiac injury or further cardiac complications.
7. Sepsis: The patient's impaired skin integrity and open wounds on her legs put her at risk for further sepsis.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or further complications.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical problems, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. She is at risk for further complications, including pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, PE, DVT, cardiac complications, sepsis, and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD and
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.

   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD and
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, fever, and hypoxia, and is at risk for recurrent C. difficile colitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, and URI/bronchitis. Tracheobronchomalacia may also have contributed to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient is at risk for recurrent C. difficile colitis, pneumonia, and PE. Pneumonia is a consideration, and the patient's recent broad-spectrum antibiotics may have contributed to the development of C. difficile colitis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, which may be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time, but is at risk for DVT and PE due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
4. ESRD on Hemodialysis: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and she is at risk for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF is poorly controlled, and her INR is supra-therapeutic. She is at risk for bleeding and stroke.
6. HTN: The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and she is at risk for cardiac complications.
7. Leg Wounds: The patient has leg wounds that require ongoing wound care and management.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to her ESRD and phlebotomy. She is at risk for acute inflammatory change and suppression of chronic disease.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is being managed with zoloft and ativan as needed.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds and will be NPO after midnight Sunday.
* Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored and managed.
* Lines: The patient has multiple lines, including a dialysis catheter and a multi-lumen line.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Comments: The patient's communication and code status are full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is complicated by obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic heart failure, and volume overload from ESRD.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient has a 50% chance of having a small right lower segment PE, according to radiology reports. This requires close monitoring and further evaluation.
2. **Tracheobronchomalacia:** Although the patient's IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, the presence of tracheobronchomalacia may have contributed to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. This could lead to further respiratory complications.
3. **Fever:** The patient has had mildly elevated temperatures overnight, and C. diff is negative. Discontinuing flagyl and holding all antibiotics for now may lead to further evaluation and management of the fever.
4. **Anemia:** The patient has a history of iron deficiency and is currently anemic. Further evaluation and management of anemia are necessary, including reticulocyte count and smear, and consideration of ferritin levels.
5. **Atrial Fibrillation (AF):** The patient's AF is currently poorly controlled, and Coumadin has been restarted. Close monitoring of INR and daily follow-up are necessary.
6. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, but further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent hypertension-related complications.
7. **Leg Wounds:** The patient has well-healing wounds on her medial upper thighs, and further wound care recommendations are necessary.
8. **Renal Failure:** The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management, including HD three times a week, and close monitoring of renal function.
9. **Impaired Skin Integrity:** The patient has impaired skin integrity, which requires further evaluation and management to prevent further complications.
10. **Cellulitis:** The patient has a history of cellulitis, which requires further evaluation and management to prevent further complications.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical status requires close monitoring and ongoing management to prevent further complications. The potential medical complications identified above require further evaluation and management to ensure the patient's optimal care."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a [age] year-old patient admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease, and fever of unknown origin. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and troponin levels, indicating an inflammatory response and potential cardiac injury. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, cellulitis, and respiratory failure. The patient has a PICC line and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's chronic respiratory failure and intubation, the risk of developing pneumonia is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels suggest an inflammatory response, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin levels indicate potential cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and end-stage renal disease diagnosis suggest that the patient is at risk for further renal failure.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity and cellulitis diagnosis suggest that the patient is at risk for further skin breakdown and potential infection.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA, was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of possible tracheobronchomalacia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's 24-hour events include a radiology report suggesting a 50% chance of a small right lower segment PE, but the study was poor. Coumadin was restarted, and HD is scheduled for tomorrow. The patient will be extubated tomorrow following HD. The patient's facial rash was treated with triamcinolone cream, and her PICC line needs to be readjusted by IR tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 50%. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a VT of 550 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals an obese woman with a well-healed trach scar at the base of her neck, rhonchi bilaterally, and no wheezing. Her abdomen is obese with nontender bowel sounds, and her extremities show 2+ edema bilaterally.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC of 12.1 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 0.23 ng/mL, and her CK/CKMB levels are 38/0.23 U/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: likely multifactorial, with tracheobronchomalacia as a possible contributing factor.
2. Fever: currently afebrile, with a mildly elevated temperature overnight. C. diff negative, and antibiotics will be held pending further evaluation.
3.?Pulmonary embolism: the patient's radiology report suggests a 50% chance of a small right lower segment PE, and the attending physician will review the OSH Chest CT to evaluate for PE.
4. ESRD on HD: the patient receives HD three times a week and will receive HD tomorrow.
5. Atrial fibrillation: the patient's rate is poorly controlled on metoprolol, and the dose will be increased to 50 TID. Coumadin was restarted today.
6. HTN: the patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and metoprolol will be continued, with possible more frequent dosing.
7. Leg wounds: the patient has a history of Fe deficiency and anemia, and further evaluation is needed.
8. Anxiety: the patient will be restarted on zoloft and ativan as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: the patient's radiology report suggests a 50% chance of a small right lower segment PE, and further evaluation is needed.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further evaluation and treatment are needed.
3. Anemia: the patient's anemia is likely related to ESRD and phlebotomy, and further evaluation is needed.
4. Fever: the patient's fever is currently afebrile, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Atrial fibrillation: the patient's rate is poorly controlled, and further treatment is needed to control her arrhythmia.
6. HTN: the patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and further treatment is needed to control her hypertension.
7. Leg wounds: the patient's leg wounds are a potential source of infection and further evaluation is needed.
8. Anxiety: the patient's anxiety is a potential source of distress and further treatment is needed to manage her anxiety."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute
   phase reactant.  Of note B12 also high
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute
   phase reactant.  Of note B12 also high
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to morbid obesity, and tracheobronchomalacia may have contributed to difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin, which may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism. A chest CT is ordered to evaluate for PE.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and they require regular hemodialysis three times a week.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and metoprolol is increased to 50 TID to control the rate.
5. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and metoprolol is continued to manage hypertension.
6. Leg wounds: The patient has wounds on their legs that require wound care and follow-up.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy, and their reticulocyte count is low.
8. Fever: The patient has a history of fever, and cultures are pending. Antibiotics are held pending further evaluation.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be related to their medical conditions or the use of central lines and dialysis catheters.
10. Cellulitis: The patient has a history of cellulitis, which may be related to their impaired skin integrity.

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plan are complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA. She was transferred to the ICU for IP evaluation for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis. She has been extubated and is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a history of fever, unknown origin, and has been diagnosed with cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions, such as OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, unknown origin, and cellulitis increase her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's morbid obesity and immobility increase her risk of developing DVT.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of DVT and PE, as well as her underlying conditions, increase her risk of developing PE.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen or develop into more severe arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation.
6. Renal failure: The patient's underlying ESRD and potential volume overload may worsen her renal function.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her underlying ESRD and potential bleeding complications.
8. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as wound infections or pressure ulcers.
9. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions and hospitalization.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen due to her underlying conditions and potential gastrointestinal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and cellulitis, and consider antibiotics if the infection does not improve.
3. Consider prophylaxis for DVT and PE, and monitor the patient's risk factors for these complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including her atrial fibrillation and potential arrhythmias.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust dialysis as needed.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's anemia treatment plan, including transfusions or erythropoietin therapy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and adjust wound care as needed.
8. Consider referring the patient to a mental health professional for anxiety and depression management.
9. Consider adjusting the patient's nutrition plan, including enteral or parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - Formal bronchoscopy tomorrow in suite by IP to determine if
   subglottic stenosis is present and to determine degree of external
   compression by goiter .
   - Follow cultures, hold abx as no sign of infection currently.
   - Volume removal with HD today
   - Very small chance she has a PE after discussion with attending
   radiologist, continue coumadin for A fib
   - Holding albuterol given tachycardia, restarting ipratropium
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today for more volume removal
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol,
   increased to 75 TID with better control.
   - Restarted coumadin
   - Follow daily INR, currently 1.4 but does not require heparin bridge
   .
   #. HTN:  Better controlled now.
   -Continue metoprolol only at increased dose
   .
   #. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.
   - guiac stools and
   - follow hct daily.
   - Maintain type and screen.
   .
   #. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination reveals an obese woman with an irregular tachycardia, no murmurs appreciated, and distant breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, likely secondary to ESRD, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Her creatinine level is 4.4 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.23 ng/mL.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: Formal bronchoscopy tomorrow to determine if subglottic stenosis is present and to determine the degree of external compression by goiter.
2. ESRD on HD: Gets HD MWF as an outpatient, and will get HD today for more volume removal.
3. Atrial fibrillation: Restarted coumadin, and follow daily INR, currently 1.4, but does not require heparin bridge.
4. HTN: Continue metoprolol only at increased dose.
5. Leg wounds: Follow wound care recommendations.
6. Anemia: Guaiac stools and follow HCT daily, and maintain type and screen.
7. Anxiety: Confirm home zoloft, and restart along with ativan as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and further management is needed to optimize her respiratory support.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory failure make her prone to infection. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and her anemia make her at risk for bleeding. Close monitoring of her bleeding risk is necessary.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and her use of anticoagulant therapy make her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm is necessary.
5. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and her anemia make her at risk for further renal failure. Close monitoring of her renal function is necessary.
6. Skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity and her risk of bleeding make her at risk for skin breakdown and bleeding. Close monitoring of her skin integrity is necessary.
7. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety and her use of sedatives make her at risk for anxiety-related complications. Close monitoring of her anxiety and her sedative use is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU patient who had a PICC line replacement and invasive ventilation stopped. They were extubated and had a normal temperature. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin levels. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, chronic fever, unknown origin, cellulitis, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could worsen their condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen or lead to other cardiac complications if not managed.
4. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
5. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as infection or tissue necrosis.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may drop further, leading to hypotension, if not managed properly.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
8. Nutritional issues: The patient's nutrition plan may need to be adjusted to ensure adequate caloric intake and prevent malnutrition.
9. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's history of coughing during eating may indicate gastrointestinal issues, such as aspiration or gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. Psychological issues: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  The patient
   will go to the OR tomorrow for correction of the stenosis.
   - FFP and desmopressin to the OR tomorrow.
   - Hold coumadin tonight, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD, due [**Hospital1 511**].
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - dexamethasone for inflammation
   - Heli-Ox for stridor overnight
   - If requires intubation, will need very small tube.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, due [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require UF tomorrow
   after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Hold coumadin given to OR tomorrow
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN regular renal diet, replete lytes PRN
   Access PICC placed
   PPX heparin SC TID, contact precautions for now for ? MRSA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, multinodular goiter, and OSA.
* She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial, and is scheduled for tracheobronchomalacia correction surgery tomorrow.
* The patient's current vital signs are:
	+ Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
	+ Heart rate: 103 bpm (92-121 bpm)
	+ Blood pressure: 120/78 mmHg (87-143/102 mmHg)
	+ Respiratory rate: 19 breaths/min (14-22 breaths/min)
	+ SpO2: 100%
* The patient has a large neck, which makes it difficult to assess the jugular venous pressure (JVP). She has a well-healed tracheostomy scar at the base of her neck and a goiter.
* The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral rhonchi in the lungs, no wheezing, and a regular tachycardic rhythm.
* Laboratory results show:
	+ White blood cell count: 6.1-12.1 K/μL
	+ Hemoglobin: 33.0-38.9 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 35-380 K/μL
	+ Creatinine: 3.3-5.1 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 0.22-0.23 ng/mL
	+ Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL
	+ Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
	+ Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL
* The patient has a history of respiratory failure, ESRD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, and is currently being treated for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the tracheobronchomalacia is not corrected, or if there is an underlying respiratory infection.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to her ESRD, which may increase her risk of developing an infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase her risk of bleeding during surgery or with invasive procedures.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen if she does not receive adequate dialysis or if there is an underlying renal injury.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly controlled, which may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or stroke.
6. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to her morbid obesity, which may increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers or skin infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  The patient
   will go to the OR tomorrow for correction of the stenosis.
   - FFP x3 and desmopressin to the OR today
   - Held coumadin, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD today.
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - CPAP overnight as needed
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, will have today, may require UF
   tomorrow after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol, however as patient responded so well to
   diltiazem yesterday, may consider switching to PO diltiazem via a dilt
   drip if goes into RVR again.
   - Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial in origin, and has undergone formal bronchoscopy, which showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. She will undergo correction of the stenosis in the operating room (OR) tomorrow.

The patient has been treated with CPAP overnight, and her oxygen saturation has remained at 100%. She has also been receiving diltiazem for tachycardia, which has responded well. The patient's blood pressure has been controlled with metoprolol, and her heart rhythm has been monitored.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, likely secondary to ESRD, and her stool has not been guaiac positive. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, and her platelet count is slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue until the tracheal stenosis is corrected, and she may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not properly managed, and she may be at risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's wounds are at risk for infection, and she may develop cellulitis or sepsis if not properly managed.
4. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease may worsen if not properly managed, and she may require dialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, and she may require blood transfusions.
6. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever may worsen if not properly managed, and she may develop hyperthermia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's wounds and adjust her therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's end-stage renal disease and adjust her therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's anemia and adjust her therapy as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust her therapy as necessary.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient will continue to receive NPO for now.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and adjusted as necessary.
3. Lines: The patient will continue to have a PICC line in place.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will continue to receive heparin SC TID for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. VAP: The patient will continue to be monitored for VAP and adjusted as necessary.
6. Comments: The patient's communication will continue to be monitored, and her code status will remain full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall individual with atrial fibrillation, currently in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, which was changed to diltiazem, and has been receiving infusions of antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 109 bpm (71-125 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/76 mmHg (86-125/94 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (15-24 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 99%
* Height: 66 inches

The patient has a history of bronchial stenosis, which has been relieved without complications. The patient has also had a hemodialysis session with 3 kg of ultrafiltration.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.9-8.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 280-379 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.3-5.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.23 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27-30 mmHg
* Glucose: 84-109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 23.3/36.2/2.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 38/0.23, Differential-Neuts: 77.4%, Lymph: 13.6%, Mono: 4.8%, Eos: 3.6%, Ca++: 9.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 4.4 mg/dL

The patient has undergone various imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, which showed no change.

3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count and differential count may indicate an increased risk of infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels and hemodynamic monitoring may indicate a risk of renal failure.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels may indicate a risk of hypoglycemia.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count and INR may indicate a risk of bleeding.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's DVT prophylaxis and dialysis catheter may increase the risk of thrombosis.
8. Pressure injuries: The patient's skin assessment and pressure in the 80s may indicate a risk of pressure injuries.
9. Sepsis: The patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and differential count may indicate a risk of sepsis.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications and adjust the patient's treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  Successful
   recannalization in OR yesterday.
   - Held coumadin, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD prn
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - CPAP overnight as needed
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, will have today, may require UF
   tomorrow after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol, however as patient responded so well to
   diltiazem yesterday, may consider switching to PO diltiazem via a dilt
   drip if goes into RVR again.
   - Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA, was transferred to the ICU for IP evaluation of frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial and was successfully recannalized in the OR yesterday. The patient's ESRD on HD is managed with HD provided for volume removal, and desmopressin was ordered for platelet dysfunction to the OR. The patient's afib was poorly controlled on metoprolol when admitted, but was switched to diltiazem with better control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue due to her underlying conditions, and she may require continued respiratory support.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's trachea stenosis may lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to further complications, such as volume overload, electrolyte imbalances, and bleeding.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's afib may lead to further complications, such as stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Leg wounds: The patient's leg wounds may become infected or develop further complications, such as cellulitis or abscesses.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her underlying ESRD, leading to further complications, such as fatigue, weakness, or decreased immune function.
7. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions, leading to further complications, such as decreased quality of life or increased risk of depression.
8. MRSA: The patient's MRSA screen is pending, and if positive, may lead to further complications, such as skin or soft tissue infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications."
