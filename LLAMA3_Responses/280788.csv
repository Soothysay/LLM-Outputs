   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by
   phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**]; H - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and was intubated due to acute respiratory distress.

The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been re-intubated due to self-extubation and acidemia, likely caused by hypoventilation. There is no evidence of profound intrapulmonary process, and the lung parenchyma appears normal.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 43 beats per minute, and her cardiac dysfunction is likely contributing to her condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 122/51 mmHg, and her hypotension is likely multifactorial, including poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PTT, INR, and low platelets, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Liver dysfunction may also be contributing to the coagulopathy.
5. Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis, likely due to her respiratory failure and poor tissue perfusion.
6. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, and her ARF is likely due to hypovolemia and ATN from cardiac arrest.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
8. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL, and her platelet count is 91 K/uL, suggesting anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued antibiotics to cover HAP
2. Fibrinogen replacement to treat coagulopathy
3. IVF boluses to treat hypotension
4. Renal dose medications to avoid nephrotoxins
5. Limitation of sedatives to avoid compromising patient comfort
6. Removal of femoral line and central access to avoid further complications
7. Discussion of goals of care with family, including DNR status
8. Monitoring of patient's clinical status and adjustment of treatment plan as necessary.

The patient's condition is deteriorating, and her family has expressed a wish to not escalate care. The patient's grandson can be reached by phone for any updates or questions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, hypertension, and a history of CVA, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR, and a recent left-sided pleural effusion that has improved. She has been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and a possible pulmonary embolism.

The patient's recent events include an unplanned extubation, which was re-intubated for acidemia. She has a slow leak from her femoral line, which needs to be addressed. Her blood cultures show 1/4 GPC in pairs and clusters.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 43 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/51 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show an elevated troponin, lactic acidosis, and a possible coagulopathy with an elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets. Her electrolytes are also abnormal, with a low potassium level.

The patient's plan includes continuing vanc/zosyn to cover HAP, considering an ECHO to assess for RV strain, and holding empiric anticoagulation at this time. She will also receive ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers and hold on steroids for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further acidemia and hypoxemia.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's myocardial infarction can lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's possible HAP and UTI can lead to further infection and sepsis.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia can worsen, leading to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
6. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia can worsen, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury can worsen, leading to further renal failure and electrolyte disturbances.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient's transaminitis can worsen, leading to further liver failure and coagulopathy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 19-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's 24-hour events include an unplanned extubation, which was re-intubated due to acidemia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK) levels, consistent with a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 122/51 mmHg and a heart rate of 43 beats per minute.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's unplanned extubation and re-intubation may have increased the risk of pneumonia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's myocardial infarction may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis.
5. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and respiratory failure.
6. DVT: The patient's immobility and the use of central venous catheters may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
7. VAP: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of a central venous catheter may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. Myocardial rupture: The patient's myocardial infarction may increase the risk of myocardial rupture.
10. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's myocardial infarction may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade.

Based on the patient's underlying condition and the potential medical complications that can arise, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and hemodynamic status. The patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and the potential complications that can arise, and the patient's code status should be respected."

   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Current satting 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural
   effusion persists though likely not large enough to cause agonal
   breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear too bad--no
   ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion of overt pulm edema on
   CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show
   bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated

   - consider ECHO to assess for RV strain
   - hold empiric anticoagulation at this time
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers
   - hold on steroids for now
   .
   # Hypotension:  This is likely hypovolemic in setting of poor po
   intake.  Also concern for sepsis given lactate but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be cardiac.

   # Coagulopathy:  DIC is a concern with elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  No active
   bleeding.  INR increasing, likely nutritional, however also with
   elevated LFTs.
   - check hemolysis labs, peripheral smear for schistocytes

   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis

   # Elevated troponin:  Likely from cardiac arrest.  Did not appear to
   have received electric shocks.
   - serial CEs, EKG
   - ASA
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Current satting 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural
   effusion persists though likely not large enough to cause agonal
   breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear too bad--no
   ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion of overt pulm edema on
   CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show
   bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated
   on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - consider ECHO to assess for RV strain
   - hold empiric anticoagulation at this time
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers
   - hold on steroids for now
   .
   # Hypotension:  This is likely hypovolemic in setting of poor po
   intake.  Also concern for sepsis given lactate but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be cardiac.

   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - serial CEs
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  DIC is a concern with elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  No active
   bleeding.  INR increasing, likely nutritional, however also with
   elevated LFTs.
   - check hemolysis labs, peripheral smear for schistocytes
   - trend coags, CBC

   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # Elevated troponin:  Likely from cardiac arrest.  Did not appear to
   have received electric shocks.
   - serial CEs, EKG
   - ASA
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and intubated. The patient has undergone several interventions, including cardiac arrest, and has been treated with various medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's SpO2 is 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of L-sided effusion. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and the blood pressure is 122/51 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is not reported, but the patient is receiving IV fluids and has a fluid balance of 1,594 mL.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL.
* Liver: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 602 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 684 IU/L.
* Coagulation: The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), and low platelet count.
* Electrolytes: The patient's potassium level is 4.9 mEq/L, and the magnesium level is 1.7 mg/dL.
* Blood glucose: The patient's blood glucose level is 121 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the risk of respiratory failure is high.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest is high.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of sepsis due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the patient's immunocompromised state.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the risk of acute kidney injury is high.
5. Liver failure: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and the risk of liver failure is high.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, and the risk of bleeding is high.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and the risk of electrolyte imbalance is high.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the risk of hypotension is high.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following interventions may be necessary:

1. Continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Adjustment of the patient's mechanical ventilation settings to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Administration of antibiotics to prevent sepsis.
4. Management of the patient's coagulopathy with fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions.
5. Monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and administration of electrolyte supplements as necessary.
6. Monitoring of the patient's blood glucose level and administration of insulin as necessary.
7. Monitoring of the patient's creatinine level and administration of dialysis as necessary.
8. Monitoring of the patient's LFTs and administration of medications to prevent liver failure.
9. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and administration of medications to prevent cardiac arrest.
10. Communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure that the patient's goals of care are respected."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Unclear sepsis source, but empirical coverage with antimicrobials.
   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Monitor abd exam
   for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION -- unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in recent past.
   Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious pathology identified
   by abd CT, but need to await final interpretation).  Plan to trend
   serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.  Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  Would like to either resite or d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and intubation. They have a history of self-extubation and required reintubation due to ventilatory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure of 122/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and exhibits bradycardia, which is not accompanied by hemodynamic compromise.

The patient's physical examination reveals a general appearance of being frail and not well-nourished. They have a normal-sized head, ears, nose, and throat, with no signs of poor dentition or nasal congestion. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse, blood pressure, and no signs of cardiac murmur or rub. The respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, and clear breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results indicate mild lactic acid elevation, likely due to hypoperfusion, and mild liver enzyme elevation, possibly related to shock liver or hypotension. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hypocalcemia, which has been repleted. The patient's coagulation profile shows elevated D-dimer levels, indicating potential coagulopathy.

The patient's medical history is significant for respiratory failure, and their code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient's disposition is ICU, and they require ongoing critical care management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest or dysrhythmia, potentially related to the patient's underlying condition or medications.
2. Sepsis or septic shock, potentially related to the patient's respiratory failure or other underlying conditions.
3. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, potentially related to the patient's immobility and underlying conditions.
4. Hypovolemic shock, potentially related to the patient's fluid losses and underlying conditions.
5. Neurological complications, potentially related to the patient's underlying condition or medications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of their respiratory and cardiovascular status, as well as ongoing assessment for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology.  Concerns include hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Unclear sepsis source, but empirical coverage with antimicrobials.
   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. The patient self-extubated yesterday and required reintubation for ventilatory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 44 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a generally well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress. The eyes are normal, and the cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. The patient has a soft and non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present. The skin is warm and has no rash or jaundice.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which has been repleted. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus bradycardia.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to unclear precipitant. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, adjust settings towards spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) and extubation.
2. Pulseless arrest: The patient had a pulseless arrest, which is unclear whether related to the precipitant for admission or possibly related to the induction and intubation event. The plan is to monitor for cardiac event, consider cardiac echo, and neurological evaluation including head CT and EEG.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has unclear etiology for bradycardia, with concerns including hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The plan is to check cardiac echo and TSH.
4. Dilated right atrium: The patient may have right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. The plan is to check echo.
5. Hypotension: The patient has unclear etiology for hypotension, with concerns including hypovolemia, underlying process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation. The plan is to monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which has been repleted. The plan is to monitor ionized calcium.
7. Lactic acid elevation: The patient has mild lactic acid elevation, likely due to hypoperfusion. The plan is to monitor abdominal examination for possible ischemia.
8. Liver function test (LFT) elevation: The patient has mild LFT elevation, which is resolving. The plan is to trend serial LFTs, check amylase and lipase, and consider RUQ ultrasound.
9. Fluids: The patient has hypovolemia, which has improved with aggressive IV repletion in the emergency department. The plan is to monitor I/O.
10. IV access: The patient has IV access via a left femoral line, which will be discontinued and replaced with a peripheral IV.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis

   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis

   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and a recent admission to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and myocardial infarction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The lung parenchyma appears normal, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema or ARDS.
* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 43 beats per minute, which is considered bradycardic. The cause is likely cardiac dysfunction, and the patient's condition is deteriorating.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 138/49 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. The cause is likely multifactorial, including poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, which suggests a coagulopathy. The etiology is likely disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction.
* Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, which is likely due to hypovolemia or ATN from cardiac arrest.
* Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to shock liver or liver dysfunction.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's baseline HCT is 40, and she has thrombocytopenia.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and antihypertensives are not being administered.
* Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's cholesterol levels are not controlled, and simvastatin is not being administered.
* Osteoporosis: The patient's calcium and vitamin D levels are not controlled.

The patient's family has decided not to escalate care, and the patient is not receiving pressors, central access, or CPR. The patient's condition is deteriorating, and the family is aware of the risks involved.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Progressive respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Sepsis
* Coagulopathy
* ARF
* Transaminitis
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Hypertension
* Hypercholesterolemia
* Osteoporosis

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continuing vanc/zosyn for HAP
* F/u CT chest with contrast for possible PE
* Continuing ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
* Limiting sedatives without compromising patient comfort
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Checking U/A and UCx for possible sources of infection
* Following up on blood cultures
* Continuing vanc/zosyn
* Giving 2 units of FFP and vitamin K for coagulopathy
* Removing femoral line and obtaining adequate hemostasis
* Monitoring for signs of ARF
* Renally dosing medications and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Considering a change in antibiotics if the patient's condition deteriorates
* Discussing goals of care with the family and updating them on the patient's condition."

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, hypertension, and a history of CVA, hyponatremia, and chronic respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O. She has a history of chronic respiratory failure and hyperinflation on CXR.
* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 43 bpm, which is considered bradycardic. The patient has a history of cardiac dysfunction, and the ECG shows bilateral atrial enlargement.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 138/49 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. The patient has a history of poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, which suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has liver dysfunction, which may be contributing to the coagulopathy.
* Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.8, which is considered normal. However, the patient's urine output is diminishing, and the creatinine is increasing.
* Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 40, which is considered anemia. The patient also has thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction can worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and possible sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to bleeding or thrombosis.
* Acidemia: The patient's acidemia can worsen, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF can worsen, leading to kidney failure and end-stage renal disease.
* Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis can worsen, leading to liver failure.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the family does not wish to escalate care. The patient's grandson can be reached by phone at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**]."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44.9 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure, and a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 43 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 138/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, midazolam, and fentanyl, for treatment of suspected sepsis. They are also receiving famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. Their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting kidney dysfunction. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of congestive heart failure, respiratory distress, or other significant abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of acute myocardial infarction and ongoing myocardial damage, they are at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to the need for increased ventilator support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Sepsis: The patient's suspected sepsis may progress, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and a higher risk of mortality.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate worsening kidney function, which could lead to the need for dialysis.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal LFTs may indicate ongoing liver damage, which could lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, or other complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of acute myocardial infarction and ongoing cardiovascular instability may increase their risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to complications such as bleeding, shock, or even death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and dementia who was brought to the ED in acute respiratory distress and intubated. She has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure, and possible sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 43 beats per minute, which is likely due to cardiac dysfunction.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 138/49 mmHg, which is likely multifactorial and may be due to poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction.
* Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis, which may be due to chronic respiratory disease and poor tissue perfusion.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline Cr is 0.8, which may be due to hypovolemia or ATN from cardiac arrest.
* Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to shock liver from cardiac arrest or liver dysfunction.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 40 and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to chronic disease or bleeding.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, but hypertension is not a current concern.
* Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's lipid profile is not currently a concern.
* Osteoporosis: The patient is receiving calcium and vitamin D supplements.
* Communication: The patient's family has been informed of her deteriorating condition and has chosen not to escalate care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and she may be at risk for sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, requiring increased ventilatory support.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function may continue to deteriorate, leading to cardiac arrest.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
* Acidemia: The patient's acidemia may worsen, leading to further respiratory and cardiac compromise.
* ARF: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to further kidney damage and electrolyte imbalance.
* Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen, leading to further liver dysfunction and coagulopathy.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status
* IVF boluses as needed for hypotension
* Check U/A and UCx for possible sources of infection
* Follow-up Bcxs for sepsis
* Check LFTs for liver dysfunction
* Cont. vanc/zosyn for HAP
* Give 2 units FFP for coagulopathy
* Pull femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
* IVFs for lactic acidosis
* Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins for ARF
* Hepatitis panel pending for transaminitis
* Remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
* Continue calcium and vitamin D supplements for osteoporosis
* Discuss goals of care with family and respect their wishes not to escalate care."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was brought to the ED in acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She has been diagnosed with myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has developed bradycardia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, bacteremia, and abnormal liver function tests. She has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis, and her baseline creatinine level is 0.8. She is also experiencing transaminitis and anemia/thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate levels suggest that she may be developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may be related to cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if not managed properly, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 0.8 and her recent IV contrast exposure may increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis and abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding complications, and increased risk of infection.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's poor oral intake and lack of nutrition may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysfunction.
2. Manage the patient's respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk, and consider transfusions or other interventions as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver-directed therapy if necessary.
5. Provide adequate nutrition and hydration to the patient, and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's cardiac dysfunction and respiratory failure.
7. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and granddaughter about the patient's condition and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology.  Concerns include hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology.  Concerns include hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in terms of precipitant, and no evidence of pneumonia, infection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism is present. The patient's cardiac status is also unstable, with a pulseless arrest event that has been stabilized without further hemodynamic complications. The patient's bradycardia is unclear in terms of etiology, and concerns include hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease.

The patient has several laboratory results that are abnormal, including:

* Elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible cardiac injury
* Elevated lactate levels, indicating possible hypoperfusion
* Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are resolving but unclear in terms of etiology
* Hypocalcemia, which has been repleted
* Bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin
* Dilation of the right atrium, which may represent right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension

The patient's fluid status is also concerning, with hypovolemia that has improved with aggressive IV repletion in the emergency department. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. The patient's total time spent in the ICU is 35 minutes.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias
* Hypothyroidism or other endocrine disorders
* Liver or kidney injury
* DVT or pulmonary embolism
* VAP or other ventilator-associated complications
* Hypocalcemia or other electrolyte imbalances
* Fluid overload or dehydration

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and the precipitant of the respiratory failure is unclear.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating possible cardiac damage. The patient's ECG shows sinus bradycardia, which may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's TSH level is greater than 25, indicating hypothyroidism, which may be contributing to the bradycardia.

The patient's physical examination shows signs of hypotension, and the patient's blood pressure is being monitored. The patient's lactate level is elevated, indicating possible hypoperfusion, and the patient's LFTs are mildly elevated, possibly due to shock liver from hypotension.

The patient's medical history includes a history of thyroid disease, and the patient's family history is significant for cardiovascular disease.

The patient's plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, adjusting the ventilator settings towards spontaneous breathing trials, and assessing for cardiac events. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK levels indicate possible cardiac damage, which may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level greater than 25 indicates hypothyroidism, which may lead to further complications such as bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest if left untreated.
4. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate level indicate possible sepsis, which may lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant amount of fluid being administered, which may lead to fluid overload and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and intubated. She has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR, and has been treated with ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers. She has also been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction and has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation caused by deconditioning or sedation. She has a history of COPD and hyperinflated on CXR, which may contribute to her respiratory failure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely caused by cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with levothyroxine.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, caused by poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with IVF boluses.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely caused by DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and liver dysfunction. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with vitamin K.
5. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia is likely caused by respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with IVFs.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely caused by hypovolemia and ATN (acute tubular necrosis) from cardiac arrest. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with IVFs.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely caused by shock liver from cardiac arrest. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with hepatitis panel.
8. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely caused by chronic kidney disease and cardiac arrest. She has a history of cardiac arrest and has been treated with T&S (transfusion and splenectomy).

Based on the patient's progress note, it appears that she has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, ARF, transaminitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She has a code status of DNR and has been treated with various medications and interventions to manage her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, recent echo shows mildly
   dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this time.  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.  No recent blood
   gases given that art line dc
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes trending down
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - femoral line removed yesterday, crit stabilized
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, recent echo shows mildly
   dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this time.  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.  No recent blood
   gases given that art line dc
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes trending down
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

* Hypotension: worsening hypovolemia, sepsis, and potential need for vasopressors and inotropes
* Coagulopathy: worsening bleeding, potential need for FFP and platelet transfusions, and potential risk of cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding
* Acidemia: worsening respiratory acidosis, lactic acidosis, and potential need for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors
* ARF: worsening kidney injury, potential need for dialysis, and potential risk of cardiovascular and neurological complications
* Transaminitis: worsening liver dysfunction, potential need for liver transplantation, and potential risk of coagulopathy and bleeding
* Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, potential need for blood transfusions, and potential risk of bleeding and infection
* Hypertension: worsening hypertension, potential need for antihypertensives, and potential risk of cardiovascular and renal complications
* Hypercholesterolemia: worsening hypercholesterolemia, potential need for statins, and potential risk of cardiovascular and neurological complications
* Osteoporosis: worsening osteoporosis, potential need for bisphosphonates, and potential risk of fractures and osteopenia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a
   history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and dementia who was brought to the ED for lethargy and was intubated due to acute respiratory distress. She has a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and respiratory failure. She is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5, but has a history of bilateral effusions and hyperinflated lungs on CXR. She also has a history of COPD.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 45 bpm and a blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. Her physical examination reveals a supple neck, regular rate and rhythm, and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 35.0 g/L, and a platelet count of 91 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 684 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 602 IU/L. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and coagulopathy. She is also at risk for sepsis, acidemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and she has bacteremia, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. She has a history of bilateral effusions and hyperinflated lungs on CXR, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is 91 x 10^9/L, and her prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated, which may indicate coagulopathy.
4. Acidemia: The patient's pH is 7.24, which may indicate acidemia.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
6. Myocardial infarction: The patient has a diagnosis of AMI, which may indicate ongoing cardiac damage.
7. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is 50 mmHg, which may indicate respiratory acidosis.

Based on the patient's medical conditions and potential complications, it is recommended that she be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44.9 kg male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute respiratory failure. He has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 45 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His white blood cell count is 7.2 K/uL, and his platelet count is 91. His hemoglobin level is 9.5 g/dL, and his creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his respiratory failure, and his neurological examination is not assessable.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation make him at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation and potential for aspiration increase his risk for developing VAP.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's myocardial infarction and ongoing cardiac damage make him at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing infection and potential for secondary infections increase his risk for developing sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and potential for worsening respiratory function make him at risk for developing respiratory failure.
6. Worsening cardiac function: The patient's ongoing myocardial damage and potential for further cardiac damage make him at risk for developing worsening cardiac function.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and potential for further renal damage make him at risk for developing renal failure."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis

   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She has a history of CVA, hypertension, and hyponatremia (thought to be SIADH). The patient remains bradycardic, hemodynamically stable, and has been receiving maintenance fluids and nutrition.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, and a respiratory acidosis. The lung parenchyma appears normal, with no evidence of pulmonary edema or ground glass opacity on CT chest.

The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to DIC, with elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, fibrinogen, and HCT. Liver dysfunction may also be a contributing factor. The patient has a lactic acidosis and a chronic respiratory acidosis.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a baseline Cr of 0.8, and may be worsened by the IV contrast used for CT torso. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a baseline HCT of 40.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, and antihypertensives were previously held. The patient has hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's family has been informed of her deteriorating clinical status and has expressed a desire to limit further interventions, including no pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to underlying chronic respiratory disease and the presence of a pleural effusion.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis may worsen, leading to further acidemia and potential organ dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, including pneumonia, empyema, and UTI, which could exacerbate her underlying conditions.
7. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function may worsen, leading to further bradycardia, hypotension, and potential cardiac arrest.

Based on this information, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation while awaiting final
   family decision regarding extubation and comfort care.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is being treated for possible underlying lung disease. The patient's condition is unclear, and the precipitant for admission is unknown. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, pulseless arrest, and bradycardia, which may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient also has bacteremia, dilated right atrium, hypotension, and hypocalcemia, which are being treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and pulseless arrest increases the risk of future cardiac arrest, which could be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and possible sepsis source may lead to further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not treated, leading to further bradycardia and potential cardiac complications.
5. Right Atrial Dilatation: The patient's dilated right atrium may be a sign of underlying right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may worsen if not treated, leading to further cardiac complications and potential arrhythmias.
8. Lactic Acid Elevation: The patient's mild lactic acid elevation may be a sign of hypoperfusion, which could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including cardiac rhythm and blood pressure, to prevent cardiac arrest and potential cardiac complications.
3. Continue antimicrobial therapy to treat the patient's bacteremia and possible sepsis.
4. Replace thyroid hormone to treat the patient's hypothyroidism.
5. Monitor the patient's right atrial dilatation and consider further evaluation with echocardiography to rule out underlying right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension.
6. Manage the patient's hypotension and fluid overload to prevent further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including calcium, to prevent further complications.
8. Trend serial lactate levels to monitor the patient's response to treatment and prevent further organ dysfunction and potential multi-organ failure.
9. Consider further evaluation with abdominal CT and RUQ ultrasound to rule out underlying pathology contributing to the patient's LFT elevation."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and has been receiving sedation to manage agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 46 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 144/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate, creatinine, and liver enzymes, which may indicate hypoperfusion, sepsis, or liver dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for respiratory failure, and the patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient has also received sedation and analgesia, including midazolam and fentanyl.

The patient's physical examination reveals a chronically ill-appearing individual with a normal temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, and the patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and will be assessed for cardiac event.
* Pulseless arrest: The patient's pulseless arrest is unclear, but possible causes include sepsis, cardiac arrest, or neurological event. The patient will be monitored and assessed for cardiac injury.
* Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is unclear, but possible causes include hypothyroidism, hypothermia, or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient will have a cardiac echo and TSH level checked.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is elevated, and the patient will be treated with IV synthroid.
* Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, and will continue to receive antibiotics.
* Dilated right atrium: The patient's dilated right atrium may be due to right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear, but possible causes include hypovolemia, underlying process, or induction/intubation. The patient will be monitored and maintained with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 60 mmHg.
* Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia will be repleted, and the patient will be monitored for ionized calcium levels.
* Lactic acid elevation: The patient's lactic acid elevation is mild and likely due to hypoperfusion. The patient will be monitored and assessed for possible ischemia.
* LFT elevation: The patient's LFT elevation is resolving, and the patient will be monitored with serial LFTs, amylase, and lipase levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Cardiac event: The patient's bradycardia and pulseless arrest may be indicative of a cardiac event, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest and death.
* Neurological event: The patient's pulseless arrest and elevated lactate levels may be indicative of a neurological event, which can lead to neurological dysfunction and death.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to hypothyroidism-related complications such as bradycardia and hypothermia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, recent echo shows mildly
   dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this time.  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.  No recent blood
   gases given that art line dc
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes trending down
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - femoral line removed yesterday, crit stabilized
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, and possible sepsis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure of 124/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of COPD and hyperinflated lungs on CXR.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Her blood cultures are positive for GPC in clusters and pairs, and she has a history of bacteremia. She is receiving vancomycin and levothyroxine, and her family does not wish to escalate her care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to deconditioning, sedation, and possible sepsis. She may require further interventions to improve her respiratory status, such as adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings or adding bronchodilators.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and history of bacteremia suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis. She should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to hypovolemia, cardiac arrest, and possible ATN. She may require further interventions to improve her renal function, such as IV fluids and renal-dose medications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to DIC, liver dysfunction, and possible sepsis. She should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding and receive further interventions as necessary.
5. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia is likely due to respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis. She may require further interventions to improve her acid-base status, such as adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings or adding IV fluids.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest. Her liver enzymes are trending down, and she may require further interventions to improve her liver function.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of medications. She may require further interventions to improve her blood count, such as transfusions or platelet aggregation inhibitors.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and further interventions to improve her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function. Her family should be educated on her condition and treatment plan, and her code status should be respected."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and intubated. She has a poor IV access and has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure of 124/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR, and has been treated with ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers. She has also been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to deconditioning or sedation, but there is no evidence of profound intrapulmonary process. However, she has a history of COPD and hyperinflated lungs, which may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has a history of CVA and myocardial infarction, which may increase her risk of cardiac dysfunction. Her bradycardia may be due to cardiac dysfunction or hypothyroidism.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and has been treated with vancomycin, which may increase her risk of sepsis. Her lactate level is elevated, which may indicate sepsis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to DIC or liver dysfunction. Her platelet count is low, and her fibrinogen level is low, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
5. Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis, which may increase her risk of acidemia.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 0.8, which may indicate acute kidney injury. Her urine output is adequate, but her creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate worsening kidney function.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which may be due to shock liver or liver dysfunction. Her liver enzymes are trending down, but she may still be at risk of liver failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk of several medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, sepsis, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury, and transaminitis. Her poor IV access and history of CVA and myocardial infarction may increase her risk of complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure, and sepsis. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 46 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/45 mmHg. He has a normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of respiratory distress or cardiac instability. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial damage, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), suggesting liver dysfunction. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a normal white blood cell count, but his platelet count is low.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's AMI and low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding and cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, or pulmonary edema.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis and elevated lactate levels may increase the risk of septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, or death.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal LFTs may indicate liver dysfunction, which may increase the risk of bleeding, coagulopathy, or liver failure.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and receive adequate nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which may exacerbate his underlying conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's inability to eat and receive adequate nutrition may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient's immobility and poor perfusion may increase the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, or decubitus ulcers.
8. Infection: The patient's immobility and invasive lines may increase the risk of infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Psychiatric complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and immobility may increase the risk of psychiatric complications, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is being managed with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator, with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 35.0 g/L, and platelet count of 91 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 135 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L, and chloride level of 102 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there is a delay in weaning from the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and temperature may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of pulseless arrest and the presence of cardiac disease increase the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not treated, leading to further bradycardia and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and the presence of indwelling lines and tubes increase the risk of infection.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of VAP, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged intubation and critical illness increase the risk of stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and death.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation while awaiting final
   family decision regarding extubation and comfort care.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, and bradycardia. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is receiving antibiotics for bacteremia. The patient's cardiac status is unstable, with concerns for cardiac injury, sepsis, and evolving hypothyroidism. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia and lactic acid elevation. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, and the patient has a history of shock liver.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and is at risk for developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is untreated, and there is a risk of further complications, including bradycardia, hypothermia, and thyroid mass.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, and there is a risk of further liver damage, which could lead to liver failure.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is abnormal, and there is a risk of further kidney injury, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and is at risk for developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of further cardiovascular complications, including cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is abnormal, and there is a risk of further neurological complications, including cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with ongoing respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with a stable hemodynamic profile. The patient's labs and radiology results are unchanged, with no evidence of pneumonia, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and their blood pressure is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and the risk of further respiratory deterioration is high. Close monitoring and weaning of ventilator support as tolerated is necessary.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's pulseless arrest and bradycardia may be related to underlying cardiac disease or medication effects. Cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram and neurological evaluation, is necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment options.
3. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture is positive for CNS bacteria, and the risk of sepsis is high. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, is necessary.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is elevated, and hypothyroidism may be contributing to bradycardia. Replacement therapy with iv synthroid is necessary.
5. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy should be initiated.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to mechanical ventilation and critical illness. Prophylactic antacid therapy should be initiated.
7. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for VAP due to mechanical ventilation and oral intubation. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be initiated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator support as necessary.
2. Perform cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram and neurological evaluation, to determine the cause and potential treatment options for the patient's cardiac complications.
3. Initiate sepsis protocol and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Replace iv synthroid to treat hypothyroidism.
5. Initiate DVT prophylaxis with anticoagulation therapy.
6. Initiate stress ulcer prophylaxis with antacid therapy.
7. Initiate VAP prophylaxis with antibiotic therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44.4 kg individual who was admitted with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is currently being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 47 bpm (46-53 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 125/52 mmHg (69-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Fentanyl (concentrate) at a rate of 25 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 0.5 mg/hour
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) - last dose at 04:00 AM on [**2149-8-15**]

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 91 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.13 ng/mL
* TCO2: 26 mmHg
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili), elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T), and elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, Lactic Acid).

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's unstable condition, and therefore, no further assessment was performed.

Based on the patient's condition, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's acute myocardial infarction
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory failure
* Infection or sepsis due to the patient's compromised immune system
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes and platelet count
* Kidney injury or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders due to the patient's altered metabolic state

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient remains intubated and ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 35.0 g/L, and platelet count of 91 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 602 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 684 IU/L. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.13 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: unclear precipitant, intubated for agonal breathing, no evidence of pneumonia, infection, or sepsis, possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or neurological event.
2. Pulseless arrest: unclear whether related to admission precipitant or induction and intubation event, currently stabilized without further hemodynamic complications, possible evolving sepsis, monitor, assess for cardiac injury, consider cardiac echo, and consider neurological evaluation including head CT and EEG.
3. Bradycardia: unclear etiology, possible related to hypothyroidism, follow and replace with iv synthroid.
4. Hypothyroidism: TSH > 25, possible contributing to bradycardia, replace with iv synthroid.
5. Bacteremia: CNS from ER blood culture, stop antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: worsening respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac arrest: recurrence of pulseless arrest, cardiac tamponade, or ventricular fibrillation.
3. Sepsis: progression to severe sepsis, septic shock, or organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac injury: progression to myocardial infarction, cardiac rupture, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: progression to cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, or seizure disorder.
6. Hypothyroidism: progression to myxedema coma, hypothermia, or cardiac arrest.
7. Bacteremia: progression to meningitis, endocarditis, or septicemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and to adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - d/ced vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn hypotension or low urine output
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue hold on monitoring as pt, family has decided to d/c blood
   draws
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  No pressors,
   transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been removed,
   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.  Plan to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.

   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.

   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,

   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.

s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman with dementia, was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She has a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia (thought to be SIADH). Her current conditions include:

1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, which may have contributed to her current cardiac condition.
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (NOT ARDS): The patient is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5, with no new x-ray, but has a history of bilateral effusions. Her lung parenchyma does not appear markedly abnormal, and there is no suggestion of overt pulmonary edema on CXR.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has a likely cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been stable recently, but this is likely multifactorial in the setting of poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, low HCT, and low fibrinogen, which is likely due to DIC or liver dysfunction.
6. Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis, which is being managed by holding monitoring for now.
7. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a baseline Cr of 0.8, which is likely due to hypovolemia in the setting of poor PO intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.
8. Transaminitis: The patient has liver enzymes trending down, which may be due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
9. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 40, and her T&S is stable following fem line removal.
10. Hypertension: The patient's pressures are stable, and antihypertensives are being held.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and lactate, there is a concern for sepsis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of COPD and hyperinflated lungs, which may increase her risk for PE.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of CVA and HTN, which may increase her risk for cardiac arrest.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's ARF may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's transaminitis and coagulopathy may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to liver failure.
6. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may increase her risk for bleeding.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly.

The patient's family has expressed a desire to discuss goals of care, and the patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status. The family does not wish to escalate care, and the patient's clinical status is deteriorating."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45 kg adult in the ICU with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 46 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 bpm, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin and cardiac enzymes, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's platelet count is low, and their liver enzymes are elevated. The patient is at risk for bleeding and hepatic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing myocardial injury increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures.
4. Hepatic complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes increase the risk of hepatic dysfunction and failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, given their respiratory failure and invasive lines.
6. Renal complications: The patient's low blood pressure and cardiac injury increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).
7. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac injury and hypotension increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.

   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins

   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and was intubated. The patient has a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and possible sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 46 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/51 mmHg. The patient is intubated and on volume assist with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of bilateral effusions, COPD, and hyperinflated lungs on CXR. The lung parenchyma does not appear markedly abnormal, and there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema on CXR or ground glass opacity on CT chest.

The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, which is likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction. The patient has also developed acidemia, which is likely due to respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a baseline creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, which is likely due to hypovolemia and ATN from cardiac arrest. The patient has also developed transaminitis, which may be due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to blood loss or bone marrow suppression. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and the patient's hypercholesterolemia is being managed with simvastatin.

The patient's DNR/DNI status is currently being discussed with the family, and they do not wish to escalate care. The patient's central line is being removed, and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs to monitor the patient's condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and failure.
5. AKI: The patient's AKI may worsen, leading to further kidney damage and failure.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen, leading to further liver damage and failure.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications and organ dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient with multiple comorbidities and is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44.4 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure of 132/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lung sounds are clear, and the abdomen is benign.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as decreased platelet count and albumin level. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is greater than 25, indicating hypothyroidism.

The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in its precipitant, and the patient is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. The patient's bradycardia is also unclear in its etiology, but it may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's hypothyroidism will be treated with intravenous synthroid.

The patient's ICU care plan includes starting total parenteral nutrition if the patient remains intubated, managing glycemic control, and providing prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Respiratory failure due to inadequate weaning from the ventilator.
3. Bradycardia due to underlying cardiac conduction disease or hypothyroidism.
4. Hypothyroidism exacerbation due to inadequate treatment.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and lack of prophylactic treatment.
6. Stress ulcer bleeding due to inadequate prophylaxis.
7. Sepsis due to underlying infection or inadequate antibiotic treatment.
8. Cardiac arrest due to bradycardia or underlying cardiac disease.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is being managed in the ICU with close monitoring and treatment of their underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, unclear precipitant. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a history of bradycardia, unclear etiology, which may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is elevated, indicating hypothyroidism.

The patient also has a diagnosis of bacteremia, with a central nervous system (CNS) infection from an ER blood culture. Antibiotics have been stopped.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values, including:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.2-7.9
* Hematocrit (Hct): 35.0-37.6
* Platelet count (Plt): 91-133
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1-1.1

* D-dimer: 2574 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 122 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 335 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning of mechanical ventilation as tolerated
* Stopping antibiotics
* Replacing thyroid hormone with iv synthroid
* Following up on bradycardia
* Monitoring for potential complications such as pneumonia, infection, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or neurological events

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease or other causes
* Bradycardia due to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease
* Bacteremia and sepsis due to CNS infection
* Pneumonia or infection due to immunosuppression
* Pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Neurological events such as CVA or seizure due to underlying conditions or medications
* Cardiac arrest due to bradycardia or other cardiac conditions
* Hypothyroidism-related complications such as myxedema coma
* Medication-related complications such as electrolyte imbalances or allergic reactions"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is an intubated ICU patient with a unclear precipitant for respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure of 132/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, suggesting cardiac injury. The patient's blood culture from the ER shows CNS bacteria, and the antibiotics have been stopped.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is unclear, and it is unclear whether it is related to pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or underlying lung disease.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture shows CNS bacteria, and the patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, suggesting cardiac injury. This could be a sign of sepsis, which is a potential complication of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Injury: The patient's cardiac injury is suggested by the elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, and the patient's pulseless arrest. This could be a sign of cardiac injury, which is a potential complication of respiratory failure.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is suggested by the elevated level of TSH, and the patient's bradycardia. This could be a contributing factor to the patient's bradycardia.
5. Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture shows CNS bacteria, which could be a sign of bacteremia, a potential complication of respiratory failure.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and ventilation could increase the risk of VAP, a potential complication of respiratory failure.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's ICU care could increase the risk of stress ulcer, a potential complication of respiratory failure.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheter could increase the risk of DVT, a potential complication of respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and it is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical course to identify potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 40%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue goal of care discussions with family.  Pt made CMO
   yesterday
   - continue current vent strategy
   - no abx at this time given CMO status
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   hold UOP monitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - holding IVFs, UOP, blood monitoring given CMO status
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  No pressors,
   transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been removed,
   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Pt made CMO yesterday ([**8-17**]), although family
   does not wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue discussion with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was brought to the ED for lethargy and was intubated due to acute respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and has a history of COPD. The patient's family has made her CMO (Comfort Measures Only), and they do not wish to escalate her care or extubate her.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her COPD and the lack of antibiotics.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, and may worsen if not monitored closely.
3. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's labile blood pressure may be related to poor PO intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to her DIC, liver dysfunction, and the lack of blood draws.
5. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia may worsen due to her respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen due to her hypovolemia, ATN from cardiac arrest, and IV contrast.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
8. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen due to her baseline HCT of 40.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia may worsen due to her elevated LFTs.
10. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may worsen due to her calcium and vitamin D deficiency.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory failure, bradycardia, labile blood pressure, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis will be closely monitored and managed according to the patient's CMO status. The patient's family will be updated on her condition, and the healthcare team will continue to discuss goals of care with them. The patient will continue to receive comfort measures only, and no further interventions will be performed without the family's consent."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and dementia, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and intubation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lung parenchyma appears normal on CT chest, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR.

The patient has a history of COPD and hyperinflation on CXR, which may be contributing to the respiratory failure. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of anticoagulant medications. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels, which may be indicative of liver dysfunction.

The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a baseline Cr of 0.8 mg/dL, which may be related to hypovolemia, ATN from cardiac arrest, and the use of nephrotoxic medications. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury. The patient's family has decided to make the patient a DNR (do not resuscitate) and has chosen not to escalate care, which may limit the patient's treatment options.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of COPD and hyperinflation on CXR, the patient may be at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate and bacteremia, which may indicate sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the patient may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, particularly given the patient's history of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and the patient may be at risk for developing renal failure.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient may be at risk for developing hepatic failure.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and the patient's family has made the decision to limit the patient's treatment options. The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury, and the patient is at risk for developing additional complications, including pneumonia, sepsis, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, and hepatic failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, hypertension, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and intubated. She has a myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), acute respiratory failure, and a coagulopathy. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, lactate, and D-dimer, indicating possible sepsis. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and her chest X-ray shows hyperinflation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her urine output is decreasing, and she has a profound bradycardia and hypotension in the morning, which improved after lightening sedation.

The patient's family has decided to make her a comfort measure only (CMO) patient, but not to terminate her life support. They have also decided not to escalate her care, and she is not receiving pressors, transcutaneous pacing, or atropine.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate and D-dimer levels, indicating possible sepsis. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to deconditioning or sedation, but there is no evidence of a profound intrapulmonary process. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her respiratory failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver dysfunction, or a combination of both. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her coagulopathy.
4. Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and a lactic acidosis, which may be due to her respiratory failure and sepsis. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her acidemia.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI is likely due to hypovolemia, ATN from cardiac arrest, or a combination of both. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her AKI.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her transaminitis.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to her underlying medical conditions and her coagulopathy. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely due to her underlying medical conditions. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her hypertension.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia is likely due to her underlying medical conditions. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her hypercholesterolemia.
10. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis is likely due to her underlying medical conditions. Her family has decided not to escalate her care, which may make it difficult to manage her osteoporosis."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - d/ced vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn hypotension or low urine output
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue hold on monitoring as pt, family has decided to d/c blood
   draws
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, hypertension, and a history of CVA, hyponatremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and was intubated.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. She has a history of bilateral effusions and mild dilated RA on recent echo. The lung parenchyma appears normal, and the patient is not showing signs of overt pulmonary edema.
* Cardiac: The patient has a history of cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, and her bradycardia is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.
* Hemodynamics: The patient is hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output, but her blood pressure is low, likely due to poor PO intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, and low HCT. Liver dysfunction may also be a contributing factor.
* Acidemia: The patient has a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
* Renal function: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to hypovolemia, ATN from cardiac arrest, and levofloxacin use.
* Liver function: The patient has transaminitis likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
* Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to underlying medical conditions.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and antihypertensives have been held.
* Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's simvastatin has been discontinued due to elevated liver enzymes.
* Osteoporosis: The patient's calcium and vitamin D have been discontinued.
* Communication: The patient's family has been informed of her deteriorating clinical status, and they have decided to make her a comfort measure only (CMO) patient.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and possible sources of infection, sepsis is a potential complication.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she may require further management to prevent respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's history of cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, cardiac arrest is a potential complication.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and possible liver dysfunction may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's AKI may worsen, and further management may be necessary to prevent renal failure.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's transaminitis may worsen, and further management may be necessary to prevent hepatic failure.
* Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, and further management may be necessary to prevent bleeding.

The patient's family has decided to make her a CMO patient, and the plan is to terminally extubate her. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, and oxygen delivery is set at 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial damage. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, and the platelet count is slightly decreased. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 602 IU/L and an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 684 IU/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a regular rhythm with a normal rate, and the patient's lungs are clear to auscultation. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the patient's extremities are without edema or calf pain.

The patient's medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction, and the patient's family is still deciding whether to terminate life-sustaining interventions. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's myocardial infarction increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac rupture, and heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hypoxia.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and stress ulcer prophylaxis increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac arrest history increase the risk of neurological complications such as stroke and seizures.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and presence of central lines increase the risk of thrombosis.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia increase the risk of organ dysfunction and failure.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination. The patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and treatment options, and the patient's code status should be respected."

   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]

   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Stable on volume assist with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5, with a respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, with a labile blood pressure.
* Hematological: Coagulopathy likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and liver dysfunction, with a low platelet count and low fibrinogen.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to hypovolemia and ATN from cardiac arrest, with a baseline Cr of 0.8.
* Hepatic: Transaminitis likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest, with elevated liver enzymes.
* Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Baseline HCT is 40, with a stable critical care status.
* Hypercholesterolemia: D/c simvastatin for elevated LFTs.
* Osteoporosis: D/c calcium and vitamin D.

The patient's family has made the decision to make her a comfort measure only (CMO) patient, and they do not wish to escalate her care. The patient is not responding to sedatives, and her family does not want to use pressors, transcutaneous pacing, or CPR.

The patient's current medications include:

* Fentanyl (concentrate) 25 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed) 0.5 mg/hour
* Famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg IV every 12 hours
* Ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD

The patient's current labs are:

* WBC: 7.2-7.9 K/uL
* Hct: 35.0-37.6%
* Plt: 91-133 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1-1.1 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.13-0.13 ng/mL

Based on the patient's current condition, the potential medical complications that can arise are:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis
* Cardiac arrest due to bradycardia and labile blood pressure
* Bleeding due to coagulopathy and liver dysfunction
* Renal failure due to AKI and ATN from cardiac arrest
* Hepatic failure due to transaminitis and shock liver from cardiac arrest
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppression and liver dysfunction
* Hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis due to lack of treatment and underlying medical conditions.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting her care plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Respiratory failure: progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for invasive mechanical ventilation
* Bradycardia: progression to cardiac arrest, need for cardiac pacing or cardioversion
* Hypothyroidism: progression to myxedema coma, need for thyroid hormone replacement
* Infections: development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), or other hospital-acquired infections
* Hemodynamic instability: progression to shock, need for vasopressor therapy
* Metabolic derangements: development of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, need for insulin or glucagon therapy
* Neurological complications: development of seizures, need for anticonvulsant therapy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45 kg individual who has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 148/58 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl and midazolam for comfort, as well as famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2-5.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 35-30 g/L, and platelet count of 91-94 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a potassium level of 4.5 mmol/L, sodium level of 137 mmol/L, and chloride level of 103 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. The patient's respiratory failure is managed with continued mechanical ventilation and focus on comfort with versed and fentanyl. The patient's bradycardia is unclear in etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's hypothyroidism is managed by holding thyroid replacement.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to respiratory muscle weakness, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and increased risk of respiratory failure.
2. Bradycardia: Prolonged bradycardia can lead to cardiac arrest, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Hypothyroidism: Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to decreased metabolic rate, increased risk of infection, and decreased cardiac function.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: Prolonged immobility can lead to deep vein thrombosis, which can increase the risk of pulmonary embolism and stroke.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged stress can lead to stress ulcer, which can increase the risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal complications.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: Prolonged mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can increase the risk of mortality.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: Prolonged immobility can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.
8. Cardiovascular complications: Prolonged bradycardia and hypothyroidism can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is unclear, but they are intubated for respiratory failure, which is likely due to an unclear precipitant. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 148/58 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.2-7.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 91-133 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with potassium levels of 3.9-4.4 mmol/L and magnesium levels of 1.9-2.7 mmol/L.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's blood gases are not available, but the respiratory rate is set at 6 breaths per minute with a spontaneous rate of 1 breath per minute.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a blood pressure of 148/58 mmHg and a heart rate of 57 beats per minute. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with no evidence of seizures or cardiac arrest.

The patient's underlying conditions include hypothyroidism, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 25 mU/L. The patient's hypothyroidism is likely contributing to their bradycardia, and they will be treated with intravenous synthroid.

The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, which may be due to an unclear precipitant. The patient's bradycardia may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's hypothyroidism may also be contributing to their hypothermia.

Based on the provided information, the patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an unclear precipitant, but it may be related to underlying lung disease, pneumonia, or sepsis.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is likely contributing to their bradycardia and hypothermia.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may be related to their hypothyroidism or underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and they require close monitoring and treatment to manage their multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, unclear precipitant, with intubation for agonal breathing
* Bradycardia, unclear etiology, possibly related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease
* Hypothyroidism, confirmed with TSH > 25, contributing to bradycardia
* Unknown underlying lung disease

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Pneumonia or infection due to prolonged intubation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infection or respiratory failure
* Pulmonary embolism due to immobility and respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias due to bradycardia or underlying cardiac disease
* Neurological events such as CVA or seizure due to unknown etiology
* Respiratory failure exacerbation due to underlying lung disease

The plan of care includes weaning the patient off the ventilator as tolerated and re-exploring extubation with the family. The patient will also be replaced with iv synthroid to manage hypothyroidism."

Summary:

The patient is a 45 kg adult admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute respiratory failure. They are receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and analgesia. Their vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 123/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 426 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial damage. Their white blood cell count is within normal limits, but their platelet count is low. Their liver function tests are elevated, with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Their kidney function is also impaired, with increased levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's AMI may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's low blood pressure and heart rate may indicate hypovolemia, sepsis, or cardiac tamponade.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and elevated PT/PTT/INR may indicate a coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding or thrombosis.
6. Renal failure: The patient's impaired kidney function may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or failure, which could lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or liver failure.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated CRP and lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ failure or death.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic status in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 40%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue goal of care discussions with family.  Pt made CMO
   yesterday
   - continue current vent strategy
   - no abx at this time given CMO status
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   hold UOP monitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - holding IVFs, UOP, blood monitoring given CMO status
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.

   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Pt made CMO yesterday ([**8-17**]), although family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and was intubated.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Heart rate: 48 bpm
* Blood pressure: 123/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers for COPD.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.2-7.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 35.0-37.6%
* Platelet count: 91-133 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.13-0.13 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 335 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis. She is also experiencing bradycardia, labile blood pressure, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to bradycardia and electrolyte imbalances
* Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress and COPD
* Sepsis-related organ failure, including kidney and liver failure
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding complications
* Acidemia-related respiratory and cardiac complications
* Acute kidney injury-related electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload
* Transaminitis-related liver dysfunction and coagulopathy
* Anemia-related decreased oxygen delivery and cardiac complications
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding complications

The patient's family has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision, and the patient is not receiving aggressive treatment. The ICU team is focused on providing comfort care and managing the patient's symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]

   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.

   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and intubated. She has a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute respiratory failure. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 111/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and nonresponsive.

The patient has been experiencing labile blood pressure, hypoventilation, and coagulopathy. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, decreased platelet count, and elevated PTT and INR. She has a history of bilateral effusions and a recent echo showing mildly dilated RA.

The patient's family has made the decision to withdraw care and has chosen not to escalate treatment, including pressors, transcutaneous pacing, and CPR. The central line has been removed, and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs to monitor the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may continue to experience hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and her cardiac function may continue to deteriorate.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding or other complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's baseline Cr is 0.8, and her kidney function may continue to decline.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and she may experience further liver dysfunction.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia, and she may be at risk for further infection.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may experience further deficiencies.
8. Worsening of underlying medical conditions: The patient has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR, and may experience further exacerbation of this condition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is deteriorating, and her family has made the decision to withdraw care. The plan is to continue to provide comfort care, including ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD, and to limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort. The patient will not receive antibiotics, pressors, or other interventions that may escalate her care. The family will be updated regularly, and the patient's son and granddaughter will be contacted if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was brought to the ED for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure, and sepsis.

Current vital signs:

* HR: 58 bpm (normal range: 46-68 bpm)
* BP: 111/37 mmHg (normal range: 78-170/30-55 mmHg)
* RR: 5 insp/min (normal range: 5-25 insp/min)
* SpO2: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications:

1. Bradycardia: likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.
2. Labile blood pressure: likely multifactorial, including poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function.
3. Coagulopathy: likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver dysfunction, or other factors.
4. Acidemia: likely due to respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): likely due to hypovolemia, poor oral intake, and ATN from cardiac arrest.
6. Transaminitis: likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest.
7. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: likely due to bleeding and/or bone marrow suppression.
8. Hypercholesterolemia: likely due to statin therapy.

The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) and the family has declined further escalation of care, including pressors, transcutaneous pacing, and CPR. The patient's clinical status is deteriorating, and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs to monitor the patient."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt currently on MMV due to apneic events
   reported by RT overnight.  O2 Sats excellent.  Patient may be candidate
   for extubation based on clinical performance on the vent.  No new xray,
   but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does not
   appear markedly abnormal on CXR.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated
   on CXR.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5, lighten sedation, evaluate RISB and SBT
   for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.
   - plan to discuss with family about goals of care this afternoon.
   - pt on CMO status, with the exception of IV fluids
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   limit urine output moitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -levothyroxine discontinued [**3-17**] CMO
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest
 Stopped
   trending labs when d/c
d blood draws
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line, also CMO
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  No pressors,
   transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been removed,
   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Pt made CMO yesterday ([**8-17**]), although family
   does not wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue discussion with
   son [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**]; H -
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**], and grandaughter (HCP), [**Name (NI) 6979**].  Family meeting planned

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and was intubated. She has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute respiratory failure. She has a history of COPD and hyperinflated lungs on CXR. She is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) due to apneic events and has a stable oxygen saturation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 111/37 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute. She has a mild bradycardia and a slightly elevated lactate level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the patient is not extubated soon.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications if the patient's cardiac function does not improve.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications if the patient's heart rate does not increase.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further bleeding if the patient's coagulation function does not improve.
5. Acidemia: The patient's acidemia is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further acidosis if the patient's respiratory and metabolic function does not improve.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely to continue, and there is a risk of further bleeding if the patient's blood cell count does not improve.
7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further cardiovascular complications if the patient's cholesterol level does not decrease.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further bone fractures if the patient's bone density does not improve.
9. Communication difficulties: The patient's communication difficulties are likely to continue, and there is a risk of further confusion and disorientation if the patient's cognitive function does not improve.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory function closely.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider increasing the patient's heart rate if necessary.
3. Continue coagulation therapy and monitor the patient's coagulation function closely.
4. Monitor the patient's acidemia and consider adjusting the patient's ventilation and medication therapy if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia and consider transfusing blood products if necessary.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's medication therapy to decrease the patient's cholesterol level.
7. Consider referring the patient to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's communication difficulties and consider referring the patient to a speech therapist if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI).
* She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and was intubated.
* The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and her respiratory support has been adjusted to PS 5/5 as tolerated.
* She has experienced apneic events lasting 60 seconds with desaturation into the 30% range, which has raised concerns about her clinical eligibility for extubation.
* The patient has labile blood pressure, which is likely multifactorial due to poor PO intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function.
* She has a coagulopathy likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction, with elevated PTT, INR, and low platelets, fibrinogen, and HCT.
* The patient has resolved acidemia, ARF, and transaminitis, but her anemia and thrombocytopenia remain.
* She has been diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and has a CMO status with limitations on care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's apneic events and desaturation may indicate a need for further evaluation and management of her respiratory status.
* Sepsis: The patient's labile blood pressure, possible sepsis, and elevated lactate levels may indicate a risk for sepsis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly given her low platelet count and fibrinogen levels.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding and may require further evaluation and management.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's recent myocardial infarction and labile blood pressure may indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may require further evaluation and management, particularly given her history of SIADH.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction may be contributing to her coagulopathy and may require further evaluation and management.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
* Evaluate the patient's blood pressure and consider further management of her hypertension.
* Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider further evaluation and management.
* Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia and consider further evaluation and management.
* Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's cardiac dysfunction.
* Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and consider further evaluation and management.
* Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's liver dysfunction.

I also recommend discussing the patient's care with her family and considering their wishes regarding further treatment and management."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   The team has been speaking extensively to family members about goals of
   care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**].  While she is not comfort measures only, the
   family has expressed that they want limited care for the Mr. [**Known lastname 7156**].
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt tolerated PSV for approx 7-8 hours
   yesterday, but overnight, experienced apneic events lasting 60 seconds
   long with desaturation into the 30%
s ([**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN report).  Apnea alarm was
   set at 60 seconds.  Currently trying to evaluate if patient is
   clinically eligible to be extubated.  No new xray, but hx of bilateral
   effusions.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5 as tolerated, lighten sedation, evaluate
   RISB and SBT for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.
   - plan to discuss with family about goals of care again this afternoon,
   after discussion yesterday they may be interested in hospice.
   - pt currently on IV fluids only, will evaluate benefit of additional
   medications
   - nebs discontinued
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   limit urine output moitoring at this time given goal of limited care
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -levothyroxine discontinued due to limited care
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - IV fluids as needed, abx and pressors not indicated at this time per
   discussions with family
   # Coagulopathy:  Resolved on today
s [**Month/Day (2) **]
   # Acidemia
 resolved, however blood gas this morning 7.35.
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  liver enzymes normalizing from likely shock liver
   after cardiac arrest
   - if we draw future [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] monitor
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - will hold on following crits as no currently drawing [**First Name3 (LF) **] unless
   clinically oriented.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family on [**8-17**].  No
   pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been
   removed,  and the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain [**Month/Day (1) **] to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Pt
s family discussed their wishes
   for limited care at a family meeting on [**8-17**], although family does not
   wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue discussion with son
   [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**]; H - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**],
   and grandaughter (HCP), [**Name (NI) 6979**].  Family meeting planned for [**8-19**] to
   discuss possible extubation that is clinically indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   long with desaturation into the 30%

   set at 60 seconds.  Currently trying to evaluate if patient is
   clinically eligible to be extubated.  No new xray, but hx of bilateral
   effusions.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5 as tolerated, lighten sedation, evaluate
   RISB and SBT for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, intubated, and diagnosed with myocardial infarction (STEMI). She has a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia (thought to be SIADH). The patient's family has expressed limited care wishes, and the team has been discussing goals of care with them.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has experienced apneic events with desaturation, and the team is evaluating her clinical eligibility for extubation. She is currently on PSV 5/5 and sedation is being lightened.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has bradycardia, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine has been discontinued due to limited care.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is stable-hypertensive, possibly due to poor PO intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function.
* Coagulopathy: Resolved on today.
* Acidemia: Resolved, but blood gas this morning showed pH 7.35.
* ARF: Resolved.
* Transaminitis: Liver enzymes are normalizing from likely shock liver after cardiac arrest.
* Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Baseline HCT is 40.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's apneic events and desaturation may indicate a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she is not extubated.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's bradycardia and possible cardiac dysfunction may worsen if not addressed.
* Sepsis: The patient's possible sepsis, as indicated by lactate and bacteremia, may lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
* Kidney injury: The patient's diminished kidney function may worsen if not managed appropriately.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and possible sepsis may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's limited care and possible sepsis may increase her risk of hypoglycemia.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to address these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   The team has been speaking extensively to family members about goals of
   care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**].  While she is not comfort measures only, the
   family has expressed that they want limited care for the Mr. [**Known lastname 7156**].
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt tolerated PSV for approx 7-8 hours
   yesterday, but overnight, experienced apneic events lasting 60 seconds
   long with desaturation into the 30%
s ([**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN report).  Apnea alarm was
   set at 60 seconds.  Currently trying to evaluate if patient is
   clinically eligible to be extubated.  No new xray, but hx of bilateral
   effusions.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5 as tolerated, lighten sedation, evaluate
   RISB and SBT for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.
   - plan to discuss with family about goals of care again this afternoon,
   after discussion yesterday they may be interested in hospice.
   - pt currently on IV fluids only, will evaluate benefit of additional
   medications
   - nebs discontinued
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   limit urine output moitoring at this time given goal of limited care
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -levothyroxine discontinued due to limited care
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - IV fluids as needed, abx and pressors not indicated at this time per
   discussions with family
   # Coagulopathy:  Resolved on today
s [**Month/Day (2) **]
   # Acidemia
 resolved, however blood gas this morning 7.35.
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  liver enzymes normalizing from likely shock liver
   after cardiac arrest
   - if we draw future [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] monitor
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - will hold on following crits as no currently drawing [**First Name3 (LF) **] unless
   clinically oriented.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family on [**8-17**].  No
   pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been
   removed,  and the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain [**Month/Day (1) **] to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Pt
s family discussed their wishes
   for limited care at a family meeting on [**8-17**], although family does not
   wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue discussion with son
   [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**]; H - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**],
   and grandaughter (HCP), [**Name (NI) 6979**].  Family meeting planned for [**8-19**] to
   discuss possible extubation that is clinically indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   The team has been speaking extensively to family members about goals of
   care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**].  While she is not comfort measures only, the
   family has expressed that they want limited care for the Mr. [**Known lastname 7156**].
   The patient was extubated yesterday without event and is planned to be
   discharged home on hospice.
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved, Pt extubated yesterday without
   event.  No oxygen requirement.  Will plan to send home to hospice today
   with morphine/ativan for respiratory distress.
   #Bradycardia:  - resolved. likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and
   hypothyroidism.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - patient to be discharged to hospice, do not plan to monitor at home
   as will be in hospice care.
   # Coagulopathy:  Resolved on yesterday
s [**Month/Day (2) **]. No new lab draws to
   evaluate.
   # Acidemia
 resolved. No new [**Month/Day (2) **] today
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  liver enzymes normalizing from likely shock liver
   after cardiac arrest
   - if we draw future [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] monitor
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - no new [**First Name3 (LF) **] this am, sending home for hospice
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - will not restart medications due to discharge home to hospice and
   intent for comfot care only
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D, will not restart on discharge
   as going to hospice
   .
   # Communication: Pt was extuabated and through discussions with family,
   plan is to send Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**] home with hospice care.  Outpatient meds
   will not be restarted, with Morphine elixir and Ativan the only meds
   for use at home for comfort.
