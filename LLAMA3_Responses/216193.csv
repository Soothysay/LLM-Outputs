   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema, metabolic
   derangement.  Is now s/p thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as
   well as low pH suggesting exudative infection.  Thoracentesis was
   complicated by significant bleeding post-procedure, posing concern for
   hemothorax.  Due to liver failure and ESRD, he has dysfunctional
   platelets and low levels of clotting factors.  He has received 2 units
   of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3 additional units following
   procedure given oozing from site. Received DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for and possible definitive procedure for
   empyema given low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - oxygen for comfort
   .
   2. Continued Bleeding
 will be difficult to correct his coagulopathy
   due to underlying medical co-morbidities and worsening liver function.
   - receiving pRBC transfusion now, will obtain post transfusion HCT
   - FFP x 2, additional pRBC
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt (continuous)
   - DDAVP daily for 3 days (currently day 2 of 3)
   - Dialysis may be helpful in correcting platelet dysfunction, though
   patient may be too tenuous for HD or UF.
   - can consider topical fibrin to help with hemostasis of thoracentesis
   site
   .
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c PO vancomycin
   .
   4. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs
   - transplant recs
   - daily tacro levels
   - lactulose [**Hospital1 **] for encephalopathy
   .
   5. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   6. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].
   - will continue Prednisone 10mg PO qday
   - No stress dose steroids in light of large infectious burden

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and multiple comorbidities. He is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress, bleeding, and worsening liver function.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 119 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* White blood cell count: 13.6 x 10^9/L

The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and pericardial window. He has undergone thoracentesis, which was complicated by significant bleeding, and has received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 3 additional units of FFP following the procedure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Bilirubin: 28 mg/dL
* INR: 1.8
* Platelet count: 108 x 10^9/L
* WBC count: 13.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 25.1%
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 101 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 9.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory distress due to empyema, metabolic derangement, and hemothorax.
2. Continued bleeding due to underlying medical comorbidities and worsening liver function.
3. Low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, which may indicate worsening infection.
4. Worsening liver failure, which may be precipitated by infection.
5. ESRD on hemodialysis, which may be complicated by HD line infection.
6. Adrenal insufficiency, which may require stress dose steroids.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuous broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vanc/Cefepime.
2. FFP and additional pRBC transfusions to correct coagulopathy.
3. Serial HCTs and coagulation studies to monitor bleeding.
4. Amicar gtt (continuous) to help with hemostasis of thoracentesis site.
5. DDAVP daily for 3 days to help with hemostasis.
6. Consideration of topical fibrin to help with hemostasis of thoracentesis site.
7. Lactulose for encephalopathy.
8. Prednisone 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency.
9. Nephrology recs for timing of HD given bleeding.
10. ID recs for further management of infection.
11. Thoracic recs for definitive management of empyema.
12. Liver recs for further management of liver failure.
13. Transplant recs for listing for renal transplant.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), but he is willing to be intubated for ventilatory support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of cdiff, a type of bacterial infection, and has undergone multiple interventions, including thoracentesis, dialysis catheter insertion, and PICC line placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are experiencing pain and are receiving morphine for management. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and has been intubated for ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of cdiff and the presence of a dialysis catheter and PICC line increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's need for ventilatory support and the presence of a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of thoracentesis and the presence of a dialysis catheter and PICC line increase the risk of hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of cdiff and the presence of multiple lines and catheters increase the risk of infection.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of sinus tachycardia and the presence of vasopressors increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's history of dialysis and the presence of a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of cdiff and the presence of a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of sinus tachycardia and the presence of a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) increase the risk of neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a chronically ill male who has been admitted to the ICU with a variety of conditions. He has a history of jaundice, and his physical examination is notable for marked scleral icterus with right subconjunctival hemorrhage, marked mucositis with lip bleeding, and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds.

The patient has a PICC line and dialysis catheter in place, and has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including cefipime and vancomycin. He has also received pain medication, including morphine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/46 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 92% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.6, hemoglobin of 25.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 108 x 10^9/L. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 73 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 25 IU/L. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 140 mg/dL.

The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is to be intubated for ventilatory support. He is also to receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying infections and compromised immune system
* Liver failure due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels
* Renal failure due to the patient's impaired renal function
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's need for ventilatory support
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's tachycardia and potential cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's distended abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds
* Infection-related complications due to the patient's presence of a PICC line and dialysis catheter."

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema.  Is now s/p
   thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as well as low pH suggesting
   infection.  Thoracentesis was complicated by significant bleeding
   post-procedure, posing concern for hemothorax.  Due to liver failure
   and ESRD, he has dysfunctional platelets and low levels of clotting
   factors.  He has received 2 units of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3
   additional units following procedure given oozing from site. Received
   DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for definative procedure for empyema given
   low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt ???
   .
   2. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   3. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs

   4. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   5. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old man with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with respiratory distress, bleeding, and low pH in the pleural fluid, suggesting empyema. He has a history of MSSA bacteremia and empyema, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His liver function is worsening, with rising bilirubin levels and INR. He has adrenal insufficiency and is being treated with hydrocortisone and prednisone. He is also experiencing low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, which may be related to worsening infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemothorax: The patient's bleeding from the thoracentesis site and low platelet count increase the risk of hemothorax.
2. Empyema: The patient's empyema is likely to worsen without definitive treatment, which may require a thoracic surgery procedure.
3. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis may indicate a worsening infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's worsening liver function could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding, and decreased production of clotting factors.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may worsen without proper treatment, leading to hypotension, shock, and death.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to complications such as HD line infections, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
7. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen without proper treatment, leading to respiratory failure and death.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's liver disease and ESRD may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke."

Summary:

The patient, a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presents with respiratory distress and bleeding after thoracentesis. Despite transfusions, the patient failed to respond and continues to bleed. A family meeting was held, and the decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only (CMO). The patient's condition is worsening, and further interventions are being stopped, except for those providing comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is labored, and oxygen therapy is being provided. However, intubation is not planned, which may lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and further transfusions are being withheld. This may lead to worsening anemia and coagulopathy.
3. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and lactulose may be considered to manage mental status and interact with family.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's HD is being discontinued, which may lead to worsening electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is not being supported, which may lead to worsening of symptoms.
6. Pain Control: The patient's pain is being managed with lidocaine patches and IV morphine, but may worsen as the patient's condition deteriorates.
7. Infection: The patient's MSSA bacteremia is being treated, but the patient's immune system is compromised, increasing the risk of secondary infections.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's bleeding may worsen, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and worsening of cardiac function may lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
10. Kidney Failure: The patient's HD is being discontinued, and the patient's kidney function is likely to deteriorate further, leading to worsening electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload."

* Plt: 108-89 K/uL
* Cr: 2.8-2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 96-185 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 20.3/42.5/1.9, ALT/AST: 25/73, Alk Phos/T Bili: 146/24.9, Fibrinogen: 302 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory Distress: Continue nebs PRN and oxygen PRN, but do not intubate.
* Continued Bleeding: Dressing changes PRN, no further transfusions, and trending Hct and plts.
* Low-grade Temps, Leukocytosis: No longer trending labs or imaging, and off antibiotics.
* Worsening Liver Failure: Patient not a transplant candidate, consider lactulose PRN if helpful for mental status and interaction with family.
* ESRD on HD: No further HD.
* Adrenal insufficiency: No further medications.
* Pain control: Patient currently reporting minimal pain, lidocaine patch, and IV morphine (consider drip if pain worsens).

The patient's code status is Comfort Measures Only, and the plan is to transfer the patient to the hospital ward for further care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's continued bleeding may lead to further complications, such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or bleeding into vital organs.
* Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of MSSA bacteremia make them susceptible to further infections.
* Liver failure: The patient's worsening liver failure may lead to further complications, such as encephalopathy, ascites, or bleeding.
* Kidney failure: The patient's ESRD on HD may worsen, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or uremic syndrome.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may worsen, leading to further complications, such as hypotension, hyponatremia, or electrolyte imbalances.
* Pain management: The patient's pain may not be adequately controlled, leading to further complications, such as anxiety, depression, or sleep disturbances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis. Patient failed to
   respond appropriately to transfusions yesterday and has had continued
   bleeding. Family meeting led by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] resulted in decision to make
   patient CMO.
   1. Respiratory Distress: Breathing appears labored but patient
   generally denies subjective SOB.
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Oxygen PRN (will not intubate)
   2. Continued Bleeding: Dressing changes PRN. Patient continues to ooze.
   - No further transfusions
   - Not trending Hct, plts
   - Lidocaine patch to site of thoracentesis for pain control
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis:
   - No longer trending labs or imaging
   - Off antibiotics
   4. Worsening Liver Failure: Patient not a transplant candidate.
   - Consider lactulose PRN if helpful for mental status, interaction with
   family
   5. ESRD on HD:
   - No further HD
   6. Adrenal insufficiency:
   - No further medications
   7. Pain control: Patient currently reporting minimal pain.
   - Lidocaine patch as above
   - IV morphine (consider drip if pain worsens)
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes with HD, diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen lactulose  (hold for diarrhea)
   -Pain management with home regimen of oxycodone
   -PPI
   # Access: PICC line, HD catheter
   # Code: DNR but OK to intubate (family wants time to be at bedside)
   # Communication: Patient; family meeting today at 1300 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   # Emergency Contact:  Father: [**Name (NI) 8405**] [**Name (NI) 8404**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12491**]
   # Disposition: Plan to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 10 this morning

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a complex medical history, including biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and pericardial window. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, bleeding, and liver failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 102 bpm (100-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg (67/41-133/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (14-32 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 92%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.6
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 108
* Creatinine: 2.8
* Glucose: 96
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 20.3 / 42.5 / 1.9, ALT / AST: 25 / 73, Alk Phos / TBili: 146 / 24.9, Fibrinogen: 302 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.9 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for labored breathing, bleeding, and low-grade temperatures.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Comfort measures only (CMO)
* No further transfusions
* No further antibiotics
* Lidocaine patch for pain control
* IV morphine for pain control
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* No further HD
* No further medications for adrenal insufficiency
* Consider lactulose PRN for mental status and interaction with family

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory distress
* Bleeding complications due to ongoing bleeding and low platelet count
* Liver failure due to worsening liver function and lack of transplant candidacy
* Electrolyte imbalance due to ongoing fluid loss and HD
* Infection due to ongoing bacteremia and lack of antibiotics
* Pain management issues due to ongoing pain and limited medication options

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as needed to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's comfort and safety."
