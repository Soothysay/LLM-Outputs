   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
   # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be sicker.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up from
   sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever process is going on.  Patient was minimally following commands
   at that time.  During the night, nursing states she was following
   commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation to assess
   mental status. Change to PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of
   presedex today with slower propofol wean to transition without acute
   agitation.
   # Leukocytosis
 Improved today.  Etiology likely meningitis.  UA
   negative. CXR unrevealing for acute infiltrate.
   - Empiric abx as above
   - F/U urine, blood, CSF cultures
   - Monitor fever and WBC trend
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis - Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum and urine
   tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No evidence of
   DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated and this is
   likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease, who presented with headache, mental status changes, and agitation. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of meningitis vs encephalitis, with a likely etiology of bacterial meningitis, possibly caused by Listeria, pneumococcus, or hemophilus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tcurrent 36.8°C (98.3°F), HR 54 bpm, BP 130/77 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Respiratory support: Intubated and ventilated with a CMV/ASSIST mode, Vt 500 mL, RR 18, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 50%.
* Neurological status: Responds to verbal commands, but agitation and delirium are present.
* Laboratory results: WBC 4.5 K/uL, Hct 31.8%, Plt 247 K/uL, Cr 0.8 mg/dL, Glucose 186 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: MRI with/without gado of brain pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and ventilated, and the possibility of extubation is uncertain.
* Meningitis: The patient's condition is critical, and the risk of complications such as sepsis, brain edema, and increased intracranial pressure is high.
* Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to her compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis, and the risk of developing further acidosis is high, especially if lactate levels continue to rise.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to meningitis, but the risk of developing further complications, such as sepsis, is high.
* Steroid-induced complications: The patient is taking steroids for her underlying condition, and the risk of developing complications, such as adrenal insufficiency, is high.
* Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of interstitial lung disease, and the risk of developing pneumonia is high, especially if she is intubated for an extended period.

Based on the patient's current condition and the potential complications that can arise, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue empiric antibiotics for meningitis and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Repeat CSF culture and viral, fungal, and bacterial tests to determine the etiology of the meningitis.
* Consider placing a PPD test to assess the patient's immune status.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Monitor the patient's metabolic status and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Consider placing the patient on a stress ulcer prophylaxis and monitor for signs of bleeding.
* Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
* Consider placing the patient on a DVT prophylaxis and monitor for signs of thrombosis.
* Monitor the patient's delirium and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Consider placing the patient on a PPI to prevent stress ulceration.
* Monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust IVF therapy as needed.
* Consider placing the patient on a stress ulcer prophylaxis and monitor for signs of bleeding.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Monitor the patient's metabolic status and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Consider placing the patient on a DVT prophylaxis and monitor for signs of thrombosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
   # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be sicker.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up from
   sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever process is going on.  Patient was minimally following commands
   at that time.  During the night, nursing states she was following
   commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation to assess
   mental status. Change to PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of
   presedex today with slower propofol wean to transition without acute
   agitation.
   # Leukocytosis
 Improved today.  Etiology likely meningitis.  UA
   negative. CXR unrevealing for acute infiltrate.
   - Empiric abx as above
   - F/U urine, blood, CSF cultures
   - Monitor fever and WBC trend
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis - Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum and urine
   tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No evidence of
   DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated and this is
   likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease who presented with a headache, mental status changes, and agitation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 4.5 K/uL, and a lactate level of 4.8 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis.

The patient's MRI with gadolinium is pending, and the patient is scheduled to undergo a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for further testing.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 130/77 mmHg and a heart rate of 54 beats per minute.

The patient's metabolic status is stable, with a glucose level of 186 mg/dL and a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with the patient responding to commands minimally and exhibiting agitation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued empiric antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis.
2. Monitoring of the patient's neurological status and respiratory status.
3. Further testing, including a lumbar puncture and MRI with gadolinium.
4. Monitoring of the patient's metabolic status and hemodynamic status.
5. Weaning of sedation and trial of spontaneous ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's neurological status worsens or if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis if the patient's infection is not properly treated.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and there is a risk of metabolic acidosis if the patient's metabolic status worsens.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is altered, and there is a risk of neurological complications if the patient's meningitis is not properly treated.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's interstitial lung disease is a risk factor for pulmonary complications, including respiratory failure and pneumothorax."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
   # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be more sick.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed bolus.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up
   from sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever underlying process is ongoing.  Patient was minimally
   following commands at that time.  During the night, nursing states she
   was following commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation (propofol) to
   assess mental status. Fentanyl/ativan boluses prn agitation.  Change to
   PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of presedex today with slower
   propofol wean to transition without acute agitation if weaning propofol
   alone with boluses is unsuccessful.
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids as above
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis
 Resolved. Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum
   and urine tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No
   evidence of DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated
   and this was likely cause.
   - IVFs
   - Repeat lactate trending down
   - Recheck lactate today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental status changes, and agitation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral culture is pending. The patient's CSF findings are consistent with meningitis or encephalitis, and the most likely etiology is bacterial rather than viral. Listeria is the highest differential diagnosis, given the patient's prodrome and likely deficient cell-mediated immunity due to chronic prednisone use.

The patient is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for pneumococcus, staph species, and Listeria, respectively. The patient is also receiving high-dose steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency and meningitis.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and the patient is receiving 50% fraction of inspired oxygen.

The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, and the anion gap is 25. The patient's lactate level is trending down, and the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's medical history is significant for mixed connective tissue disorder and interstitial lung disease, and the patient has a history of steroid use. The patient's current medications include prednisone, which has been tapered over the last few months.

The patient's neurological status is compromised, with altered mental status, agitation, and inability to follow commands. The patient is receiving sedation with propofol and versed boluses for agitation.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Meningitis or encephalitis due to bacterial or viral infection.
2. Respiratory failure due to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Metabolic acidosis due to lactate elevation.
4. Steroid-induced side effects, such as adrenal insufficiency and osteoporosis.
5. Infection due to Listeria or other bacterial pathogens.
6. Delirium or agitation due to sedation and intubation.
7. Complications of chronic steroid use, such as cataracts and glaucoma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Empirical antibiotic treatment for meningitis or encephalitis.
2. High-dose steroid treatment for relative adrenal insufficiency and meningitis.
3. Sedation with propofol and versed boluses for agitation.
4. Monitoring of lactate levels and glucose control.
5. Intensive care unit (ICU) care, including mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of vital signs.
6. Consideration of MRI with/without gadolinium of the brain to rule out other causes of meningitis or encephalitis.
7. F/u with rheumatology and pulmonary as outpatient as planned."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with MCTD, IPF, and meningitis/encephalitis, requiring mechanical ventilation for airway protection due to severe agitation. She has been sedated with propofol and has not been weaned due to the need for MRI head. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/86 mmHg. She has a normal SpO2 and is receiving fluid support. Laboratory results show a WBC count of 4.5 K/uL, Hct of 31.8%, and Cr of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's condition is complicated by the possibility of viral or bacterial meningitis, with a broad differential diagnosis including HSV encephalitis, Listeria meningoencephalitis, meningococcal, Hflu meningitis, and fungal infections. She is receiving empiric antibiotics and is at high risk for severe respiratory failure and ventilator-associated complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not promptly recognized and treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at high risk for severe respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Ventilator-Associated Complications: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be life-threatening.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can worsen if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying conditions and the use of invasive devices, such as central lines and ventilators.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal system is at risk for complications, such as stress ulceration, due to the use of corticosteroids and other medications.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological condition is complicated by the possibility of HSV encephalitis, Listeria meningoencephalitis, and other neurological complications, which can lead to long-term disability or death."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 25 y.o.f. with h/o mixed connective tissue disorder
   and interstitial lung disease who presented with headache, mental
   status changes, and agitation.
    # MS changes
 Most likely etiology is meningitis vs encephalitis (HA,
   but altered MS making either a possibility) in the setting of symptoms,
   leukocytosis, and CSF findings.  Tox screen negative and no history of
   illicits.  Etiology of meningitis unclear at this point (gram stain
   unrevealing), but likely bacterial rather than viral, although both
   possible.  Listeria highest on differential at this point given
   prodrome and likely deficient cell mediated immunity in setting of
   chronic prednisone.  Does not appear to be meningococcus as no rash and
   would be more sick.  Pneumococcal, hemophilus possible.  Also must
   consider staph and GNR, but no recent surgery or advanced medical
   illness.   Given prednisone must also consider cryptococcus.  Could
   also consider EEE, west [**Doctor First Name 1871**], and [**Location (un) 2390**] encephalitis, although
   season may not be consistent.
   - Treat empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin for
   pneumococcus, staph species, and listeria, respectively
   - Treat with HD steroids both for relative adrenal insufficiency and
   for meningitis
   - Empiric acyclovir for possible HSV
   - F/U CSF culture  - viral, fungal, bacterial -> gram stain negative,
   no cryptococcal antigen detected
   - F/U HSV PCR
   - F/U blood cultures
   - Consider EEE and west [**Doctor First Name 1871**] PCR on CSF, per ID, too early in the year
   but still a consideration
   - Based on records, patient does not appear to have a recent PPD, will
   consider placing today given chronic steroid use
   - C3 and C4 within normal limits
   - Cryoglobulins pending
   - MRI with/without gado of brain per ID today
   # Respiratory Failure
 Intubation for airway protection in the setting
   of meningitis.  Will likely be able to be extubated quickly, but would
   keep intubated until antibiotics can take effect and improve
   MS/agitation.  Patient started on presedex for sedation/analgesia and
   patient became very agitated. Required resedation with propofol and
   versed bolus.  Difficult to assess if agitation was due to waking up
   from sedation intubated, or if this represented continued delirium [**2-10**]
   whatever underlying process is ongoing.  Patient was minimally
   following commands at that time.  During the night, nursing states she
   was following commands briefly.
   - Keep patient intubated today until after MRI (will determine at what
   time it should occur)
   - Continue AC for now, will attempt to lighten sedation (propofol) to
   assess mental status. Fentanyl/ativan boluses prn agitation.  Change to
   PSV if able.  Can consider longer trial of presedex today with slower
   propofol wean to transition without acute agitation if weaning propofol
   alone with boluses is unsuccessful.
   # ILD
 Due to MCTD.   Improved on steroids and these have been tapered
   over the last few months.  Last PFTs stable when compared to prior.
   Prednisone decreased to 10 mg daily in [**3-17**]. Stopped atovaquone for PCP
   px on [**4-23**].  Plan was for rheumatology f/u and if inflammatory markers
   decreased, decrease prednisone to QOD for 2-3 months.  Currently
   stable.
   - Steroids as above
   - F/U with pulmonary as outpatient as planned
   # Metabolic acidosis
 Resolved. Anion gap of 25 on admission.  Serum
   and urine tox screens negative.  No osm gap.  No renal failure.  No
   evidence of DKA as no glucose or ketones in urine.  Lactate elevated
   and this was likely cause.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old with mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) and pulmonary interstitial disease who presented with meningitis and mental status changes. The patient was intubated for airway protection and is currently being treated empirically with antibiotics for possible bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/87 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device, ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 9.4 K/uL, and a platelet count of 269 K/uL. The patient's serum creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen is 10 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for MCTD, interstitial lung disease, and chronic steroid use. The patient has a history of steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency and is currently being treated with high-dose steroids.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Meningitis: The patient is at risk for developing meningitis due to the presence of bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient's CSF culture is pending, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to the presence of pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient is at risk for developing metabolic acidosis due to the presence of lactic acidosis and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is at risk for developing adrenal insufficiency due to the presence of chronic steroid use and the need for high-dose steroids.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the presence of chronic steroid use and the need for immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for meningitis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's adrenal function closely and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider placing the patient on stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the presence of chronic steroid use.
6. Consider placing the patient on DVT prophylaxis due to the presence of chronic steroid use.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD) and pulmonary interstitial disease (ILD) who presented with meningitis, encephalitis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been empirically treated with antibiotics and antivirals, and has undergone various diagnostic tests, including CSF cultures, MRI, and blood tests.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* Heart rate: 55 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 145/87 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* CTA bilaterally in the lungs
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* No edema in the extremities
* A/O x 3, with no meningismus
* Moves all extremities, with grossly intact cranial nerves II-XII

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 4.5-9.4 K/uL
* Hct: 31.1-31.8%
* Plt: 247-269 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 125-186 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continuing treatment for meningitis/encephalitis with empiric antibiotics and antivirals
* Monitoring for respiratory failure and adjusting oxygen therapy as needed
* Managing ILD with steroids and pulmonology follow-up as an outpatient
* Monitoring for metabolic acidosis and adjusting treatment as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure, requiring reintubation or non-invasive ventilation
* Meningitis/encephalitis, leading to increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or brain herniation
* Sepsis or septic shock, requiring vasopressors and other supportive care
* Metabolic acidosis, leading to organ dysfunction or failure
* ILD, requiring adjustment of treatment and close monitoring for worsening lung function
* DVT or VAP, requiring prophylactic treatment and close monitoring for signs of infection.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with history of MCTD and admit with mental status changes
   and positive LP. She has now had improved mental status and stability
   of ventilatory support.  Unifying diagnosis still remains to be defined
   but viral source of meningitis may well be at play--differential is
   obviously more extensive than that and empiric coverage is in place.  I
   would add the temporal lobe focus of seizure would be reasonable to
   consider as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure
with mental status improved she has tolerated
   extubation.
   -On room air
   -OOB to ambulate today
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -CNS infection possible and suggested by increased WBC count
   -Continue with Acyclovir/Amp/CTX/Vanco
   -Appreciate ID support and input.
   -Await final cultures
   -Dexamethasone to continue given MRI findings but with clinical
   improvement may be able to consider D/C and certainly at 4 days.

   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with history of MCTD and admit with mental status changes
   and positive LP. She has now had improved mental status and stability
   of ventilatory support.  Unifying diagnosis still remains to be defined
   but viral source of meningitis may well be at play--differential is
   obviously more extensive than that and empiric coverage is in place.  I
   would add the temporal lobe focus of seizure would be reasonable to
   consider as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure
with mental status improved she has tolerated
   extubation.
   -On room air
   -OOB to ambulate today
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -CNS infection possible and suggested by increased WBC count
   -Continue with Acyclovir/Amp/CTX/Vanco
   -Appreciate ID support and input.
   -Await final cultures
   -Dexamethasone to continue given MRI findings but with clinical
   improvement may be able to consider D/C and certainly at 4 days.
   3)ICU-
   -Full code
   -To floor today

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) who was admitted with mental status changes and positive lumbar puncture (LP). She has now had improved mental status and stability of ventilatory support.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has tolerated extubation and is breathing on room air. She is expected to ambulate today.
* Mental Status: Her mental status has improved, but she is still experiencing altered mental status, which may be related to a CNS infection, as suggested by the increased WBC count.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiovascular system appears to be stable, with a normal PMI, S1, and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs.
* Respiratory/Chest: The patient's lung expansion is symmetric, and percussion is resonant. Breath sounds are diminished.
* Abdominal: The patient's abdomen is soft.
* Extremities: The patient's right extremity has absent pulses, while the left extremity has trace pulses.
* Skin: The patient's skin was not assessed.
* Neurologic: The patient follows simple commands, but her movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count: 4.5 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 247 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen: 135 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium: 142 mEq/L, Potassium: 107 mEq/L, Chloride: 99 mEq/L
* Glucose: 186 mg/dL
* Other labs: Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL, Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL, Phosphate: 2.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Meningitis or other CNS infections, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Sepsis and multi-organ failure due to the patient's underlying MCTD and potential infections
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis
* Neurologic complications, such as seizures, due to the patient's underlying MCTD and potential CNS infections
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting, due to the patient's underlying MCTD and potential infections
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, due to the patient's underlying MCTD and potential infections
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, due to the patient's underlying MCTD and potential infections."
