You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and found to have left lung collapse. The patient had a PEA arrest and responded to epinephrine and atropine.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 133 bpm
* Blood pressure: 86/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, rate of 10 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 100%. She is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, phenylephrine, and amiodarone infusions.

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 21.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 644 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is likely worsening in the setting of hypoxia and levophed use. She is being treated with amiodarone and neosynephrine.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adjustment of her ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of levophed and amiodarone increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and adjustment of her medication regimen are necessary.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and low hemoglobin levels increase her risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and transfusion of blood products as necessary are necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and respiratory failure increase her risk of developing an infection. Close monitoring of her temperature and respiratory status, and treatment of any underlying infections, are necessary.
5. Hydronephrosis: The patient's poorly placed R ureteral stent increases her risk of developing hydronephrosis. Close monitoring of her renal function and adjustment of her stent placement are necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue invasive ventilation with adjustments to tidal volume, rate, and FiO2 as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
3. Transfuse blood products as necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level of >25.
4. Treat any underlying infections and monitor the patient's temperature and respiratory status.
5. Adjust the patient's stent placement to prevent hydronephrosis.
6. Consider bronchoscopy to evaluate for bleeding related to the lung mass.
7. Consider stress dose steroids with hydrocortisone to treat adrenal insufficiency.
8. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   .
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   .
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   .
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   .
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet
   .
   # Access - Femoral line, R art line
   .
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   .
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and found to have left lung collapse. The patient had a PEA arrest and was resuscitated with epinephrine and atropine.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, rate of 24, and FiO2 of 50%. She has a fever of 101.2°F and is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's left lung collapse and respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's recent PEA arrest and continued requirement for pressors may indicate ongoing cardiac instability.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient's history of hemoptysis and recent bronchoscopy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.8 g/dL, which may indicate anemia, particularly given her history of metastatic cancer and recent bleeding complications.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen in the setting of hypoxia and levophed use, which could increase the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Hydronephrosis: The patient's poorly placed right ureteral stent may increase the risk of hydronephrosis and urinary tract infections.
8. COPD: The patient's history of COPD may worsen in the setting of respiratory failure and increased respiratory rate.
9. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen in the setting of hypovolemia and vasopressor use.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of malnutrition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Repeat ABG post-bronchoscopy and reassessment of respiratory status.
2. Consultation with Rad Onc for possible further management of the patient's lung mass.
3. Coverage for possible post-obstructive pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
4. Continue invasive ventilation with adjustments based on repeat ABG results.
5. Consider R main stem intubation if the patient develops hemoptysis overnight.
6. ENT evaluation post-extubation given vocal cord trauma.
7. Replete electrolytes, check ionized calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels.
8. Treat underlying cause of PEA arrest, including sepsis and cardiac instability.
9. Continue neosynephrine for blood pressure support.
10. Monitor for signs of autopeep and adjust ventilation accordingly.
11. Hold outpatient medications for hypertension and COPD until further evaluation.
12. Monitor for signs of malnutrition and provide nutrition support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including invasive ventilation, multi-lumen placement, arterial line insertion, and rigid bronchoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 2,759 mL and a total fluid output of 405 mL, with a net fluid balance of 2,354 mL.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 21.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.7%
* Platelet count: 644 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has been prescribed various medications, including antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin), sedatives (Midazolam and Fentanyl), and anti-arrhythmic medication (Amiodarone).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is receiving anti-arrhythmic medication, and there is a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, and there is a risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock.
6. Infection: The patient has been prescribed antibiotics, and there is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through various means, and there is a risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to impaired wound healing and increased risk of infection.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal patient outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 400 x 10,
   PIP 24, and last gas with quite hypercarbia- since she has COPFD and is
   one lung vented ? autoPEEP and created Zone 1 lung. We will try smaller
   volume and slightly faster rate. Place A line for frequent ABGs and
   hemodynamics. If she bleeds needs left lung down, advance ETT into
   right mainstem and alert IP for urgent intervention. Could also try
   endobronchial blocker. We will cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post
   obstructive PNA esp with plans for intervention in AM.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   to be done. Cycle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks
   benefits can be assessed.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Will check stat
   head CT to look for blled (known mets). Serail Neuro exams throughout
   evening
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on

 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   to be done. Cycle CKs.
   3.       Anemia: source of blood loss unclear, not GI source, Abd CT
   neg for RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss though
   not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once rigid bronch done and risks

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who presents with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 81 bpm (tachycardic)
* Blood pressure: 106/53 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving fluids and vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-65 mmHg.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory distress due to left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The plan is to try smaller volumes and a slightly faster rate, and to place an arterial line for frequent ABGs and hemodynamics.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced cardiac arrest, which was resolved with brief epinephrine, atropine, and CPR. She is currently receiving norepinephrine and is being weaned off the medication. A formal echocardiogram is planned to assess cardiac function.
3. Anemia: The source of blood loss is unclear, but it is not gastrointestinal. The patient may have blood in her chest as the source of loss, although this is not overt hemoptysis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a likely coagulopathy, which is being held acutely due to her recent cardiac arrest. The plan is to re-evaluate the need for anticoagulation once the patient's cardiac function is stable.
5. Neurological issues: The patient has had a short downtime after her cardiac arrest and is at risk for neurologic sequelae. A stat head CT is planned to assess for any bleeding or other neurologic abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 21.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 644 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 103 mg/dL
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute
* Vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-65 mmHg
* Arterial line for frequent ABGs and hemodynamics
* Norepinephrine to be weaned off
* Formal echocardiogram to assess cardiac function
* Cycle CKs to assess cardiac enzyme levels
* Stat head CT to assess for any bleeding or other neurologic abnormalities
* Serial neuro exams throughout the evening
* Tube feeds for nutrition
* Glycemic control with insulin as needed
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for further management and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who suffered a hypoxic PEA arrest and was intubated in the ICU. She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy to clear a clot from her left mainstem bronchus, but was unable to place a stent.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure due to left lung collapse and possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PIP of 29 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%, and her oxygenation is acceptable.

The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, as she experienced a cardiac arrest that was resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR. She is currently on neostigmine and is being weaned off, with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60-65 mmHg and a maintenance urine output (UOP) of 30 cc/hr.

The patient's anemia is stable, and her hemoglobin (Hb) level is 11.8 g/dL. Her platelet count is 644 K/uL, and her white blood cell (WBC) count is 21.6 K/uL.

The patient's neuro status is also a concern, as she experienced a short downtime following her arrest. A preliminary head CT scan showed no bleed, and her neuro status is stable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, with a value of 0.9 mmol/L. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 3.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include midazolam, fentanyl, amiodarone, and vancomycin, as well as famotidine and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to left lung collapse and possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus.
2. Cardiac arrest: due to hypoxemia and bradycardia.
3. Anemia: due to ongoing bleeding or blood loss.
4. Neurological complications: due to post-arrest short downtime and abnormal laboratory results.
5. Infection: due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation with a PIP of 29 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
2. Weaning off neostigmine and adjusting her MAP to 60-65 mmHg.
3. Monitoring her urine output and adjusting her fluid management accordingly.
4. Repeat head CT scan to rule out any intracranial bleeding.
5. Echocardiogram to assess her cardiac function.
6. Regular laboratory monitoring to assess her electrolyte and lactate levels.
7. Antibiotic coverage for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
8. Consultation with radiology and radiation oncology to discuss the role of salvage radiation therapy.

The patient's disposition is ICU, and she is expected to remain critically ill for the foreseeable future."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and L lung collapse.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse with improved aeration s/p debridement. Pt with known left
   hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, now with
   collapse. Had rigid bronch yesterday but unable to stent LMS. Has had
   increased aeration since bronch by CXR. Tidal volume increased
   overnight with improved ABGs
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess, may have improved respirataory
   status after thoracentesis
   - Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn, F/U cx
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, Pressure support trials.  Will
   alter based on repeat ABGs
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   - Lasix 40 IV given for possibility of fluid overload contributing to
   respiratory distress and +multiple liters over hospital course
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - CE neg x 2
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt still requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Likely
   cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] with component of sepsis given hypokinetic dilated RV
   on Echo. Extremities clamped down. PE also possible given
   hypercoagulable state with malignancy, h/o [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]. Diagnosing PE,
   however, would not change management since needs anticoagulation anyway
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - monitor on telemetry
   - will attempt to diurese to optimize fluid status by starting lasix
   drip, following Is and Os
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   Rad Onc consulted and will follow. No treatment recommended at this
   time
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
 Will restart Lovenox tonight  given risk of having [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**] +/- PE and need to anticoagulate. We will resite line today
   and she had bronch and thoracentesis so ok to restart this evening
   - restart lovenox tonight
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use
 now on neosynephrine. Off amio drip and will change to
   amio 400 mg PO BID (equivalent dose to what she received IV)
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - will restart anticoag
   - AMio 400 PO BID
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN
 Started TF
   # Access - Femoral line, will resite
   # Code

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and L lung collapse.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse with improved aeration s/p debridement. Pt with known left
   hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, now with
   collapse. Had rigid bronch yesterday but unable to stent LMS. Has had
   increased aeration since bronch by CXR. Tidal volume increased
   overnight with improved ABGs
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess, may have improved respirataory
   status after thoracentesis
   - Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn, F/U cx
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, Pressure support trials.  Will
   alter based on repeat ABGs
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   - Lasix 40 IV given for possibility of fluid overload contributing to
   respiratory distress and +multiple liters over hospital course
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - CE neg x 2
   - Replete lytes prn
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt still requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Likely
   cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] with component of sepsis given hypokinetic dilated RV
   on Echo. Extremities clamped down. PE also possible given
   hypercoagulable state with malignancy, h/o [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]. Diagnosing PE,
   however, would not change management since needs anticoagulation anyway
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - monitor on telemetry
   - will attempt to diurese to optimize fluid status by starting lasix
   drip, following Is and Os
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   Rad Onc consulted and will follow. No treatment recommended at this
   time
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
 Will restart Lovenox tonight  given risk of having [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**] +/- PE and need to anticoagulate. We will resite line today
   and she had bronch and thoracentesis so ok to restart this evening
   - restart lovenox tonight
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use
 now on neosynephrine. Off amio drip and will change to
   amio 400 mg PO BID (equivalent dose to what she received IV)
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - will restart anticoag
   - AMio 400 PO BID
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and later developed a PEA arrest. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, debridement, and thoracentesis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is still intubated and on invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has improved aeration since the bronchoscopy and thoracentesis, with a tidal volume increased overnight. Her ABGs are stable, with a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PO2 of 180 mmHg.
* Cardiac: The patient has a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function, and is on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is likely worsening due to hypoxia and levophed use.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 108/103 mmHg, with a heart rate of 79 beats per minute. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is not mentioned, but she is on vasopressors.
* Renal: The patient has hydronephrosis, with a poorly placed right ureteral stent. She is on diuretics to optimize fluid status.
* Coagulation: The patient has a hypercoagulable state due to her malignancy, and is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism (PE).
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (HCT) level has dropped to 20% from her baseline of 30-34%, with an unclear etiology. She is being transfused to maintain an HCT level of 25%.
* Infection: The patient has a moderate growth of OP flora in her sputum culture, and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require further interventions to improve her oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of PEA arrest, and is at risk of developing further cardiac arrests due to her underlying cardiac condition and hypoxia.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypercoagulable state and history of malignancy make her at risk of developing PE, which could be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly.
* Sepsis: The patient's underlying infection and hypercoagulable state make her at risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further cardiac compromise and increased risk of bleeding.
* Hydronephrosis: The patient's hydronephrosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple underlying conditions that require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and echocardiogram (ECHO) in the morning. The ECHO showed a dilated right ventricle with borderline normal function, which is an improvement compared to the previous study. The patient was weaned off pressors and the radiation therapy was deemed ineffective. The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, codeine, and unknown. The patient received antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is being treated with various medications, including midazolam, amiodarone, phenylephrine, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/103 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show normal ranges for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The liver function tests are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 168 mg/dL and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 34.9%. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no cardiac damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient is still receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 180, which is within the normal range.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's right ventricle is dilated, which may indicate cardiac failure. The patient's troponin-T level is normal, indicating no cardiac damage.
3. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. The patient's liver function tests are slightly elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's platelet count is normal, but the patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low. The patient's bleeding time is not assessed.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the patient's underlying medical condition.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the patient's underlying medical condition.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is being managed with a pulmonary nutrition supplement, but the patient may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to the patient's underlying medical condition and the patient's inability to eat.
9. Medication errors: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and the patient may be at risk for medication errors due to the complexity of the patient's medication regimen."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet
   # Access - Femoral line, R art line
   # Code - Full
   .
   # Dispo - ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 63y.o. F with a PMH of metastatic non small cell Lung CA admitted
   with acute respiratory distress now s/p PEA arrest and found to have L
   lung collapse.
   .# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - Pt found to have L lung
   collapse. Pt with known left hilar lung mass with encasement of the
   left-sided bronchi, now with collapse. Had rigid bronch this am but
   unable to stent LMS. Has had increased aeration since bronch by CXR.
   Tidal volume decreased, RR increased overnight since essentially single
   lung ventilation given LL collapse. W
   - Repeat ABg post bronch and reassess
   - consult Rad Onc for possible further management
   -  Will cover for possible post-obstructive PNA with Vanc/Zosyn
   - Continue invasive ventilation with AC, TV 350, Rate 24, FIO2 50%.
   Will alter based on repeat ABG after debridement
   - If pt has hemoptysis overnight, protect R lung with positioning
   patient L side down, consider R main stem intubation
   - Will need ENT eval post extubation given vocal cord trauma
   .
   # S/P PEA Arrest - PEA arrest in the setting of respiratory failure and
   hypovolemia. Responded to epi and atropine
   - Cycle CE
   - Replete lytes, check ionized Ca, K and Mg
   - Treat underlying cause as above
   - CT Head negative for bleed and ischemia. Consider head MRI once
   stable.
   # [**Name (NI) 1531**] - Pt requiring pressors s/p PEA arrest. Extremities clamped
   down. Likely septic vs cardiogenic [**Name (NI) **] since still requiring
   pressors. Septic [**Name (NI) **] most likely given fever, likely post obstructive
   PNA. Also consideration of cardiogenic considering PEA arrest.
   - continue neo for goal MAP>60, avoid levophed given rapid AF in ED
   - cycle CE and monitor on telemetry
   - TTE to assess WMA, thrombus
   - Transfuse for HCT>25
   - Given pt recently completed course of dexamethasone for brain met
   will give stress dose steroids with hydrocort 50 Q8
   .
   # Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Ca - metastatic to right adrenal and
   cerebellum, s/p cyber knife therapy.  Treatment of lung mass as above.
   .
   # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] - holding Lovenox overnight given low HCT, repeat TTE
   today, will restart in am
   # Anemia - HCT drop to 20 from baseline (30-34) of unclear etiology. CT
   Abd and Pelvis negative for bleed. Possible hemorrhage related to lung
   CA and L lung collapse. HCT up to 35, stable.
   - keep HCT>25 given cardiac arrest
   - Guaiac stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation - likely worsening in setting of hypoxia and
   levophed use - will switch pressor to neosynephrine
   - holding metoprolol given [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
   - holding lovenox for now since recently had hemoptysis and
   bronchoscopy
   # Hydronephrosis - CT A&P demonstrates poorly placed R ureteral stent -
   outpatient follow up
   # COPD - continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   - monitor vent for evidence of autopeep
   # HTN - holding outpatient meds given hypotension
   # FEN - NPO for now. If ABG worse, cannot tolerate PSV, will place OGT
   and start TF. If able to be extubated, will restart diet

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted with acute respiratory distress and found to have left lung collapse. She had a pulmonary embolism arrest and responded to epinephrine and atropine. She has been receiving invasive ventilation and has been weaned off pressors. She has a history of left hilar lung mass with encasement of the left-sided bronchi, which is causing the lung collapse.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/103 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.6, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 644.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is being treated with invasive ventilation, and her tidal volume has been decreased to 350 mL. Her rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her FiO2 is 50%.
* S/P PEA arrest: The patient is being treated with vasopressors and has been repleted with electrolytes. She is being monitored for signs of sepsis and cardiogenic shock.
* Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: The patient is being treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin has dropped to 11.5 g/dL, and she is being treated with blood transfusions.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated with antiarrhythmic medications and has been switched to neosynephrine as a pressor.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's lung collapse and hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure increase her risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's history of PEA arrest and her requirement for vasopressors increase her risk of sepsis.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of PEA arrest and her requirement for vasopressors increase her risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can increase her risk of cardiac arrest and other complications.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can increase her risk of cardiac arrest and stroke.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment of her underlying conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,

   IP topday shows [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 1567**] [**Location (un) 1568**] but patent and CXR shows open. [**Female First Name (un) 1569**] by
   IP at bedside to attempt for max expansion of left lung We will cover
   with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Hold off on Rad Onc
   re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Female First Name (un) 1531**]: Cardiac
 RV dysfunction- likely hypoxemic overload and
   possible PA compression with mass, PE also possibility. We are
   anticoagulating.  On we are pursuing diuresis to unload
 Place neck
   CVL for CVp and SCVo2.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer who presented with respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with acceptable oxygenation and ventilation. The patient has a history of anemia, and her hemoglobin level is 11.5 g/dL. She is also experiencing cardiac dysfunction, likely due to hypoxemic overload and possible PA compression with the mass. The patient has been anticoagulated, and diuresis is being pursued to unload the cardiovascular system.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to her underlying lung disease and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction may worsen due to hypoxemic overload, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anemia and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a post-obstructive pneumonia, and the presence of a central line and ventilator increases the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's post-arrest neurological status is uncertain, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration due to hypoxemia, hypotension, and cardiac dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anemia and cardiac dysfunction may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and hypotension may increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's anemia and cardiac dysfunction may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy and diuresis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer, is in the ICU due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She presents with left lung collapse, possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a heart rate of 116 bpm and blood pressure of 107/76 mmHg. She is also anemic, with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, ventilator mode, and oxygen delivery device.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory decline due to left lung collapse and potential post-obstructive blood and/or pus.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has already experienced cardiac arrest, and there is a risk of further cardiac instability due to hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but there is a risk of further blood loss due to possible bleeding from the respiratory or abdominal tract.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has experienced a short downtime after cardiac arrest, and there is a risk of further neurological complications due to post-arrest syndrome.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) due to the presence of post-obstructive blood and/or pus in the left lung.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is unstable, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to the need to hold anticoagulation therapy acutely.
7. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and there is a risk of further fluid imbalance due to the need to maintain a MAP of 60-65 and UOP of 30cc/hr.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to maintain acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust therapy as necessary to maintain a MAP of 60-65 and UOP of 30cc/hr.
3. Consider endobronchial blocker or left lung down to manage post-obstructive blood and/or pus.
4. Wean the patient off Neo and continue to monitor for signs of cardiac instability.
5. Repeat hemoglobin levels and consider transfusion if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further imaging studies to rule out any further neurological complications.
7. Consider antibiotic therapy for possible post-obstructive PNA.
8. Re-evaluate the patient's coagulation status once stable from bleeding standpoint and consider restarting anticoagulation therapy.
9. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust therapy as necessary to maintain a MAP of 60-65 and UOP of 30cc/hr."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yr old woman with Stage IV lung Ca presents with resp arrest,
   cardiac arrest, and hypotension.
   Possible evolution of events was that hemoptysis evolved, clotted off
   left mainstem leading to resp. distress and ultimately arrest from
   hypoxemia.
   Problems
   [**Name (NI) 1531**]
   Respiratory Failure
   Anemia
   1.       Hypoxemic Resp Distress: due to left lung collapse with
   possible post obstructive blood and or pus. Currently on AC 350 x 24,
   PIP 24, and acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.  If she re-bleeds
   needs left lung down, advance ETT into right mainstem and alert IP for
   urgent intervention. Could also try endobronchial blocker. We will
   cover with Vanco Zosyn for possible post obstructive PNA. Will speak
   with Rad Onc re role of salvage XRT.
   2.       [**Name (NI) 1531**]: Cardiac Arrest: seems that she was hypoxemic then
   bradycardic then PEA
 resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR
 currently on
   Neo but weaning off
 goal MAP 60-65, maintain UOP 30cc/hr. Formal Echo
   pending.
   3.       Anemia: repeat Hct actually stable- initial may have been
   spurious. RP or abd bleed, may be blood in chest as source of loss
   though not overt hemoptysis now.
   4.       [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1532**]- likely murantic- we have to hold anti coagulation
   acutely but will need to re evaluate once stable from bleeding
   standpoint.
   5.       Neuro: post arrest- short down time by report. Prelim head CT
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff notes.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old woman with Stage IV lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. She presented with hemoptysis, which evolved into respiratory distress and ultimately arrest due to hypoxemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with acceptable ventilation and oxygenation. The patient has several ongoing issues, including:

1. Respiratory failure due to left lung collapse with possible post-obstructive blood and/or pus.
2. Cardiac arrest, which was resolved with brief epi/atrop/CPR, and the patient is currently on neostigmine but weaning off.
3. Anemia, which is currently stable, but may be due to blood loss from the chest or abdominal bleeding.
4. Bleeding disorder, which is likely to be mucocutaneous, and anti-coagulation needs to be held acutely but will need to be re-evaluated once the patient is stable.
5. Neurological issues, including a short downtime after cardiac arrest, and a preliminary head CT scan showing no significant abnormalities.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia due to post-obstructive blood and/or pus in the left lung.
2. Further bleeding complications due to the patient's bleeding disorder.
3. Worsening of anemia due to continued blood loss.
4. Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiac issues.
5. Neurological complications due to the patient's post-arrest short downtime and potential ongoing neurological issues.

Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with acceptable ventilation and oxygenation.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and wean off neostigmine as tolerated.
3. Repeat Hct to monitor anemia and consider blood transfusions if necessary.
4. Hold anti-coagulation acutely and re-evaluate once the patient is stable.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging if necessary.
6. Speak with Rad Onc about the role of salvage XRT and consider endobronchial blocker or left lung down if the patient re-bleeds.
7. Consider covering the patient with Vanco and Zosyn for possible post-obstructive PNA."
