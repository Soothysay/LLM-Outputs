   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o M w/ no significant PMH presenting with acute posterior flail
   mitral leaflet.
   .
   # Acute Decompensated Heart Failure secondary to Acute Mitral
   Regurgitation, posterior flail leaflet:  Unclear etiology.  Currently
   HD stable, with IABP and no vasoactive agents.  LVEDP 40mmHg at the
   time of cath.  Etiologies can include papillary muscle rupture [**1-11**]
   ischemia (but patient has clean coronaries, so not likely), Acute
   Endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous
   changes.  The patient presented to the OSH with T 100.5F.  Echo at OSH
   reportedly showed no vegetations, however TEE would better assess for
   veggies given suspicion of acute MR.  Acute Staph Endocarditis can lead
   to acute MR given fast degeneration.  For now, will need to cover for
   endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent GI endoscopy
   involving three polypectomies.
   - TEE in AM to evaluate
   - continue diuresis w/o lasix if possible
   - continue vanc/CTX
   - Continue Heparin gtt for IABP thromboembolism prophylaxis
   - Follow MAP > 60; if decreases will plan to start pressors and place
   CVL
   - Contact OSH for BCx
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs; may need dental consult pre-op

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   I have reviewed admission history and physical and cardiac
   catheterization.  Course consistent with acute mitral valve
   regurgitation with pulmonary edema and hypotension. Has had essentialy
   negative coronary angiogram and IABP placement.
   Physical Examination
   Comfortable.
   JVP not elevated.
   [**2-12**] MR murmur.
   CXR: Pulmonary edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Significantly improved hemodynamics on IABP.  Mild hypotension stable
   off pressors. Oxygenation adequateand continues to diurese.  Plan also
   reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1038**] regarding timing of cardiac surgery.  Will
   plan TEE today to help exclude vegetation, although endocarditis seems
   unlikely explanation.  If remains hemodynamically and endocarditis
   unlikely will plan for mitral valve repair tomorrow. Continue IABP
   hemodynamic support.
   Critical care: 30 minutes due to unstable hemodynamics requiring IABP
   management.

   on:[**2173-11-7**] 12:11 PM ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history, who presented with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet and was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. He was admitted to the ICU with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He received vancomycin and ceftriaxone antibiotics, as well as heparin sodium infusion for thromboembolism prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98%. He is receiving non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has a sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, and his chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 182 K/uL. His troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include coverage for endocarditis, gram-positive and gram-negative, given his recent gastrointestinal endoscopy involving three polypectomies. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned for today to evaluate for vegetations, and he will continue to receive diuresis, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone antibiotics. He will also receive heparin infusion for thromboembolism prophylaxis and will be monitored for hypotension and other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient is at risk for developing endocarditis due to his recent gastrointestinal endoscopy and the presence of mitral regurgitation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and he may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury due to his heart failure and diuretic therapy.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of respiratory failure.
4. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for developing thromboembolism due to his mitral regurgitation and the use of heparin infusion for thromboembolism prophylaxis.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection due to his recent gastrointestinal endoscopy and the presence of mitral regurgitation.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus rhythm may change due to his heart failure and the use of diuretic therapy.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure may fluctuate due to his heart failure and the use of diuretic therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history who presented with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet and acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. He is currently hemodynamically stable with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and no vasoactive agents. The etiology of the acute mitral regurgitation is unclear, but possibilities include papillary muscle rupture, ischemia, acute endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous changes. The patient is receiving antibiotic coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is planned to evaluate for vegetations.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask with an oxygen saturation of 98%. He is receiving infusions of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, which is elevated. Close monitoring of kidney function is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has acute endocarditis, which increases the risk of sepsis. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and increased white blood cell count, is essential.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be a compensatory response to the mitral regurgitation. However, close monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, is necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, but close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal endoscopy with polypectomies, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is essential.
6. Infection: The patient has acute endocarditis, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count, is necessary.
7. Thromboembolism: The patient is receiving heparin sodium to prevent thromboembolism. Close monitoring for signs of thromboembolism, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, is necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with no significant prior medical history, who presented with acute posterior flail mitral leaflet and acute decompensated heart failure secondary to acute mitral regurgitation. The etiology of the mitral regurgitation is unclear, but possible causes include papillary muscle rupture, acute endocarditis, or chronic myxomatous changes. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and no vasoactive agents. Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's condition can deteriorate if the mitral regurgitation worsens, leading to further cardiac compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's recent gastrointestinal endoscopy involving three polypectomies increases the risk of endocarditis, which can lead to further cardiac complications and sepsis.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the IABP and potential endocarditis, making them more susceptible to infections.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic status can deteriorate if the IABP is not functioning properly or if there is a sudden change in cardiac output.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if diuresis is not effective, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if there is a sudden change in oxygenation or ventilation, leading to respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status can deteriorate, leading to cardiac arrest if the mitral regurgitation worsens or if there is a sudden change in cardiac rhythm.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will need to undergo further evaluation, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for vegetations and determine the etiology of the mitral regurgitation. The patient will also need to continue diuresis without Lasix if possible, and will require continued coverage for endocarditis with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient will also need to be monitored for signs of infection, hemodynamic instability, and respiratory complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Endocarditis (most likely secondary to Staph), or chronic myxomatous
   changes.  The patient presented to the OSH with T 100.5F.  Echo at OSH
   reportedly showed no vegetations, however TEE would better assess for
   veggies given suspicion of acute MR.  Acute Staph Endocarditis can lead
   to acute MR given fast degeneration.  For now, will need to cover for
   endocarditis, gram + and gram negatives given recent GI endoscopy
   involving three polypectomies.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-inch tall, 80 kg individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation, and a TEE examination revealed a partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range: 81-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 93/69 mmHg (normal range: 75/50-110/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-30 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals a hyperdynamic cardiac examination with a non-displaced PMI and no thrills or lifts. The lungs are clear, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Serum electrolytes: Na+ 139 mEq/L, K+ 4.0 mEq/L, Cl- 104 mEq/L, HCO3- 22 mg/dL

The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, midazolam, fentanyl, and lasix.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade due to the severe mitral regurgitation.
2. Pulmonary edema due to the cardiac condition.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's underlying condition and potential bacterial infections.
4. Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.
5. Renal failure due to the patient's creatinine level and potential electrolyte imbalances.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to the patient's lasix therapy.
7. Bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and potential platelet dysfunction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their condition:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation and flail of the posterior mitral leaflet. They have undergone various medical interventions, including diuresis with IV lasix, infusion of heparin sodium, and administration of antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 93/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. They are receiving oxygen therapy via a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals a hyperdynamic cardiac exam with a non-displaced PMI, loud S2, and holosystolic murmur. They have diffuse rales in all lung fields and a soft, non-tender abdomen.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 34.0%
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 8.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactate dehydrogenase: 187 IU/L

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening mitral regurgitation, leading to heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
2. Development of atrial fibrillation or flutter due to the underlying cardiac condition.
3. Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential fluid overload.
4. Infection, particularly endocarditis, given the patient's underlying cardiac condition and the presence of a foreign body (IABP line).
5. Hemodynamic instability, particularly if the patient's cardiac function worsens or if there is a significant change in their fluid status.
6. Renal dysfunction or failure, given the patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential fluid overload.
7. Thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, given the patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential bleeding risks.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
