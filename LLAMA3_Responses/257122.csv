   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 142 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has atrial flutter, with a rate of 110-120 bpm, and is still tachycardic despite diltiazem boluses.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-appearing, with moderate expiratory wheezes bilaterally throughout lung fields, and no murmurs.
* Labs/Radiology: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests, with a PT/PTT/INR of 15.9/45.1/1.4, and an elevated troponin level.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Thromboembolism: Given the patient's atrial flutter and CHADS2 score of 2, there is a high risk of thromboembolism with cardioversion.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter can worsen and lead to more serious arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
* Heart failure: The patient's tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy can worsen and lead to heart failure, with symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and edema.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's wheezing can worsen and lead to respiratory failure, with symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and cyanosis.
* Infection: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an underlying infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Electrical cardioversion and ablation to treat atrial flutter and prevent recurrent episodes.
* Warfarin therapy to prevent thromboembolism.
* Diltiazem therapy to control heart rate.
* Heparin therapy to bridge to warfarin therapy.
* TEE to assess for clot in the left atrium.
* I/O goal of -1L to manage fluid overload.
* Lasix therapy to manage fluid overload.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, and to improve his cardiac function and overall health."

Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial flutter and heart failure. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has been tachycardic with a heart rate of 142-148 bpm. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium and diltiazem infusions, as well as other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted atrial flutter and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may lead to complications such as:
	* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
	* Atrial fibrillation
	* Cardiac arrhythmias
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may lead to complications such as:
	* Pulmonary edema
	* Respiratory failure
	* Cardiac arrest
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg may indicate hypotension, which can lead to:
	* Organ dysfunction
	* Shock
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may lead to:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias
	* Cardiac failure
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.4 and PTT of 45.1 seconds may indicate coagulopathy, which can lead to:
	* Bleeding complications
	* Increased risk of infection
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's lack of oral intake may lead to:
	* Malnutrition
	* Dehydration
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's ICU stay may lead to stress ulcer development, which can cause:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding
	* Sepsis
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP, which can lead to:
	* Pneumonia
	* Sepsis
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and coagulopathy may increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to:
	* Pulmonary embolism
	* Post-thrombotic syndrome

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge

   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**2-23**], wish is 4%.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. Other etiologies,
   such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less likely
   given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse. Either
   way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his
   cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely improved
   after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has diuresed
   about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid overloaded
   as evidenced by moderate pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   overnight should be even to slightly (500 cc) negative, but there is no
   need at this time to aggressively diuresed as his fluid overload should
   get better after tomorrow
s procedure. Rate control should be enough
   for him for now to control his symptoms.
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   -          I/O goal net even to slightly (500 cc) negative
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation tomorrow should
   improve his LV function
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG. He is on an
   aspirin for unclear reason. We will hold the ASA for now.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: cardiac diet, NPO for TEE after midnight
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace
   # CODE: full
   # DISPO: CCU for now
   # CONTACT: wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6069**]
   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**2-23**], wish is 4%.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He was transferred from another hospital for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, with a heart rate of 142 beats per minute, and has been treated with diltiazem. He also has moderate expiratory wheezes bilaterally and is at risk for COPD. The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and he requires electrical cardioversion and ablation to reverse his atrial flutter. The patient's labs show elevated glucose levels, and he requires insulin sliding scale therapy. He also has a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and his blood pressure is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thromboembolism: The patient's atrial flutter and CHADS2 score of 4% increase the risk of thromboembolism. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to assess for clot in the left atrium before electrical cardioversion and ablation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's wheezing and risk of COPD may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may convert to atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia increases the risk of sepsis, especially if he develops an infection.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin sliding scale therapy may lead to hypoglycemia if not monitored closely.
6. Bleeding: The patient's heparin therapy increases the risk of bleeding, especially if his INR is not monitored closely.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of diabetes and hypertension increases the risk of renal failure, especially if he develops acute kidney injury.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will undergo a TEE to assess for clot in the left atrium before electrical cardioversion and ablation. He will also receive insulin sliding scale therapy to manage his blood sugar levels. His heparin therapy will be continued to prevent thromboembolism, and his warfarin therapy will be started after the procedure to prevent stroke. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with ipratropium if necessary. His cardiac function will be monitored closely, and he will receive electrical cardioversion and ablation if necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with atrial flutter, heart failure, and acute diastolic heart failure. They underwent a successful ablation procedure and have been receiving treatment with medications such as lisinopril, lopressor, and furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/92 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 90%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and they may develop other cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased mortality.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen their condition.
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications such as heparin and their recent ablation procedure may increase their risk of bleeding.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury, which could worsen their heart failure and overall condition.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 of 90% may indicate respiratory failure, which could worsen their overall condition.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and their recent ablation procedure may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen their condition and lead to sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   # DISPO: CCU for now, will likely be candidate for [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 3 after the

   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium infusion
* Diltiazem
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Lisinopril 5 mg po qd
* Metoprolol 25 mg po bid
* Warfarin 5 mg po qd

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Thromboembolic disease due to atrial flutter and CHF
* Respiratory failure due to COPD
* Hyperglycemia due to DMII
* Hypertension due to HTN
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial flutter and CHF
* Infection due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP
* DVT and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and CHF

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.4
* Hct: 38.5
* Plt: 247
* Cr: 0.7
* Glucose: 162
* Other lab results are within normal limits

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Well appearing in NAD
* Mild wheezing in R lower lung field
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Very mild pitting edema

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing warfarin 5 mg po qd for at least one month and possibly long-term due to CHADS2 score
* Restarting lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid
* Continuing furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis
* Monitoring for thromboembolic disease and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed
* Monitoring for respiratory failure and adjusting therapy as needed
* Monitoring for hyperglycemia and adjusting insulin sliding scale as needed
* Monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias and adjusting therapy as needed
* Monitoring for infection and adjusting therapy as needed

The patient's disposition is currently in the CCU, but he will likely be transferred to the ward after the procedure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached and continue warfarin 5 mg po qd.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          appreciate final EP recommendations
   -          f/u 2PM laboratory data
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix 40 mg iv
   bolus. He has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now
   with mild pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. However, his O2 sat has been in the 88-92%
   range, which indicates that he may still have some fluid in his lungs.
   He could benefit from more diuresis, with approximately an additional
   1.5-2.0 L. We
ll give him another bolus of 40 cc IV lasix this AM and
   reassess I/O goals in the afternoon. We hope that his high SBP
   (130-140s) will come down with lasix 40 mg iv bolus, but if it remains
   high he may need to increase lisinopril - more complete management is
   better suited in the outpatient setting. In terms of long-term
   medications, we restarted him on lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol
   25 mg po bid.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg po bid
   -          Lisinopril 5 mg po qd
   -          Lasix 40 mg iv bolus
   -          Goal I/O: 1.5-2.0 net negative by PM (for a total of
   2.7-3.2L net negative, because he already diursed 1.2L this AM)
   -          PCP appointment for further follow-up.
   -          f/u ambulatory O2 sat
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   -          Continue O2 3L by nasal canula
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   of 2.0-3.0 is reached and continue warfarin 5 mg po qd.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s

   -          f/u 2PM laboratory data
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix 40 mg iv
   bolus. He has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now
   with mild pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. However, his O2 sat has been in the 88-92%
   range, which indicates that he may still have some fluid in his lungs.
   He could benefit from more diuresis, with approximately an additional
   1.5-2.0 L. We
ll give him another bolus of 40 cc IV lasix this AM and
   reassess I/O goals in the afternoon. We hope that his high SBP
   (130-140s) will come down with lasix 40 mg iv bolus, but if it remains
   high he may need to increase lisinopril - more complete management is
   better suited in the outpatient setting. In terms of long-term
   medications, we restarted him on lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol
   25 mg po bid.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg po bid
   -          Lisinopril 5 mg po qd
   -          Lasix 40 mg iv bolus
   -          Goal I/O: 1.5-2.0 net negative by PM (for a total of
   2.7-3.2L net negative, because he already diursed 1.2L this AM)
   -          PCP appointment for further follow-up.
   -          f/u ambulatory O2 sat
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at

Based on the sub-intern progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN, and atrial flutter, underwent successful ablation for atrial flutter. He was transferred from another hospital for further management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate mostly in the 80s-90s, and blood pressure slightly high overnight. He has mild pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the lung bases.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His liver enzymes are slightly elevated. His INR is 1.9, and he will continue to receive heparin bridge until his INR goal of 2.0-3.0 is reached.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient will continue to receive metoprolol for rate control, and warfarin 5 mg po qd for at least one month. He will also receive heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal.
2. CHF: The patient will receive another bolus of 40 mg IV lasix and reassess his I/O goals in the afternoon. He may benefit from more diuresis, with approximately an additional 1.5-2.0 L.
3. WHEEZING: The patient's extensive history of smoking puts him at risk for COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and is saturating low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in the outpatient environment.
4. CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years. He should be on a baby aspirin.
5. DMII: The patient has a history of diabetes. His sugars are high on admission, and he will receive insulin sliding scale.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of dyslipidemia. He will continue his home regimen.
7. HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. His home blood pressure medications will be held, and he will receive lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid.
8. FEN: The patient will follow a cardiac diet and fluid restrictions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thromboembolic disease due to atrial flutter ablation, which can be prevented with anti-coagulation therapy.
2. CHF exacerbation due to fluid overload, which can be managed with diuresis and fluid restriction.
3. Respiratory failure due to COPD, which can be managed with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
4. Coronary artery disease due to his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score, which can be managed with aspirin therapy.
5. Hypoglycemia due to insulin sliding scale, which can be managed with glucose monitoring and treatment.
6. Hyperlipidemia due to his history of dyslipidemia, which can be managed with his home regimen.
7. Hypertension due to his history of hypertension, which can be managed with his home blood pressure medications and lisinopril.

The patient's plan for discharge is to [**Hospital Ward Name 408**] or home, with follow-up with his PCP and ambulatory O2 sat."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.

   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.

   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.

   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.

   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He underwent successful ablation yesterday and is currently being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 90-103 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/92 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 90% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 247 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He is currently being treated with warfarin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and furosemide.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thromboembolic disease due to the risk of atrial flutter and the patient's CHADS2 score.
2. Worsening of congestive heart failure due to fluid overload and high blood pressure.
3. Respiratory failure due to COPD and wheezing.
4. Hyperglycemia due to diabetes and the need for insulin sliding scale.
5. Hypertension due to the patient's history of hypertension and the need for blood pressure management.
6. Liver enzyme elevation due to the patient's history of liver disease and the need for close monitoring.
7. Infection due to the patient's history of smoking and the need for prophylaxis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing warfarin and metoprolol for atrial flutter management.
2. Restarting lisinopril and furosemide for congestive heart failure management.
3. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting medications as needed.
4. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and providing oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Monitoring the patient's glucose levels and adjusting insulin sliding scale as needed.
6. Monitoring the patient's liver enzyme levels and adjusting medications as needed.
7. Providing prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

The patient's disposition is expected to be transferred to the CCU for further management and then to a hospital ward for continued care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent ablation yesterday which
   successfully converted him to NSR.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.

   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent ablation yesterday which
   successfully converted him to NSR.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN, who was transferred from another hospital for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. He underwent successful ablation yesterday, which converted him to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). He is currently on multiple medications, including heparin, diltiazem, midazolam, fentanyl, and furosemide. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 156/92 mmHg. He has a history of atrial flutter, which has been difficult to rate control despite multiple agents, and is at risk for thromboembolism with cardioversion. He is also at risk for congestive heart failure (CHF) due to his tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thromboembolism: The patient is at high risk for thromboembolism with cardioversion, which could lead to stroke or pulmonary embolism.
2. CHF: The patient's tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy could worsen his CHF, leading to decreased cardiac output and further fluid overload.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases his risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin, which increases his risk for bleeding complications, such as hematomas or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases his risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial flutter and CHF increases his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of atrial flutter and CHF increases his risk for neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.
2. Monitor the patient's heart rate and blood pressure closely to prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and CHF.
3. Provide respiratory support, such as oxygen therapy, to prevent respiratory complications.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and provide prophylactic antibiotics as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular and neurological status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Consider echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess cardiac function and evaluate for potential cardiovascular complications."
