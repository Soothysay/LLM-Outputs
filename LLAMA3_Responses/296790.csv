   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this) --> will give 1 L NS at 300 cc/hr for now while waiting
   for HD
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --???will reoffer NG tube for bowel decompression given high pitched
   bowel sounds
   --???concern DIC, given decr Hct, plt, higher FDP, rising INR (but
   elevated fibrinogen)
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control --> if remains hypertensive, will consider
   labetolol IV (posibly drip)
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- patient with foley in overnight, but remove as soon as clinically
   able to decrease risk of UTI
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- may have to place NG tube for abd distention today (son coming in
   this afternoon, will discuss)
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes, NPO for now, hold IVF for now (consider IVF if BP
   decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch
   .
   # Access: peripherals, 18g R EJ, 20g L PIV, RAVF
   .
   # Code: full code-- confirmed with son on admission to ICU
   .
   # Communication: Patient, son, [**Name (NI) 9875**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9876**]. ""signed""
   ICU consent over the phone on admission

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, renal failure, and hypertension. He has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. He has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is on warfarin. The patient has been experiencing severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and has been treated with IV morphine and NPO status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), hyperbilirubinemia, and hypocalcemia. His blood glucose levels are normal, but he has been given IV insulin due to his history of diabetes mellitus (DMII).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 148/54 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals mild faint crackles at the lung bases, and the patient is confused and fearful.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with no history of pancreatitis, and his laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia. He is at risk for complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. He is at risk for further deterioration of his renal function and may require further interventions such as peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as beta blockers or diuretics.
4. AFIB: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for stroke and may require further management with anticoagulant therapy.
5. DMII: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as metformin or insulin.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as statins.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient is at risk for complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for further deterioration of his renal function and may require further interventions such as peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Hypertension: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as beta blockers or diuretics.
4. AFIB: The patient is at risk for stroke and may require further management with anticoagulant therapy.
5. DMII: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as metformin or insulin.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease and may require further management with medications such as statins.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a number of potential medical complications, including pancreatitis, renal failure, hypertension, AFIB, DMII, and hypercholesterolemia. He requires close monitoring and management of his conditions to prevent complications and improve his overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), NPO for now, hold IVF for now
   (consider IVF if BP decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), NPO for now, hold IVF for now
   (consider IVF if BP decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute pancreatitis, and hypertension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 148/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis, with elevated amylase and lipase levels. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's platelet count is low, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding.

The patient is receiving treatment for pancreatitis, including IV morphine for pain control and IV fluids for hydration. The patient is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD, hypertension, and a history of anemia. The patient is also taking medications for hypertension, including imdur, metoprolol, and norvasc.

The patient's social history is significant for frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and a history of seasonal allergies.

The patient's physical examination is significant for mild faint crackles at the lung bases, indicating possible pulmonary edema. The patient's abdomen is tender to palpation, and the patient has a mild effusion and volume depletion.

The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of DIC, which is a potential complication of pancreatitis. The patient's platelet count is low, and his INR is elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient's bilirubin level is elevated, indicating a risk of jaundice.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is severe and may require surgical intervention.
2. DIC: The patient's DIC is a potential complication of pancreatitis and may require anticoagulation therapy.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled and may require medication to manage.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen due to the patient's pancreatitis and DIC.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient's bilirubin level is elevated, indicating a risk of jaundice.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen due to the patient's pancreatitis and DIC.
7. Cardiovascular failure: The patient's hypertension and ESRD may increase the patient's risk of cardiovascular failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. IV morphine for pain control
2. IV fluids for hydration
3. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin to prevent deep vein thrombosis
4. Antibiotics to treat UTIs
5. Medication to manage hypertension
6. Medication to manage liver function tests
7. Close monitoring of the patient's condition to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags; continues to be thrombocytopenic
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - continue vancomycin (day #1 = [**1-9**])
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), NPO for now, hold IVF for now
   (consider IVF if BP decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags; continues to be thrombocytopenic
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - continue vancomycin (day #1 = [**1-9**])
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications are noted:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with no prior history of pancreatitis. The cause is unclear, but it may be related to the antibiotic augmentin, which was started two days prior to the symptoms. The patient is in considerable pain and is being treated with IV morphine and standing Tylenol.
2. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis three times a week. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the physician is concerned about potential complications such as hyperkalemia and acidosis.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with home medications. The physician is concerned about potential hypotension in the setting of pancreatitis and is avoiding lowering the blood pressure too aggressively.
4. Fever: The patient's temperature spiked overnight, and cultures have been sent to determine the cause. The physician is concerned about potential infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and pancreatitis.
5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing confusion and fear, which is a concern in elderly patients. The physician is managing this with pain control, frequent reorientation, and consideration of medications such as haloperidol or seroquel.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to the pancreatitis or a bleeding disorder. The physician is monitoring the platelet count and is concerned about potential bleeding complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin. The physician is concerned about potential hypoglycemia, particularly in the setting of NPO status.
8. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with subcutaneous heparin. The physician is concerned about potential bleeding complications and is monitoring the patient's platelet count.
9. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with stress ulcer prophylaxis and antibiotics.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Pain control with IV morphine and standing Tylenol.
2. Continue vancomycin for coverage of hospital-acquired organisms.
3. Monitor calcium levels closely.
4. Trend LFTs and consider MRCP if not improving.
5. Hold on NG tube for bowel decompression.
6. Continue sevelamer with meals once taking PO's.
7. Monitor Hct and consider transfusions as necessary.
8. Continue home medications, including insulin and metoprolol.
9. Monitor for potential complications such as DVT, VAP, and bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, and without DIC evidence on peripheral smear;
   believe INR still rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check pm CBC and coags
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u repeat smear as outpatient
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - continue vancomycin (day #1 = [**1-9**])
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), NPO for now, hold IVF for now,
   getting HD, consider D5W at 75 cc/hour as NPO.
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pancreatitis. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis three times a week. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.7°F, heart rate 93 bpm, blood pressure 192/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 8.3 K/uL, hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL, platelet count 83 K/uL, and creatinine 2.1 mg/dL.
* Radiology results: Chest X-ray showed a possible infiltrate, which is being re-evaluated.
* Medications: The patient is receiving vancomycin for coverage of hospital-acquired organisms, ceftriaxone for pneumonia, and fentanyl for pain control.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Pancreatitis, which is acute and likely related to the patient's history of ESRD.
* Hypoglycemia, which is being treated with IV morphine and standing tylenol.
* Renal failure, which is being managed with hemodialysis.
* Hypertension, which is being treated with home medications and close monitoring.
* Delirium, which is being managed with pain control, frequent reorientation, and consideration of antipsychotic medications.
* Thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored and treated with platelet transfusions as needed.
* Elevated liver enzymes, which are being monitored and treated with supportive care.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis, which is being monitored for and treated with antibiotics and supportive care.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is being monitored for and treated with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
* Cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrest, which are being monitored for and treated with antiarrhythmic medications and cardioversion as needed.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, which are being monitored for and treated with supportive care and endoscopy as needed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing hemodialysis three times a week.
* Monitoring and treating the patient's medical complications, including pancreatitis, hypoglycemia, renal failure, hypertension, delirium, and thrombocytopenia.

   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   -- f/u urine culture
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- change NPO to clear liquid diet and advance as tolerated
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation
 f/u with PCP
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinue vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   - CXR at 10am tomorrow morning
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   -- note BP cuff has been on leg
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- restart sevelamer  w/ meals now that trying PO
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin; hold today
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   -- f/u urine culture
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), clear liquid diet with advance
   as tolerated, hold IVF for now, getting HD.
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin;
   hold warfarin today
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient's temperature spiked to 101.7°F (38.7°C) and was pan-cultured. The patient was started on vancomycin for coverage of hospital-acquired organisms.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, with no history of pancreatitis and no evidence of ethanol or triglyceride elevation. The patient is in considerable pain and appears volume depleted.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, ranging from 180s/60s to 216/113 mmHg. The patient was previously taking medications for hypertension, including imdur, metoprolol, and norvasc.
* Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis three times a week. The patient received 3L of fluid on the previous day.
* Delirium: The patient is experiencing confusion and fear, which is a concern in the elderly patient in the ICU setting.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are controlled with insulin, but the patient is at risk of hypoglycemia due to NPO status and prior insulin administration.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely due to hemoconcentration.
* History of anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, but there is no evidence of active bleeding from the GI tract.
* History of TIA/CVA: The patient has a history of TIA/CVA, but there are no acute concerns or neuro deficits.
* Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and the patient is holding home atorvastatin.
* Seasonal allergies: The patient has seasonal allergies and is continuing on home fluticasone.
* FEN: The patient is replete with electrolytes, and the patient's diet is being advanced as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
* Pancreatitis-related complications: The patient's pancreatitis could lead to complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or pancreatic duct obstruction.
* Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing renal failure could worsen due to the patient's current condition and treatment.
* Hypertension-related complications: The patient's hypertension could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident.
* Delirium-related complications: The patient's delirium could lead to complications such as falls, skin breakdown, or respiratory failure.
* Hypoglycemia-related complications: The patient's hypoglycemia could lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or even death.
* Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia could lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased tolerance to therapy.
* Hypercholesterolemia-related complications: The patient's elevated LFTs could lead to complications such as liver damage or failure.
* Seasonal allergy-related complications: The patient's seasonal allergies could lead to complications such as bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or skin rash.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Fentanyl and haloperidol for pain and delirium management
* IV morphine and standing Tylenol for pain management
* Zofran and compazine for nausea and vomiting
* LFT monitoring and trend
* CXR and abdominal CT scan to evaluate for pancreatitis and other complications
* FEN and electrolyte monitoring
* Renal function monitoring and HD as needed
* Blood glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment as needed
* Anemia monitoring and transfusion as needed
* Hypercholesterolemia management and lipid profile monitoring
* Seasonal allergy management and medication adjustment as needed."

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- continue to advance diet as tolerated (tolerating clears well now)
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily

   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation

   #. FEVER: Spiked temp yesterday (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement). Afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinued vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. Afib with RVR: Patient into afib with RVR to 140s on [**1-10**],
   non-responsive to metoprolol, responded to dilt gtt. Now in afib but
   without tachycardia, s/p dilt gtt.
   - Continue home metoprolol PO (with consideration to adding dilt prn)

   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   supratherapeutic.
   - hold coumadin, check daily INR
   - can hold SQH now that supratherapeutic

   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control

   # Confusion: Improved. More fearful and confused previously
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation

   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current

   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and delirium, which have been managed with medications. He has also been experiencing abdominal pain, which has been controlled with pain medication.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). His blood cultures are pending, and he has a yeast infection in his urine.

The patient's medical history includes a history of anemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and seasonal allergies. He is currently taking medications for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ESRD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is not resolving, and there is a risk of further complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or pancreatic duct obstruction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of further complications such as cardiovascular events, stroke, or renal damage.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of further complications such as uremic syndrome, electrolyte imbalances, or cardiovascular events.
4. Infections: The patient's yeast infection in his urine is not resolving, and there is a risk of further complications such as sepsis, urinary tract obstruction, or kidney damage.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is not resolving, and there is a risk of further complications such as confusion, agitation, or falls.
6. Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of further complications such as chronic pain, bowel obstruction, or pancreatitis.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not resolving, and there is a risk of further complications such as fatigue, weakness, or cardiovascular events.
8. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, and there is a risk of further complications such as liver failure, jaundice, or encephalopathy.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical complications to prevent further deterioration and ensure optimal care."

   Blood cultures pending.
   CXR [**1-10**]:
   The patient continues to be in mild volume overload giving the
   bilateral hilar
   engorgement and perihilar vascular engorgement as well as
   indistinctness of
   the perihilar vessels. The degree of the vascular engorgement/pulmonary
   edema
   is unchanged, mild. Bibasilar opacities are present but overall, there
   is
   improved aeration of the lung bases. Small bilateral pleural effusion
   is
   unchanged. There are no new focal consolidations, but the left
   retrocardiac
   opacity might represent a combination of atelectasis and infection.
   CXR from this AM not performed yet.
   Assessment and Plan
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
 NAUSEA / VOMITING
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- continue to advance diet as tolerated
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation
 f/u with PCP
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp yesterday (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement). Afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinued vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. Afib with RVR: Patient into afib with RVR to 140s, non-responsive to
   metoprolol, now on dilt gtt.
   - Start diltiazem 30mg qid and wean down dilt gtt as tolerated
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   supratherapeutic.
   - continue coumadin; hold today again
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   -- note BP cuff has been on leg
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- restart sevelamer  w/ meals now that trying PO
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   -- f/u urine culture
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), clear liquid diet with advance
   as tolerated, hold IVF for now, getting HD.
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin;
   hold warfarin today
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- continue to advance diet as tolerated
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation
 f/u with PCP
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp yesterday (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement). Afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinued vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. Afib with RVR: Patient into afib with RVR to 140s, non-responsive to
   metoprolol, now on dilt gtt.
   - Start diltiazem 30mg qid and wean down dilt gtt as tolerated
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   supratherapeutic.
   - continue coumadin; hold today again
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   -- note BP cuff has been on leg

   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation

   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]

   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and is currently in sinus rhythm. He has been experiencing tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and pain, and has been treated with various medications including metoprolol, labetalol, and diltiazem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/62 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. He is receiving IV fluids and has been advanced to a clear liquid diet.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and kidney dysfunction. His liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and his calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray (CXR), show mild volume overload, bilateral hilar engorgement, and small bilateral pleural effusions. The CXR also shows bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis or infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis-related complications, such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
2. Renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic syndrome.
3. Hypertensive crisis, which can cause cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
4. Afib-related complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis, which can be caused by the patient's underlying medical conditions or the use of invasive devices.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be caused by the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding or the use of anticoagulant medications.
7. Hyperglycemia, which can be caused by the patient's diabetes and the use of corticosteroids.
8. Hyperkalemia, which can be caused by the patient's kidney dysfunction and the use of potassium-sparing diuretics.
9. Hypocalcemia, which can be caused by the patient's kidney dysfunction and the use of calcium-channel blockers.
10. Delirium, which can be caused by the patient's underlying medical conditions, medication use, or the ICU environment.

The patient's care plan includes close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies, as well as treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals as necessary. The patient's pain management will be optimized, and his blood glucose levels will be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia. The patient's fluid status will be carefully monitored to prevent volume overload and hypovolemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) in the intensive care unit (ICU) with pancreatitis and hypertension. She is currently being treated for tachycardia, nausea/vomiting, delirium/confusion, hypoglycemia, pain control, renal failure, and pancreatitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 70s-80s, blood pressure 136/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 90%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib/RVR) and is currently taking medications to control her heart rate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, as well as elevated lipase and amylase levels, consistent with pancreatitis. Her blood glucose levels are also elevated, and she has a history of hypoglycemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen or lead to complications such as pancreatic abscesses, fistulae, or sepsis.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's Afib/RVR may lead to complications such as stroke, cardiac arrest, or heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen or lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremic syndrome.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of bleeding.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
7. Infection: The patient's pancreatitis and ESRD may increase her risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections or sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to control her heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.
3. Continue to treat the patient's pancreatitis with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust her dialysis schedule as necessary.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a regular hospital floor if her condition improves and she is stable."
