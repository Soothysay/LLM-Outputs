 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   ANEMIA
   Patient is hemodynamically stable. Hct in low 30's after transfusion.
   Patient being prepped for colonoscopy, which is to be done later today.
   Suspect right colon bleed given melena, no source in upper system by
   endoscopy, and relatively normal BUN/Creat ratio consistent with
   patient not being significantly volume depleted.  If patient bleeds
   aggressively today, would push for angiography.
   Patient intubated for procedures. Oxygenation good. Minute ventilation
   acceptable. If bleeding does not recur, would awaken patient and
   extubate.
   Patient unresponsive on exam but propofol in place. She had received
   several narcotics and benzodiazepines prior to transfer; initial
   somnolence likely related to that. Propofol started because she was
   pulling out tubes. Sounds as if she has had delirium in recent weeks.
   No evidence of CNS infection. Stool being checked for CDiff. Would stop
   all antibiotics except flagyl and monitor cultures.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-inch, 42.6 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient is intubated and on assist control ventilation with good ABG's on FIO2 0.4. The patient has received 2 units of PRBCs and has a Hct of 33.8%. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and acetaminophen. The patient is being prepped for a colonoscopy and is suspected to have a right colon bleed.

The patient has a stable blood pressure and remains on ventilator support. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube, ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, and FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, no signs of respiratory distress, and no evidence of cardiovascular instability. The patient's neurological examination reveals altered mental status, with the patient being unresponsive to commands and having no spontaneous movement.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 14.0 K/uL, Hct of 33.8%, and platelet count of 207 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, and chloride level of 109 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the GI bleed and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung injury.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of spontaneous movement increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures and brain injury.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to the use of invasive devices such as central lines and ventilator support.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction and perforation due to the GI bleed.

Assessment and plan:

The patient is hemodynamically stable, and the plan is to proceed with a colonoscopy to identify the source of the GI bleed. The patient will continue to receive respiratory support and will be monitored for signs of bleeding and respiratory complications. The patient's altered mental status will be monitored, and the plan is to awaken the patient and extubate if bleeding does not recur. The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and the plan is to stop all antibiotics except flagyl and monitor cultures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42.6 kg (52-inch) individual who was admitted to the ICU with a stable hemoglobin count and has been extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, with no assessment of movement, tone, or skin.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.0, hemoglobin count of 33.8, and platelet count of 207. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, and chloride level of 111 mEq/L. The patient's glucose level is 94 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena), impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough due to their inability to protect their airway.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for respiratory failure due to their inability to protect their airway.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and gastrointestinal bleed increase their risk for sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases their risk for skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status increases their risk for delirium, which can lead to increased agitation, confusion, and risk of falls.
6. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases their risk for aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure and pneumonia.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to their prolonged immobility and risk factors.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed increases their risk for stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage and perforation.
9. VAP: The patient's respiratory status and risk factors increase their risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-inch tall, 42.6 kg child who has been admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.0 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 207 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly low calcium level of 7.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for a previous gastrointestinal bleed, and the patient is at risk for further bleeding due to their underlying medical condition. The patient is also at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism due to their immobilization.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. The patient will also continue to receive prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to prevent further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pulmonary embolism
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
* Cardiac arrest

It is essential to closely monitor this patient's condition and adjust their plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection. Has good resp status prior to
   intubation.
   - use propofol for sedation given quicker metabolism. Her BPs have been
   holding stable
   - keep on PS overnight
   - SBT and RSBI in AM and extubate ASAP
   - routine vent care
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix. GI will urgently scope tonight given
   that she cannot come off anti-plt therapy
   - [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] place large bore PIV as well in case need for urgent volume
   - transfuse 2U PRBC now
   - apprec GI
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - plan as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need
   IR guided
   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve
   .
   # CAD s/p MI BMS [**1-9**]:
   - Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk
   - Hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI Bleed
   - Continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection despite GI bleed risk.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # PVD: Has hx of recent pseudoaneurysm
   - Continue ASA/plavix, monitor distal pulses.
   .
   # COPD: Continue Spiriva, Nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO while patient altered, maintenance IVF. Replete lytes PRN
   # PPX: Protonix IV, ASA/Plavix, Pneumoboot
   # Code: Full, Confirmed
   # Access: RIJ
   # Dispo: MICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old lady with a recent stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is currently being treated with Flagyl 500mg IV Q8. She is also being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors, and her antihypertensive medications have been held. She has a history of pseudoaneurysm and is being monitored for distal pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 14.0 x 10^9/L. Her hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL, and her platelet count is 207 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.05 ng/mL.

The patient's physical examination shows a thin build, poor dentition, and a soft, non-tender abdomen. Her respiratory and cardiovascular examinations are normal, except for a murmur of unknown significance. Her neurological examination shows increased tone and non-purposeful movement.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical problems and potential complications. The patient is at risk for sepsis, central nervous system infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She is also at risk for respiratory and cardiovascular complications due to her mechanical ventilation and cardiac history.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status may be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Central nervous system infection: The patient's altered mental status and increased tone may be indicative of a central nervous system infection, which could lead to meningitis or encephalitis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and current gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding and complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI and cardiac stenting may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
6. Pseudoaneurysm rupture: The patient's history of pseudoaneurysm may lead to rupture, which could be life-threatening.
7. C. difficile infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection and current treatment with Flagyl may lead to further complications, such as colitis or sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the patient's multiple medical problems and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection with AMS and prior to EGD. Has
   good resp status prior to intubation.
   - extubated yesterday, now on room air with normal oxygenation
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix.
   - CVL, and PIV
   - Hcts stable although slowly trending down
   - apprec GI
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - plan as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need
   IR guided
   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve
   .
   # CAD s/p MI BMS [**1-9**]:
   - Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk
   - Hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI Bleed
   - Continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection despite GI bleed risk.
   - Continue Simvastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with a history of recent stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. She was intubated for airway protection and has since been extubated and is now on room air with normal oxygenation. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and has been experiencing melena, which suggests a possible UGI source. She is also at risk for bleeding due to her recent stented MI and need for anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 14.0, and a platelet count of 207. Her troponin T level is 0.05, and her creatinine level is 0.6. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on flagyl 500mg IV q8 for possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin woman with poor dentition, an endotracheal tube, and an oral gastric tube. Her cardiovascular examination shows a regular sinus rhythm, and her respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued anticoagulation therapy with ASA and Plavix despite bleeding risk
* Hold antihypertensives
* Send H. pylori
* Consider repeat LP attempt for possible central infection
* Start flagyl 500mg IV q8 for possible C. diff infection
* Consider broadening antibiotic coverage if clinical condition worsens
* Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and central infection
* Consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzodiazepines and opioids if mental status does not improve

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Sepsis or central infection
* Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular complications due to stented MI
* Neurological complications due to altered mental status
* Renal failure due to dehydration or sepsis
* Pulmonary embolism due to anticoagulation therapy
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 71-year-old lady, is a recent stented MI patient with multiple medical problems, including CAD, PVD, COPD, and a history of UGIB. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis. She was intubated for airway protection and had a good respiratory status prior to intubation. She was extubated yesterday and is now on room air with normal oxygenation.

The patient's laboratory results show a slow trending down of her Hct levels, although they remain stable. Her WBC count is high, and she is being treated for possible C. diff infection. Her lactate levels are normal, and her vital signs are stable. She has a history of pseudoaneurysm and is on ASA and Plavix.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Ventilation: Intubated for airway protection, now on room air with normal oxygenation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: Monitoring for bleeding, plan for clears today, go lytely tonight, scope tomorrow.
3. Abdominal pain: Serial abdominal exams, plan as above for bleed.
4. Leukocytosis: Trending downward, no meningitis, likely C. diff.
5. Altered mental status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives, monitor with neuro exams.
6. CAD: Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk, hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI bleed.
