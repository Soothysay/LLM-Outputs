   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient present with SOB of unclear duration.  She is obese
   resulting in restriction and has significant left effusion on CXR.
   Patietn has history of two recent admissions for PNA, with worsened
   cough and rising WBC suggestive of PNA versus pulmonary abscess.  Per
   report, most recent echo reveals normal EF but not clear when this was
   performed.
   - Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl for PNA
   - consider CT chest if stable given limited value of CXR though cannot
   get contrast given renal failure
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - consider diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
   - obtaine echo
   .
   2.   Pancreatitis.  Elevated lipase in setting of cholecystitis with
   gallstones noted in GB is suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis.  Not on
   any clear offending meds and denies recent alcohol use.
   - trend lipase
   - NPO
   .
   3. Transaminitis.  Elevated LFTs but baseline LFTs unknnown.  [**Name (NI) **] sono
   raises the possibility of cholecystitis versus gallstone.  LFTs may be
   elevated most likely due to passed stone.  Normal T. bili with mildly
   elevated alk phos.
   - surgery following
   - Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
   - morphine for pain though not currently complaining of pain
   - NPO
   - consider MRCP per surgery
   .
   4.  Rash.  Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patietn was not on
   any antibiotics when the rash developed 3 days ago.  She was afebrile
   at rehab.  Rash is not pruritic.  Rash looks like drug rash, but there
   is not a clear offending medication.
   - follow rash
   - trend CBC with diff
   .
   4.  Renal failure.  Cr was reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**] and has
   been steadily rising over the past month and lasix has been gradually
   tapered off.  Her rising Cr at rehab was likely secondary to
   over-diuresis but may have lead to ATN.  Also multiple recent
   antibiotic exposures may have lead to AIN.
   - urine lytes, eos
   - renally dose all meds (Vanco by level)
   - follow UOP
   - IVF challenges

   5.  Lower extremity edema.  Patient with right greater than left LE
   edema that per patient is new over the past few days in the setting of
   stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function
   - hold lasix for now
   .
   6. Pleural effusion.  Persistent left sided pleural effusion.
   - consider thoracentesis for improvement of SOB

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, cholecystitis, and SOB. She has a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recent admissions for pneumonia. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.3°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 79 bpm, BP 111/57 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 2,517 mL of fluids and has a total output of 2,117 mL, with 517 mL of IV fluids and 100 mL of urine output.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 97%.
* Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic examinations are not assessed due to lack of data.
* Labs/Radiology: The patient's WBC count is 10.6 K/uL, Hct is 25.5%, Plt is 284 K/uL, Cr is 2.8 mg/dL, and Glucose is 90 mg/dL. The patient's LFTs are elevated, with an ALT of 73 and AST of 73. The patient's Amylase and Lipase levels are elevated, suggesting pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening respiratory status
* Sepsis secondary to pneumonia and cholecystitis
* Pancreatitis with potential for pancreatic necrosis
* Renal failure due to pre-existing kidney disease and antibiotic exposure
* Lower extremity edema with potential for DVT
* Anemia due to iron deficiency and potential bleeding
* Transaminitis with potential for liver failure
* Rash with potential for drug reaction or allergic reaction

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl for pneumonia
* Trending lipase for pancreatitis
* NPO for cholecystitis and pancreatitis
* Morphine for pain management
* Surgery following for cholecystitis
* Renally dosed medications
* IVF challenges
* Follow-up of UOP and urine lytes
* Echo to evaluate cardiac function
* Consider thoracentesis for improvement of SOB
* Trend Hct for anemia
* Active T&S expires on [**2125-2-22**]

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement of respiratory status."

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, and a history of recurrent pneumonia, admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory distress and cholecystitis. She has a significant left pleural effusion on CXR and persistently elevated WBC despite antibiotic therapy. The patient has developed a truncal rash, likely a drug allergic reaction, and is experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF) with rising creatinine levels. She also has anemia, and her husband has been notified.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pleural effusion put her at risk for respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent WBC elevation and antibiotic therapy indicate a high risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. ARF progression: The patient's rising creatinine levels and potential ATN or AIN could lead to further kidney damage and require dialysis.
4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's gallstone pancreatitis could lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or secondary infections.
5. Anemia worsening: The patient's history of iron deficiency anemia and ongoing bleeding could lead to worsening anemia and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. DVT or PE: The patient's 3+ L>R LE edema and history of recurrent pneumonia put her at risk for DVT or PE, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and mortality.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's EF 60% on echocardiogram and history of recurrent pneumonia put her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
8. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and multiple lines and drains increase her risk of infection, particularly VAP or catheter-related infections.

These potential complications require close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent or mitigate their effects and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   L pleural effusion on CXR.  Persistently elevated WBC despite abx
   therapy with various agents, the last being moxifloxacin.  Per OSH
   records, last echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D1/8 for HAP
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid, consider diagnostic/therapeutic
   thoracentesis
   - consider repeat TTE
   - consider CT chest if stable to better assess pleural effusion, assess
   for abscess.  Contrast study not possible given ARF.
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   Patient pain free at this time. Has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas for Cognitive, aprocedural input

   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and alk phos, ruling out
   significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has been steadily rising
   over the past month, in response to which lasix was tapered off.   Her
   rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis but could be now complicated
   by ATN.  Other possibility, especially given probably drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
   - 24 hour urine
   - consider consulting Renal re: Proteinuria
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   - IVF challenge
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient was not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic.  Probably
   drug allergic reaction given this history and peripheral eosinophilia.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: blood pressure (BP) 111/57 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 79 bpm, and respiratory rate (RR) 19 inspirations per minute
* Fluid balance: total in 2,517 mL, total out 400 mL, and a balance of 2,117 mL
* Laboratory results: white blood cell count (WBC) 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) 7.8 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) 284 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) 2.8 mg/dL, and glucose 90 mg/dL
* Physical examination: diffuse maculopapular rash across the back, abdomen, and chest, which blanches to palpation and is nonpruritic

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): the patient's Cr is rising, and she may have developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to antibiotic therapy.
2. Pancreatitis: the patient has elevated lipase levels, and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) is likely causing gallstone pancreatitis.
3. Transaminitis: the patient has mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis, but normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels rule out significant infiltrative disease or congestive hepatopathy.
4. Anemia: the patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, and her Hb level is 7.8 g/dL.
5. Lower extremity (LE) edema: the patient has 3+ LE edema that is likely secondary to fluid overload and may require further evaluation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and cardiac function.
6. Rash: the patient has a diffuse maculopapular rash that is likely a drug allergic reaction given her history and peripheral eosinophilia.
7. Anaphylactoid reaction: the patient may have developed an anaphylactoid reaction to antibiotics, which could be contributing to her ARF and other symptoms.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics for HAP
2. Albuterol and atrovent nebs for respiratory support
3. Ultrasound chest to evaluate for fluid and consider diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
4. Repeat TTE to evaluate cardiac function
5. Consider CT chest to better assess pleural effusion and assess for abscess
6. Consult pancreas for cognitive and procedural input to help with plan
7. Continue NPO and trend lipase for pancreatitis
8. Follow up with surgery and GI consult for cholecystitis
9. Renally dose medications and follow urine output (UOP)
10. IVF challenge to evaluate for ARF
11. Serial exams to monitor rash
12. LENIs to rule out DVT
13. TTE to evaluate cardiac function
14. Holding lasix in setting of ARF
15. Trend Hct and maintain active T+S for anemia
16. NPO and replete lytes PRN for FEN
17. HSQ for PPx
18. Double lumen PICC line placement
19. Full code status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with an SpO2 of 97%. The ABG report shows a pH of 7.21, indicating respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of EF 60% and is at risk for cardiac complications.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cholelithiasis and dilated CBD, likely causing gallstone pancreatitis.
* Hepatic: The patient has mildly elevated LFTs, likely due to cholelithiasis/cholecystitis.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with a rising creatinine level, and is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
* Dermatological: The patient has a truncal rash, likely due to a drug allergic reaction.
* Musculoskeletal: The patient has 3+ L>R LE edema, which may be related to DVT or cardiac function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening respiratory acidosis
* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, due to cardiac dysfunction
* Pancreatitis complications, such as pancreatic abscess or sepsis
* Hepatic complications, such as liver failure or encephalopathy
* Renal complications, such as ATN or AIN, which can lead to kidney failure
* Infectious complications, such as sepsis or bacteremia, due to the patient's history of PNA and cholecystitis
* Allergic reactions to medications or other substances
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's LE edema

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for HAP
* Ultrasound chest to evaluate for fluid and consider diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
* Repeat TTE to evaluate cardiac function
* Consider CT chest to assess pleural effusion and abscess
* Consult Pancreas/GI for input on plan
* Continue NPO and trend lipase for pancreatitis
* Consult Renal for input on plan
* Renally dose medications
* Follow UOP and consider IVF challenge
* Serial exams for rash
* LENIs to r/o DVT
* TTE to evaluate cardiac function
* Holding lasix in setting of ARF
* Trend Hct and maintain active T+S for anemia
* NPO, replete lytes PRN
* HSQ for FEN
* Double lumen PICC placed for access

The patient's current disposition is ICU for now, with potential transfer to the floor today."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left.
   Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and vanc/zosyn.  Per OSH records, last
   echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D2/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid
   - TTE today
   - IP consult today for diagnostic thoracentesis
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time. Has
   follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - advance diet
 if symptoms or significant worsening of lipase then
   place nasojejunal tube
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and borderline alk phos,
   ruling out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or
   obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has trended from 2.8 to 3.0
   has been steadily rising over the past month, in response to which
   lasix was tapered off.   Her rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis
   but could be now complicated by ATN.  Other possibility, especially
   given probably drug allergic reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is
   total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
 prerenal
   - 24 hour urine
  Pending for protein
   - Renal consult today re: proteinuria, rising Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - TTE to evaluate cardiac function
   - holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  f/up recs from Renal regarding possible proteinuria contributing to
   edema
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   # anemia
 History of iron deficiency anemia.
   - trend Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   # low blood pressure, asympomatic
   - will review records for baseline blood pressures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypothyroidism, obesity, and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has significant atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left, which is contributing to her SOB. She requires new oxygen therapy.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has pancreatitis, likely caused by gallstone pancreatitis, with elevated lipase levels and dilated CBD.
* Hepatic: The patient has mildly elevated LFTs consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) with rising creatinine levels, likely secondary to overdiuresis and possibly complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, likely due to iron deficiency.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of recurrent PNA, which may have contributed to her cardiac function, as evidenced by an echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's significant atelectasis and undrainable pleural effusion on the left may lead to respiratory failure.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
* ARF: The patient's rising creatinine levels may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular instability or increased risk of infection.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of recurrent PNA and possible cardiac dysfunction may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or arrhythmias.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for HAP and cholecystitis
* Ultrasound chest to evaluate for fluid
* TTE to evaluate cardiac function
* IP consult for diagnostic thoracentesis
* Renal consult to evaluate proteinuria and rising creatinine levels
* Dose adjustment of medications to ensure renal safety
* Serial exams to monitor for signs of allergic reactions or other complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, as well as to optimize her respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular function."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left.
   Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and vanc/zosyn.  Per OSH records, last
   echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D2/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid, consider diagnostic/therapeutic
   thoracentesis
   - TTE today
   - consider CT chest if stable to better assess pleural effusion, assess
   for abscess.  Contrast study not possible given ARF.
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time. Has
   follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and borderline alk phos,
   ruling out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or
   obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has trended from 2.8 to 3.0
   has been steadily rising over the past month, in response to which
   lasix was tapered off.   Her rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis
   but could be now complicated by ATN.  Other possibility, especially
   given probably drug allergic reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is
   total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
   - 24 hour urine
  Pending for protein
   - consider consulting Renal re: Proteinuria
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis, and has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, transaminitis, acute kidney injury (ARF), and a truncal rash. The patient has a double lumen PICC line in place and is currently receiving antibiotics and other medications.

The patient's CT scan showed large left-sided pleural effusion, small right-sided pleural effusion, atelectasis, and diffuse calcifications in the pancreas, consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated lipase and amylase levels, as well as mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/45 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support includes albuterol and atrovent nebs.

The patient's abdominal examination shows a soft, distended abdomen with bowel sounds present. Her extremities show 2+ edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Her kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL. Her urine electrolyte results are pending.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued antibiotics for HAP
* Ultrasound chest to look for fluid and consider diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis
* TTE today to evaluate cardiac function
* Consider CT chest if stable to better assess pleural effusion and assess for abscess
* Continue NPO and trend lipase
* Consult Pancreas/GI for input
* Follow up with surgery recommendations
* Abx as above
* Morphine PRN for pain
* Renally dose meds
* Follow UOP
* Consider consulting Renal re: proteinuria

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to gangrene, perforation, or sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's ARF may worsen if not managed properly, leading to chronic kidney disease, dialysis dependence, or death.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to ventilator dependence, pneumonia, or death.
5. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to multi-organ failure, septic shock, or death.
6. Drug Allergic Reaction: The patient's drug allergic reaction may worsen if not managed properly, leading to anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, or cardiac arrest.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's DVT may worsen if not managed properly, leading to pulmonary embolism, chronic venous insufficiency, or death.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers may worsen if not managed properly, leading to infection, sepsis, or death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB and cholecystitis.
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient with h/o recurrent PNA, significant
   atelectasis with undrainable pleural effusion on the left.
   Persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and vanc/zosyn.  Per OSH records, last
   echocardiogram shows EF 60% in [**2124-12-25**].
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D2/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - ultrasound chest, looking for fluid
   - TTE today
   - IP consult today for diagnostic thoracentesis
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time. Has
   follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - continue NPO
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated LFTs consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis;  normal Tbili and borderline alk phos,
   ruling out significant infiltrative disease/congestive hepatopathy or
   obstruction
   - f/u surgery recs, GI consult
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; has trended from 2.8 to 3.0
   has been steadily rising over the past month, in response to which
   lasix was tapered off.   Her rising Cr likely secondary to overdiuresis
   but could be now complicated by ATN.  Other possibility, especially
   given probably drug allergic reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She is
   total body fluid overloaded
   - urine electrolytes pending
   - 24 hour urine
  Pending for protein
   - Renal consult today re: proteinuria, rising Cr
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   - TTE to evaluate cardiac function
   - holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  f/up recs from Renal regarding possible proteinuria contributing to
   edema
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, obesity, and recurrent pneumonia (PNA). She was admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) and cholecystitis. The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Pancreatitis: Elevated lipase levels, diffuse calcifications in the pancreas, and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) suggest gallstone pancreatitis.
2. Transaminitis: Mildly elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Rising creatinine levels (2.8 to 3.0) and proteinuria suggest ATN or AIN as potential causes.
4. Rash: A truncal rash, likely a drug allergic reaction to vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), is present.
5. Lower Extremity (LE) Edema: 3+ L>R LE edema is a relatively new development, which may be related to proteinuria or nutritional deficiencies.
6. Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia is present.
7. Low Blood Pressure: Asymptomatic low blood pressure is noted.
8. Fluid Overload: Total body fluid overload is present, which may be contributing to the patient's edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: Further progression of pancreatitis can lead to organ failure, sepsis, or death.
2. ARF: Continued progression of ARF can lead to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis.
3. Rash: The rash may worsen or spread, leading to further complications.
4. LE Edema: The edema may worsen, leading to increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased immune function.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen, leading to pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, or electrolyte imbalances.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these complications to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with transudative pleural effusion on the left.
   A tap on [**2-21**] found transudative fluid by all criteria. Additionally it
   was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase ratio of >/= 1 is
   overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy; hers is likely
   pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D3/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   -Has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significants. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She partially responded to blood and
   fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - F/U UPEP
   - renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   # anemia
 History of iron deficiency anemia. Has had chronic
   inflammation as well
   - transfuse with renal perfusion as goal, measured by creatinine
   - trend Hct
   - maintain active T+S
   # low blood pressure, asympomatic
   - will review records for baseline blood pressures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with transudative pleural effusion on the left.
   A tap on [**2-21**] found transudative fluid by all criteria. Additionally it
   was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase ratio of >/= 1 is
   overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy; hers is likely
   pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D3/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   -Has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - Consult Pancreas/GI for input
 help with plan.
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significants. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN. No urine Eos. She partially responded to blood and
   fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - F/U UPEP
   - renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   -serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   # anemia
 History of iron deficiency anemia. Has had chronic

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypothyroidism, obesity, and a recent admission for pneumonia (PNA). She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase and amylase levels, with a likely etiology of gallstone pancreatitis. The inflammatory process may be contributing to her acute kidney injury (ARF) and third spacing.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 3.0, and her urine electrolytes are consistently pre-renal. The likely causes of ARF are vascular depletion from overdiuresis and third spacing, with a possibility of allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) given her drug allergic reaction.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has mildly elevated liver enzymes, likely due to cholelithiasis/cholecystitis, which have improved over hospitalization.
4. Rash: The patient has a truncal rash, likely a drug allergic reaction to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, given her peripheral eosinophilia.
5. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has 3+ left greater than right edema, likely due to third spacing from pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia and chronic inflammation.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is asymptomatic, and she has a history of chronic inflammation.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for HAP
* Morphine for post-procedure pain
* Albuterol and atrovent nebs for respiratory support
* TPN for nutrition

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.6-11.2 K/uL
* Hct: 25.5-24.3%
* Plt: 273 K/uL
* Cr: 2.8-3.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90-81 mg/dL
* Lipase: 630-526 IU/L
* Amylase: 630-526 IU/L
* Albumin: 1.8 g/dL
* LDH: 177 IU/L
* Ca++: 6.6 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's current plan includes:

* Transfusing another unit of blood to avoid crystalloid without colloid
* Treating underlying conditions, including pancreatitis and ARF
* Following up with renal recommendations and medication dosing
* Monitoring urine output and adjusting fluid management accordingly
* Considering a nasojejunal tube for nutritional support
* Trending lipase and amylase levels
* Consulting with pancreas/GI for input on the patient's plan

The patient's overall condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and optimize her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left. A
   tap on [**2-21**] found exudative fluid by Light
s criteria (protein ratio).
   Additionally it was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase
   ratio of >/= 1 is overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy;
   hers is likely pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D4/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   - has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - f/u GI recs
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significance. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN; however, no urine eos.  She partially responded to
   blood and fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - f/u UPEP
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   - serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   - f/u LENIs

 History of iron deficiency anemia. Has had chronic
   inflammation as well
   - transfuse with renal perfusion as goal, measured by creatinine

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient is an 82-year-old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for pneumonia (PNA), and currently presenting with shortness of breath (SOB), cholecystitis, and pancreatitis.
* The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, chronic inflammation, and recent admission for PNA.
* The patient's laboratory results indicate:
	+ Elevated lipase and amylase levels, suggesting pancreatitis.
	+ Elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI).
	+ Mildly elevated liver enzymes, consistent with cholelithiasis/cholecystitis.
	+ Hypoalbuminemia, likely due to malnutrition and third spacing.
	+ Peripheral eosinophilia, suggesting a possible allergic reaction.
	+ Mild proteinuria and profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) in the urine, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including moxifloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime, but has not shown significant improvement.
* The patient has developed a rash, likely due to a drug allergic reaction, and has been treated with morphine for pain.
* The patient has also developed 3+ left lower extremity edema, likely due to third spacing and transudation from hypoalbuminemia.
* The patient's blood pressure has been asymptomatic, and the patient has been advised to resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies and low albumin contributing to edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further progression of pancreatitis, leading to sepsis or multi-organ failure.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections or allergic reactions.
* Progression of AKI, leading to dialysis dependence or end-stage renal disease.
* Development of respiratory failure due to SOB or pleural effusion.
* Worsening of cholecystitis or cholangitis, leading to biliary tract obstruction or rupture.
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypoalbuminemia.
* Further deterioration of liver function, leading to hepatic failure or coagulopathy.
* Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders due to ongoing diuresis and third spacing.
* Worsening of anemia, leading to transfusion dependence or end-stage anemia.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications listed above, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular reassessment and adjustments to treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with hypothyroidism, obesity, recent admission for
   PNA, here with SOB, cholecystitis and pancreatitis
   .
   # SOB
 New O2 requirement. Patient treated for reccurrent PNA, with
   persistently elevated WBC despite abx therapy with various agents, the
   last being moxifloxacin and, presently, vanc/zosyn. Patient has
   significant atelectasis with exudative pleural effusion on the left. A
   tap on [**2-21**] found exudative fluid by Light
s criteria (protein ratio).
   Additionally it was amylase [**Doctor First Name **] (ARPE). The ddx of ARPE with amylase
   ratio of >/= 1 is overwhelmingly pancreatitis and, rarely, malignancy;
   hers is likely pancreatitis. TTE excludes cardiac cause.
   - vanc/cefepime/flagyl D4/8 for HAP ; consider d/c if negative cultures
   and further evidence of allergy
   - morphine for post-procedure pain
   - follow up cultures of pleural fluid
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   # pancreatitis
 Elevated lipase in setting of cholelithiasis and
   dilated CBD ~ 10 mm.  Most likely etiology is gallstone pancreatitis.
   CT shows diffuse calcifications.  Patient pain free at this time.
   Lipase and Amylase rising on [**2-22**] with advancement of diet. The
   inflammatory factors produced by her pancreatitis could be altering her
   splanchnic circulation resulting in the ARF (below) and the third
   spacing. However, the third spacing is further compounded by the
   hypoalbuminemia that is related not only to inflammation but also
   malnutrition x 1 month. TPN is likely to worsen the inflammatory
   process
   - consider Nasojejunal tube today.
   - has follow up scheduled in [**Month (only) 349**].
   - trend lipase
   - f/u GI recs
   # ARF
 Cr reportedly 1.1 at rehab on [**1-30**]; peaked at 3.0 on on [**2-21**].
   Urine Lytes consistently pre-renal; Mild proteinuria.  Her rising Cr
   likely multifacatorial but mostly related to vascular depletion from
   overdiuresis and third spacing. The urine as spun on [**2-21**] to reveal
   profuse muddy brown casts (ATN) but also copious uric acid crystals of
   unknown significance. Still a possibility, given her drug allergic
   reaction, is AIN; however, no urine eos.  She partially responded to
   blood and fluid on [**2-22**].
   - transfuse another unit, avoid crystalloid without colloid
   - treat underlying condition
   - f/u UPEP
   - f/u renal recs
   - renally dose meds
   - follow UOP
   # transaminitis
 Mildly elevated liver enzymes consistent with
   cholelithiasis/cholecystitis that have improved over the
   hospitalization; most likely from cholecystitis.  normal Tbili and
   borderline alk phos, ruling out significant infiltrative
   disease/congestive hepatopathy or obstruction
   - abx as above
   - morphine PRN for pain
   # rash
 Patient with truncal rash.  Per rehab, patient w as not on any
   antibiotics when rash was first noticed 3 days prior to presentation,
   but at that time limited to back only.  Rash is nonpruritic. Daughter
   says patient was on vanc/zosyn.  Probably drug allergic reaction given
   this history and peripheral eosinophilia.
   - serial exams
   # LE edema
 Patient with 3+ L>R LE edema that per patient is a
   relatively new development since stopping lasix. Likely thirdspacing of
   pancreatitis and transudation from hypoalbuminemia
   -  holding lasix in setting of ARF
   -  will resume diet (ADAT) due to possible nutritional deficiencies/low
   albumin contributing to edema
   - f/u LENIs
