You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a stroke and was transferred due to hypotension, hypoxia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and his oxygen requirement has increased. He is also experiencing tachypnea and has a fever.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.6°C (96.1°F)
* Heart rate: 87 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 148/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 90%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 28.6%
* Platelet count: 266 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 145 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent stroke, atrial fibrillation, and possible pulmonary embolism. He is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and he is at risk for further hypoxia due to his atrial fibrillation and possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk for further hypotension due to his atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac tamponade.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is chronic, but it is worsening due to his hypoxia and hypotension.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to his hypoxia and hypotension, but it may also be due to sepsis or persistent end-organ ischemia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The patient is at high risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to his atrial fibrillation and possible pulmonary embolism.
6. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac tamponade may lead to cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and possible pulmonary embolism may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Hypoxia: Wean oxygen, obtain blood culture, repeat ABG, and consider CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
* Hypotension: F/u lactate, f/u renal output, and consider diltiazem to bring up blood pressure.
* Metabolic acidosis: Give lasix prn for volume overload.
* Lactic acidosis: F/u lactate.
* Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: Discuss anticoagulation with neuro and consider prophylactic heparin.
* Cardiac tamponade: Monitor for signs of cardiac tamponade and consider echocardiogram.
* Respiratory failure: Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider mechanical ventilation.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

 from this am, official read pending, but appears similar to
   yesterday morning with evidence of volume overload
   [**2141-2-11**] Head CT: 1. Interval increase in parenchymal hemorrhage within
   the left MCA infarct territory, now spanning a region of 5.2 x 3.3 cm.
   Associated increase in edema with mild increase in subfalcine rightward
   herniation, now measuring 5 mm.   2. New hyperdense focus in the right
   anterior frontal cortex could represent tiny site of hemorrhage,
   without mass effect or edema. Alternatively, this could be
   artifactual.  3. Stable right frontal infarct.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrahage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume
   overload
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition and
   free water boluses due to hypernatremia
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a recent stroke, hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, and pneumonia, who was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient's condition has deteriorated with worsening hypoxia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient is still tachypneic and has atrial fibrillation with right ventricular hypertrophy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, including atrial fibrillation, volume overload, and possibly aspiration post-stroke. The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and the patient's SpO2 is 90%.
2. Hypotension/RVR: The patient's hypotension and RVR are likely related to atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may also exacerbate the patient's hypoxia. The patient's blood pressure is 148/73 mmHg, and the patient's heart rate is 87 bpm.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely chronic, but has worsened due to hypoxia, hypotension, and hyperchloremia. The patient's lactate level is 16 mmol/L.
4. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia, and is not likely related to sepsis or persistent end-organ ischemia.
5. Stroke Evolution: The patient's stroke is continuing to evolve, with an increase in parenchymal hemorrhage and edema. The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation, but the neurology team is following the patient's condition and providing recommendations.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, with a total fluid input of 2,625 mL and a balance of 1,460 mL. The patient's urine output is 620 mL, and the patient's creatinine level is 2.3 mg/dL.
7. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress, with expiratory wheezes, scattered crackles, and rhonchi. The patient is requiring oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 90%.
8. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture and a high WBC count, which may indicate an ongoing infection.

Recommendations:

1. Wean oxygen therapy as tolerated.
2. Consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume overload.
3. Consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's lactate level and metabolic acidosis.
5. Limit IV fluids and replete electrolytes.
6. Consider NG tube for nutrition and free water boluses due to hypernatremia.
7. Continue prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin.
8. Discuss prognosis and goals of care with the patient's family, as the patient has a low probability of returning to their former baseline."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   - ASA 300mg PR daily
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition,
   free water boluses (hyperNa+ )and aspiration risk, however, will
   discuss with family the preference as pt pulled out NGT already.. If
   not, then start IVF (D5
 NS) at slow basal rate
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.  Will require Neuro input.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Diuresed briskly with Lasix gtt
   - Pt satting 100% on FIO2 60% via shovel mask
   - Pt nodded yes when asked ""Do you have difficulty breathing?"" and ""Do
   you feel tired?""
   - Family meeting with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], then phone conversations with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Family visited: made pt DNR/DNI, no escalation of care. Use morphine
   for comfort but NOT CMO. They would like to hear about prognosis from
   neurological perspective from the previous neuroICU team or neuro
   consultants.
   - Hypernatremia continues but not worse (147)... holding off on NG tube
   and free water boluses given the overall picture
   - Wrote for Zydis for agitation, has morphine for air hunger

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke, who was admitted to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement. He has been experiencing hypoxia, which is likely multifactorial, including atrial fibrillation, volume overload, and possible aspiration post-stroke. The patient's respiratory status has improved after receiving lasix and metoprolol. He has a history of pneumonia, and a recent head CT scan shows continued evolution of the stroke.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of factors, including atrial fibrillation, volume overload, and possible aspiration post-stroke. Weaning oxygen as tolerated and sputum gram stain and culture are recommended.
2. Hypotension/RVR: The patient's hypotension is likely due to atrial fibrillation with right ventricular failure, which may also be contributing to his hypoxia. Furosemide and metoprolol may help to improve his blood pressure.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal insufficiency, which is compensated by tachypnea. Monitoring and addressing his electrolyte imbalance are important.
4. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia, and is not expected to be due to sepsis or persistent end-organ ischemia.
5. Recent Stroke: The patient's stroke is likely to have a poor prognosis, and he may not be a candidate for anticoagulation. Neurological input is recommended.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, which may contribute to his hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Limiting IV fluids and repleting electrolytes are important.
7. Aspiration Risk: The patient has a high risk of aspiration due to his recent stroke and respiratory status. A nasogastric tube may be necessary to prevent aspiration.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypernatremia, needs to be monitored and addressed.
9. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a high risk of respiratory distress due to his recent stroke and respiratory status. Close monitoring and treatment of his respiratory status are important.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. They have been diuresed briskly with Lasix and are currently receiving morphine for comfort. The patient's family has made them DNR/DNI and has requested that the neuro team provide a prognosis from a neurological perspective.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 146/64 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 100% on FIO2 60%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1801 mL, and they have received a total of 49 mL of IV fluids.

The patient's laboratory results show hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147 mEq/L. Their complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 20.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 33.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 370 K/uL. Their blood chemistry shows elevated levels of creatinine, troponin-T, and lactic acid.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway due to their CVA and pneumonia increases their risk of aspiration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's community-acquired pneumonia can worsen their respiratory status and increase their risk of complications.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium level can lead to dehydration, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias if not addressed.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload and increase their risk of complications.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count increase their risk of developing a secondary infection.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and creatinine level suggest potential cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's CVA and elevated lactic acid level suggest potential neurological complications, such as brain edema or seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU due to a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with ischemic stroke, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and altered mental status. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix and is receiving morphine for comfort. The patient's family has made the decision to withhold do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) orders, with the goal of maintaining comfort care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 60% FIO2 via a shovel mask.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is 147 mmol/L, which is above the normal range. This may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, if not addressed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated appropriately.
3. CVA: The patient has a cerebrovascular accident, which may lead to further neurological deterioration if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but may deteriorate if not monitored closely.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of pneumonia and the use of antibiotics.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, which may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Renal failure: The patient has a high risk of developing renal failure due to the use of diuretics and the presence of hypernatremia.
9. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to the presence of pneumonia and the use of antibiotics.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not specified, but may be at risk due to the patient's altered mental status and lack of oral intake."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrahage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume
   overload
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrahage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - consider lasix drip for slow diuresis in the setting of volume
   overload
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and recent stroke. The patient was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial hypoxia due to atrial fibrillation, volume overload from IV fluids, and possibly aspiration post-stroke, as well as pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension/RVR: The patient's hypotension is likely due to atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be exacerbating hypoxia.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has chronic metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, which is being partially compensated by tachypnea. The current worsening metabolic acidosis is due to hypoxia/hypotension and hyperchloremia.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia.
5. Recent stroke: The patient's stroke is continuing to evolve, and the neuro team is following up and providing recommendations.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is not worsening, but requires close monitoring and potentially NG tube for nutrition and free water boluses.
7. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, which requires careful management to avoid further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture and high white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing renal insufficiency may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's hypernatremia and fluid overload increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and high white blood cell count increase the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.

In terms of the patient's prognosis and goals of care, it is essential to discuss these with the family, as the patient has a low probability of returning to his former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress on this admission. The patient's code status is presumed full, and it is crucial to consider the patient's wishes and values when making decisions about his care."

   triggering RVR and hypoxia.
   - Resp status much improved now with continued diuresis and rate
   control. Satting 100% on 2L O2 via NC.
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, started  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**]); given this may be just an aspiration pneumonitis and pt afebrile
   with decreasing WBC count, will d/c Vancomycin (MRSA neg x 1, will
   follow up on repeat MRSA swabs that pending). Continue unasyn while pt
   in hospital, then switch to augmentin as outpatient to complete a total
   abx course of [**6-16**] days. Want to avoid IV medications as placing a PICC
   may have greater risk than benefit as a portal of infection
   - resend sputum gram stain & culture (first sample showed oral flora)
   if pt able to produce sputum (unlikely)
   - hold lasix today as JVD not elevated and mucosa dry.
   .
   # Hypotension / afib with RVR, resolved: Was hypotensive initially in
   the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps leading to hypoxia (as
   above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic shock as pt is now
   maintaining normal pressures once rate was controlled; however pt does
   have a high WBC count and e/o possible aspiration pneumonitis/PNA
   - Change Metoprolol to per NGT, 12.5 mg TID. Uptitrate as tolerated.
   - abx for ?aspiration pna/pneumonitis as above.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Was previously stable at 147, now up to 151 in the
   setting of starting tube feeds despite also starting free water boluses
   per NGT.
   - Consider half strength TF
   - Free water deficit: 3L. Increase free water boluses to 300 cc Q4hrs.
   also gets 35 cc free water flushes Q1 hr with TF.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible (however no CTA given renal insufficiency).
   Acute decompensation again on [**2-11**] when pt had to lie flat for CT,
   triggering RVR and hypoxia.
   - Resp status much improved now with continued diuresis and rate
   control. Satting 100% on 2L O2 via NC.

   with decreasing WBC count, will d/c Vancomycin (MRSA neg x 1, will

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and stroke. He was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is on nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 100%. His ABG shows a pH of 7.18, which may indicate a chronic metabolic acidosis.
* Cardiovascular: He has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 76-111 bpm. His blood pressure is 122/48 mmHg, which is within normal limits.
* Neurological: He has a recent stroke, and his neurological status is unchanged from admission.
* Gastrointestinal: He has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place, and his tube feeds are being started with free water flushes and TFs.
* Renal: His creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL, indicating mild renal insufficiency.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic metabolic acidosis and atrial fibrillation may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's recent stroke and atrial fibrillation may increase his risk of hypoxia.
3. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's NGT and tube feeds may increase his risk of aspiration pneumonitis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's high WBC count and possible aspiration pneumonitis may increase his risk of sepsis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's mild renal insufficiency may worsen if he becomes dehydrated or if his kidney function declines further.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's chronic metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue diuresis and rate control to manage atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
* Start Vancomycin and Unasyn for possible aspiration pneumonitis.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
* Manage the patient's hypernatremia by increasing free water boluses and considering half-strength TF.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.
* Discuss the patient's code status with his family and consider tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) if necessary.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require close monitoring and careful management to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance, with a total intake of 977 mL and a total output of 1,468 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.8-20.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.6-37.0%
* Platelet count: 266-371 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8-2.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04-0.10 ng/mL
* Glucose: 113-132 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 17.0/30.9/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 289/6/0.10, ALT/AST: 22/19, Alk Phos/T Bili: 125/0.7, Differential-Neuts: 86.0%, Band: 1.0%, Lymph: 6.0%, Mono: 7.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Lactic Acid: 2.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.1 g/dL, LDH: 314 IU/L, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL, PO4: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
* CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), ischemic
* H/O pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP)
* ICU care: nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: the patient's airway is at risk due to the inability to protect it, which can lead to respiratory failure and aspiration.
* Cardiovascular complications: the patient's cardiac condition and electrolyte imbalance can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
* Infection: the patient's pneumonia and bacteremia can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
* Neurological complications: the patient's stroke and ischemic CVA can lead to further neurological deterioration and potential brain death.
* Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: the patient's fluid and electrolyte disorder can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
* Gastrointestinal complications: the patient's stress ulcer and potential gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to further complications, such as sepsis and multi-organ failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a history of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke, with a diagnosis of ischemic CVA. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, with eyes open but not responding to simple questions.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management medications, and anticoagulants. The patient has also been receiving nutritional support through a nasogastric tube (NGT) and has been on a regimen of fluids and electrolytes.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the patient's airway is at risk due to the inability to protect it. The patient is also at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and altered airway clearance.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to the inability to protect the airway.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury, and the patient may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a fluid and electrolyte disorder, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of CVA or stroke, and may be at risk for further neurological complications such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, or seizures.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place, and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.

 NS) at slow basal rate
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and recent stroke. He was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and critical aortic stenosis, which may contribute to his hypoxia. The note mentions that the patient's hypoxia is likely multifactorial, and that pulmonary edema due to atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure may be a significant contributor.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 122/48 mmHg, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may contribute to his hypotension. The note suggests that the patient's hypotension may be due to atrial fibrillation with right ventricular failure.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a chronic metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to his underlying renal insufficiency. The note mentions that the patient's metabolic acidosis is partially due to hypoxia and hypotension.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient has a lactic acidosis, which is likely due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia.
5. Recent stroke: The patient has had a recent stroke, which is likely to affect his neurological function.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has a fluid overload, which may be contributing to his hypoxia and metabolic acidosis.
7. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and has a history of tachypnea.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 11.8-20.5 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 28.6-37.0%
* Plt: 266-371 x 10^9/L

* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 314 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Ciprofloxacin
* Vancomycin
* Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn)
* Morphine Sulfate
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Metoprolol
* Subcutaneous heparin
* ASA 300mg PR daily
* Nutren Renal (Full) - 30 mL/hour

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia
* Atrial fibrillation
* Critical aortic stenosis
* Stroke
* Metabolic acidosis
* Lactic acidosis
* Fluid overload
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* End-organ failure

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the note mentions that he has a very low probability of returning to his former baseline. The patient's family has been informed of his prognosis and goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible.  Event last night post-CT scan likely
   tachypnea from lying flat and pulmonary edema that then triggered RVR
   and exacerbated the hypoxia.  Improved after lasix and metoprolol.
   Hypoxia most likely in the setting of pulm edema due to AS+afib with
   rvr.
   - wean o2 as tolerated
   - sputum gram stain & culture
 first sample was contaminant
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, start  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - no CTA given renal function; stroke with hemorrhage likely
   contraindication for anticoagulation: will discuss with neuro
   - change lasix drip to lasix 10mg q12hr
   - metoprolol 2.5 mg IV for RVR
 change to metoprolol 5mg q6hr
   .
   # Hypotension / RVR: in the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps
   leading to hypoxia (as above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic
   shock as transient with long periods of normotension with lower heart
   rate, though patient could have ongoing infections as well given
   positive UA and high WBC count.
   - f/u lactate
   - f/u renal out put
   - consider metoprolol 2.5 mg IV (or diltiazem or verapamil) if afib
   with rvr, this may bring up BP by lowering HR and improving filling
   pressure
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.
   - f/u lactate
 stable in [**1-10**] range
   .
   # Recent stroke: Repeat head CT evening of [**2-11**] shows continued
   evolution of stroke.  Neuro following and their recommendations and
   assessment is appreciated.  Patient likely not a candidate for
   anticoagulation, but would appreciate input from neuro on this
   question.
   - ASA 300mg PR daily
   .
   # FEN: Limit IVF, replete electrolytes, needs NG tube for nutrition,
   free water boluses (hyperNa+ )and aspiration risk, however, will
   discuss with family the preference as pt pulled out NGT already.. If
   not, then start IVF (D5
 NS) at slow basal rate
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   .
   # Access: peripheral IV x 1 (patient pulled out 2 PIV earlier this am)
   .
   # Code: Presumed full.  Need to discuss prognosis and goals of care
   with family as patient has a very low probability of returning to his
   former baseline and will likely continue to have respiratory distress
   on this admission.  Will require Neuro input.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 91-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and a recent stroke. He was transferred to the ICU for tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxia: likely multifactorial, including atrial fibrillation, volume overload, and possible aspiration post-stroke.
2. Hypotension/RVR: likely due to atrial fibrillation with RVR, possibly exacerbated by hypoxia.
3. Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic, but worsening due to hypoxia/hypotension and hyperchloremia.
4. Lactic acidosis: expected due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia, but stable in the range of 1-10.
5. Recent stroke: with continued evolution on repeat head CT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and RVR.
2. Cardiovascular instability: due to atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and RVR.
3. Renal insufficiency: due to hypotension, hypoxia, and fluid overload.
4. Infection: despite the patient's low risk of pseudomonas, there is still a risk of developing an infection, particularly given the patient's positive urine culture and high WBC count.
5. Metabolic acidosis: which can lead to worsening organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
6. Stroke progression: with continued evolution on repeat head CT, there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.
7. Anticoagulation complications: given the patient's contraindication for anticoagulation, there is a risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive treatment of hypoxia and hypotension, and optimization of cardiovascular and respiratory function. Additionally, the patient's family should be involved in discussions regarding prognosis and goals of care, given the patient's low probability of returning to his former baseline and the likelihood of continued respiratory distress on this admission."

   CXR [**2141-2-14**]
   (my read) moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with HTN, critical AS, recent pneumonia, and now
   recent stroke who was transferred to the ICU on [**2-11**] for tachypnea,
   afib, hypotension, and increasing O2 requirement.
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial
 afib, volume overload from IVF in
   the setting of critical AS, and possibly aspiration post stroke as
   well.  PE also possible (however no CTA given renal insufficiency).
   Acute decompensation that prompted ICU transfer likely resulted from
   flash pulm edema from lying flat for CT that triggered RVR and hypoxiz.
   - Resp status much improved now with continued diuresis and rate
   control. Satting 100% on 2L O2 via NC.
   - CXR c/w aspiration, low risk Psuedomonas, started  Vanc/Unasyn (Day 1
   -[**2-13**])
   - resend sputum gram stain & culture (first sample showed oral flora)
   if pt able to produce sputum
   - consider changing lasix IV to per NGT
   - Consider changing metop IV to per NGT
   .
   # Hypotension / afib with RVR, resolved: Was hypotensive initially in
   the setting of Afib with rvr, also perhaps leading to hypoxia (as
   above).  Likely not due to vasodilatatory septic shock as pt is now
   maintaining normal pressures once rate was controlled; however pt does
   have a high WBC count and e/o aspiration PNA and positive UA.
   - Rate well controlled on metoprolol 5 IV Q6hrs: consider changing PO.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: appears to be chronic although we [**Male First Name (un) 344**]
t have
   older data. Metabolic acidosis due to renal insufficiency, compensated
   by tachypnea, current worsening metabolic acidosis partially due to
   hypoxia/hypotension and mainly due to hyperchloremia in the setting of
   fluid resuscitation.  Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: in the setting of transient hypotension and
   hypoxemia expected. Doubt to be due to sepsis or persistent end organ
   ischemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, critical aortic stenosis, recent pneumonia, and a recent stroke. He was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasodilators, and diuretics.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver enzymes. His chest X-ray reveals moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: likely multifactorial, due to atrial fibrillation, volume overload, and possible aspiration post-stroke.
2. Hypotension/atrial fibrillation with respiratory failure: likely due to flash pulmonary edema from lying flat for a CT scan, which triggered respiratory failure.
3. Metabolic acidosis: likely chronic, but worsening due to hypoxia, hypotension, and fluid resuscitation.
4. Lactic acidosis: likely due to transient hypotension and hypoxemia, and not related to sepsis or persistent end-organ ischemia.
5. Recent stroke: the patient's head CT scan shows continued evolution of the stroke.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and aspiration.
2. Sepsis: due to pneumonia and possible urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiac complications: due to atrial fibrillation, critical aortic stenosis, and possible cardiac ischemia.
4. Renal insufficiency: due to hypotension, fluid resuscitation, and possible sepsis.
5. Neurological complications: due to the recent stroke and possible aspiration.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: oxygen therapy and diuretics to manage respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac support: vasodilators and rate control medications to manage atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
3. Antibiotic therapy: to manage pneumonia and possible urinary tract infection.
4. Nutritional support: enteral nutrition and glycemic control to manage metabolic acidosis.
5. Prophylactic measures: subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Code status: DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).
7. Disposition: ICU-level care, with ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's complex medical conditions."
