   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA:
   Dx: Etiology unclear. Leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin.
   Infectious causes generally ruled out with negative cultures, CXR.
   Right foot remains possible source of infection.
   - Continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as
   D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - recheck evening lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: New onset this AM after exam. Abdomen benign.
   - DDx includes gastroparesis, anxiety. LFTs, amylase, lipase WNL.
   - pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
   improving with IVF.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above, check urine lytes
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   - Avoiding BB to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine
   - SW consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   - continue SC sugar control
   - diabetic diet
   - teaching re insulin
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction. Tolerated fluid
   resuscitation without hypoxia or dyspnea
   - Ruled out for MI, had previously had NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and
   DKA
   - Hold BB (in setting of active cocaine) and lisinopril as above
   - Continue ASA
   - Recheck echo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) following a recent right femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 133/73 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft abdomen with tenderness periumbilically, bowel sounds present, and no rebound or guarding. Her extremities show a left below-knee amputation, with a warm and well-perfused stump. Her right foot has absent pulses, coolness, and dry gangrene.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.2-15.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Creatinine: 2.9-1.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 437-71 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely due to non-compliance with insulin, and she will continue to receive aggressive maintenance fluids, including sugar replacement, and advance her diet as tolerated.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to gastroparesis, anxiety, or other causes, and she will be managed with pain medication and further evaluation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF is likely due to profound dehydration, and she will continue to receive aggressive volume resuscitation and nephrocaps.
4. Cocaine abuse: The patient's urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, and she will be managed with avoidance of beta-blockers to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine.
5. Type 1 diabetes: The patient will continue to receive sliding-scale and fixed-dose insulin, as well as diabetic diet and teaching on insulin management.
6. CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction: The patient will continue to receive ASA and hold BB and lisinopril due to active cocaine use.
7. Chronic pain: The patient will continue to receive oxycodone once her blood pressure is stable and her mental status clears.
8. Anxiety/depression: The patient will restart her home regimen of ativan and clonazepam once her mental status clears.
9. Chronic anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and she will continue to receive IVF.
10. Hepatitis B: The patient's hepatitis B is stable, and there are no active issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's renal function
* Development of sepsis or other infections
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events due to cocaine use
* Further worsening of the patient's mental status due to underlying conditions or medication side effects
* Development of gastrointestinal complications due to gastroparesis or other causes
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction or other coagulopathy

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.

   add the following points: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 F with Type 1 DM and severe
   PVD. She is admitted to the MICU for DKA. Her tox screen is also
   positive for cocaine.
   Exam notable for Tm 96 F BP 97/60 HR 78 RR 10-16/min. Labs notable for
   HCO3 11 and venous pH 7.15. Pt is difficult to arouse, heart with RR,
   no gallops/rubs/murmurs. Lung sounds are clear. Abd is soft and
   nontender. Agree with plan to continue fluids and IV insulin and follow
   anion gap.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill due to acidosis and hyperglycemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and potential sources of infection.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids to correct dehydration and hyperglycemia. Insulin infusion is initiated at 5-6 units/hour to normalize blood sugar levels and close the anion gap. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored due to her history of bisystolic dysfunction.

The patient's leukocytosis may be due to hemoconcentration or a real infection, and the source is unclear. The patient's gangrenous right foot is a potential source of infection, and blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow-up CXR are recommended.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to profound dehydration, and aggressive volume resuscitation will continue. Renal dosing of medications will also be implemented.

The patient's cocaine abuse is a significant concern, and her home regimen of metoprolol will be held. The patient's type 1 diabetes will be managed with insulin therapy, and her chronic pain and anxiety/depression will be addressed once her blood pressure is stable and her mental status clears.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's gangrenous right foot is a potential source of infection, and the patient's leukocytosis may be due to a real infection. Blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow-up CXR are recommended to monitor for signs of infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's bisystolic dysfunction and history of cocaine abuse increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of cocaine abuse increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of cocaine abuse and use of opioids increases her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids to correct dehydration and hyperglycemia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely due to her history of bisystolic dysfunction.
3. Continue insulin infusion to normalize blood sugar levels and close the anion gap.
4. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and source of infection.
5. Implement renal dosing of medications to prevent acute kidney injury.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely due to her history of cocaine abuse and bisystolic dysfunction.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely due to her altered mental status and history of cocaine abuse.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely due to her history of cocaine abuse and use of opioids."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears

   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 F with Type 1 DM and severe
   PVD. She is admitted to the MICU for DKA. Her tox screen is also
   positive for cocaine.
   Exam notable for Tm 96 F BP 97/60 HR 78 RR 10-16/min. Labs notable for
   HCO3 11 and venous pH 7.15. Pt is difficult to arouse, heart with RR,
   no gallops/rubs/murmurs. Lung sounds are clear. Abd is soft and
   nontender. Agree with plan to continue fluids and IV insulin and follow
   anion gap.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill due to acidosis and hyperglycemia.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

Patient: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**], a 38-year-old female with type 1 DM, severe PVD, and cocaine abuse, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

24-hour events:

* The patient received liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS) and insulin infusion at 5-6 units/hr.
* The patient's blood sugar levels were monitored, and insulin infusion was adjusted accordingly.
* The patient's leukocytosis was monitored, and blood and urine cultures were sent.
* The patient's ARF was managed with continued aggressive volume resuscitation.

Assessment and Plan:

* DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs. infection.
* Leukocytosis: may be real or a result of hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.
* ARF: likely a result of profound dehydration, as evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
* Cocaine abuse: urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, and the patient's prior OMR notes indicate ongoing problem.
* Type 1 DM: managed with insulin infusion and home regimen once stabilized.
* CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction: monitored closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia.
* Chronic pain: continued home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and mental status clears.
* Anxiety/depression: continued home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure is stable, and mental status clears.
* Chronic anemia: monitored with daily labs.
* Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
* PVD: will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: given the patient's positive urine tox screen for cocaine, there is a risk of sepsis, particularly in the setting of gangrenous right foot.
2. Cardiac complications: given the patient's history of CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction, there is a risk of cardiac complications, such as hypoxia, during volume resuscitation.
3. Respiratory failure: given the patient's history of bisystolic dysfunction, there is a risk of respiratory failure during volume resuscitation.
4. Infection: given the patient's positive urine tox screen for cocaine, there is a risk of infection, particularly in the setting of gangrenous right foot.
5. Renal failure: given the patient's history of ARF, there is a risk of further renal failure if the patient's volume resuscitation is not managed properly.
6. Neurological complications: given the patient's altered mental status, there is a risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, during the course of treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions, including DKA, ARF, and CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction, to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's condition has been unstable, with a gap in her insulin therapy leading to DKA, which was successfully closed with the restart of insulin and repletion of electrolytes. The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to DKA, and her hypertension is being managed with captopril. Tachycardia is attributed to hypovolemia and pain.

The patient has acute renal failure, which has resolved, and her cardiac status is stable, with a history of chronic pain and CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction. She has a history of hepatitis B and chronic anemia, which are stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Further deterioration of her renal function due to inadequate insulin therapy or electrolyte imbalance.
2. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy or lack of glucose control.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, due to her CAD and history of NSTEMI.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to her history of cocaine abuse and possible aspiration.
5. Infections, such as sepsis or wound infections, due to her history of cocaine abuse and compromised immune function.
6. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to her history of cocaine abuse and possible cerebral vasospasm.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bowel obstruction, due to her history of cocaine abuse and possible gastrointestinal damage.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her safe and effective management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA:
   Dx: Etiology unclear. Leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin.
   Infectious causes generally ruled out with negative cultures, CXR.
   Right foot remains possible source of infection.
   - Continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as
   D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - recheck evening lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: New onset this AM after exam. Abdomen benign.
   - DDx includes gastroparesis, anxiety. LFTs, amylase, lipase WNL.
   - pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
   improving with IVF.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above, check urine lytes
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   - Avoiding BB to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine
   - SW consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   - continue SC sugar control
   - diabetic diet
   - teaching re insulin
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction. Tolerated fluid
   resuscitation without hypoxia or dyspnea
   - Ruled out for MI, had previously had NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and
   DKA
   - Hold BB (in setting of active cocaine) and lisinopril as above
   - Continue ASA
   - Recheck echo
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   - restart home ativan and clonaxepam now that mental status cleared
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, improved to near baseline with IVF.

Summary:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of cocaine abuse, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She underwent a recent right femoral bypass surgery and has a history of chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, with a normal troponin T level. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 167/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely caused by noncompliance with insulin, and it is essential to continue aggressive maintenance fluids, including sugar replacement, to prevent hypoglycemia.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's ARF is likely a result of profound dehydration, and it is crucial to continue aggressive volume resuscitation and nephrocaps to improve renal function.
3. Cocaine Abuse: The patient's urine toxicology screen is positive for cocaine, and it is essential to avoid beta-blockers to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine.
4. Type 1 Diabetes: The patient's type 1 diabetes requires continued subcutaneous sugar control, diabetic diet, and teaching on insulin management.
5. CAD with Biventricular Systolic Dysfunction: The patient's cardiac condition requires continued ASA, and recheck echo is necessary to monitor cardiac function.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain requires continued management with home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and mental status clears.
7. Anxiety/Depression: The patient's anxiety and depression require continued management with home ativan and clonazepam once mental status clears.
8. PVD: The patient's PVD requires continued monitoring and management to prevent complications.
9. Hepatitis B: The patient's hepatitis B is stable, and no active issues are present.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN requires continued management with diabetic diet, maintenance fluids with D5 3amps of bicarb if not tolerating POs, and lytes prn.

The patient's medical condition is complex, and it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.
   - restarting insulin gtt

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient, a 38-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with DKA and abdominal pain.
* She has a history of type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) following recent right femoral bypass surgery, and cocaine abuse.
* The patient's DKA has been managed with insulin therapy, and the gap has been closed as of yesterday morning. However, the gap reopened overnight due to insufficient insulin dosing.
* The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to DKA, and her lipase levels are negative.
* The patient has acute renal failure, which has resolved, and her creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL.
* She has a history of cocaine abuse, and her blood pressure is elevated, requiring medication adjustments.
* The patient has tachycardia, likely due to hypovolemia and pain, and is being managed with metoprolol.
* She has chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, and is being treated with home medications.
* The patient has chronic anemia, which has improved with IV fluids.
* She has chronic hepatitis B, which is stable, and chronic PVD following recent surgery.
* The patient is not tolerating oral feeds and is receiving IV fluids and insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. DKA: If not properly managed, DKA can lead to severe metabolic acidosis, coma, and even death.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure if not properly managed.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may lead to complications such as opioid dependence or addiction if not properly managed.
7. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as suicidal ideation or attempts.
8. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or heart failure.
9. Chronic hepatitis B: The patient's chronic hepatitis B may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.
10. Chronic PVD: The patient's chronic PVD may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as limb ischemia, gangrene, or amputation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.
   - restarted SQ insulin
   - increased 75/25 20% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs, so AM is now 18u
   - will check AG again 2pm

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient, a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse, is currently in the ICU for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute renal failure, and hypovolemia.
* Her blood sugar levels are mostly within the normal range, but her gap has reopened due to insufficient insulin administration.
* She is receiving insulin therapy and has been restarted on SQ insulin.
* Her abdominal pain has resolved, and she is no longer experiencing nausea or vomiting.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 171/99 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.
* Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is not requiring supplemental oxygen.
* Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver function tests, but her creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, indicating resolution of acute renal failure.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* **Reopening of Gap:** The patient's gap has reopened due to insufficient insulin administration, which may lead to further complications if not addressed promptly.
* **Hypovolemia:** The patient's hypovolemia may persist if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
* **Acute Kidney Injury:** The patient's creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL indicates resolution of acute renal failure, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure that her kidney function remains stable.
* **Cocaine-Induced Complications:** The patient's history of cocaine abuse may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Infection:** The patient's history of diabetes and immunosuppression may increase her risk of infection, particularly in the setting of DKA and acute renal failure.
* **Chronic Pain:** The patient's chronic pain may persist, requiring ongoing management and treatment.

**Plan:**

* Continue insulin therapy and monitor blood sugar levels closely to prevent further reopening of the gap.
* Manage hypovolemia with IV fluids and monitor blood pressure and central venous pressure closely.
* Monitor kidney function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider antibiotic therapy for potential infections, particularly in the setting of DKA and acute renal failure.
* Continue to manage the patient's chronic pain with ongoing medication and therapy.
* Plan for discharge to the floor once the patient's blood sugar levels are stable and her medical condition is under control."
