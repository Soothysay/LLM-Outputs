You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main disease. She presented today with cardiac issues and is being transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) due to concerns about post-catheterization bleeding.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no signs of cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and no signs of respiratory distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 29.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 224 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 105 mg/dL.

The patient has a moderately large hematoma on her right groin, which is being closely monitored. She is being held for transfusion and will have serial exams and vital sign checks. Her cardiac catheterization showed patent grafts with no interventions performed.

The patient's medications include aspirin, statin, and levothyroxine. She is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Post-catheterization bleeding: The patient's hematoma is being closely monitored, and she is being held for transfusion. However, there is still a risk of bleeding, which can lead to cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed no signs of cardiac tamponade, but it is still a potential complication, especially given her history of CAD and CABG.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, but there is still a risk of cardiogenic shock, especially if she develops cardiac tamponade or bleeding.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is still a risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Infection: The patient's prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is in place, but there is still a risk of infection, especially given her recent surgical procedure and hospitalization.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bowel regimen is in place, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is not specifically mentioned in the progress note, but there is still a risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, especially given her history of CAD and CABG.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are still several potential medical complications that can arise. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease. She presented today for cardiac issues and is being transferred to the CCU due to concerns about post-cath bleeding.

The patient has a moderately large hematoma, as evident from the CT scan, with no RPB. Her HCT has dropped to 29.5, and her SBPs have decreased to the 80s. The patient is experiencing increasing abdominal pain, which is likely related to the ongoing bleeding. The plan is to:

* Administer IVF bolus 500cc, followed by 1L at 100cc/hr
* Hold Plavix as there is no stent in PCI
* Give one unit of RBCs, recheck HCT, and give another unit thereafter
* Monitor HCT every 6 hours
* Repeat CT scan STAT to assess for changes in hematoma size
* Conduct serial exams
* Call vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention
* Monitor vitals
* Hold beta-blocker

The patient has a history of CAD, and the cardiac cath showed patent grafts with no interventions performed. The plan is to continue aspirin and statin therapy.

The patient's rhythm is in sinus rhythm, and her EF is 60% on MIBI, which was performed last month. She is not currently in heart failure.

The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is being discharged to the CCU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding from the hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Development of cardiac tamponade due to bleeding into the pericardial space.
3. Pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary artery thrombosis.
4. Septicemia or sepsis due to infection, which could be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state.
5. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer or other gastrointestinal complications.
7. Worsening of the patient's underlying cardiac condition, such as cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
8. Development of kidney injury or failure due to hypovolemia, bleeding, or other factors.
9. Development of liver injury or failure due to hypovolemia, bleeding, or other factors.
10. Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances due to bleeding, hypovolemia, or other factors."

   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, and subsequently underwent surgical removal.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Low blood pressure in the 80s, treated with 2 units of PRBC and IVF, with pressures coming up to the 100s.
* Repeat abdominal CT/pelvis showed improvement in the size of the hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
* A 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery was detected via US, and a thrombus was seen in the right common femoral vein.
* The patient was taken to surgery overnight where the pseudoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
* She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.
* As her Hct decreased to 26, she was given 1 unit of PRBC overnight.

The patient's current status is:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.8°C, Tcurrent 37.7°C, HR 84 bpm, BP 98/50 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient is lying in bed in NAD, oriented x3, with a well-healed sternal wound. Her abdomen is soft in the upper abdomen, firm in the lower abdomen, with tenderness to palpation in the right groin. Her extremities are normal, with no femoral bruits.
* Lab results: Hct 26.3%, WBC 5.7 K/uL, Plt 224 K/uL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, Glucose 105 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm or hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
* Thrombosis of the right common femoral vein, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
* Infection at the surgical site, which could lead to sepsis.
* Development of a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, due to the patient's history of CAD and prior CABG.
* Development of a respiratory complication, such as pneumonia, due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions.
* Development of a gastrointestinal complication, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, due to the patient's age and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr.
* Holding Plavix as no stent in PCI.
* Giving one unit of RBCs, rechecking Hct, and giving another unit thereafter.
* Repeat CT STAT to assess for change in hematoma size.
* Serial exams.
* Call Vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention.
* Monitor vitals.
* Holding beta-blocker until Hct have stabilized.
* Continue aspirin and statin.
* Continue levothyroxine.
* Cardiac diet.
* DVT ppx with pneumatic boots.
* Pain management with tylenol PRN.
* Bowel regimen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease. She developed post-cath bleeding and was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery. The pseudoaneurysm was removed surgically, and the patient was started on a heparin gtt for thrombus in the right common femoral vein. She received 3 units of PRBC yesterday and her Hct increased from 26.3 to 29.7 after receiving a unit of blood overnight. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to her history of pseudoaneurysm and recent surgery. Close monitoring of her vital signs and hemodynamic status is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has a thrombus in the right common femoral vein, which may increase her risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to her surgical procedure and presence of foreign bodies (e.g., central lines, drains).
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and close monitoring of her thyroid function is necessary to prevent complications.
6. DVT and PE: The patient is at risk of developing DVT and PE due to her history of pseudoaneurysm and recent surgery. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic boots and heparin gtt are necessary to prevent these complications.
7. Bowel obstruction: The patient is at risk of developing bowel obstruction due to her recent surgery and presence of foreign bodies (e.g., central lines, drains).
8. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or respiratory failure due to her recent surgery and presence of foreign bodies (e.g., central lines, drains)."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   .
   # HEMATOMA:  CT showed moderately large hematoma with no RPB.  Pt. w/
   dropping SBPs into 80s w/ HCT down to 29.5.  Likely continuing to bleed
   given dropping HCT and increasing abdominal pain on exam, although no
   visible extension of hematoma.
   - IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr now
   - Will hold Plavix as no stent in PCI
   - Will give one unit of RBCs, recheck HCT and give another unit
   thereafter.
   - HCT Q6H
   - Repeat CT STAT to assess for change in hematoma size.
   - Serial exams
   - Call Vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention.
   - Monitor vitals
   - Holding b-blocker
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath today which showed patent grafts with no
   interventions performed.
   - Continue with aspirin, statin
   - Will hold beta-blocker
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease and is currently being transferred to the CCU due to concerns about post-cath bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/50 mmHg. She is receiving IVF and has a hematocrit of 32%. The patient has a moderately large hematoma in the right groin, which is not extending and has minimal change.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 32.9%
* Platelet count: 224 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 10 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* No signs of cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion
* No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Soft abdomen with a palpable hematoma in the right groin
* No peripheral edema or jugular venous distension

The patient's plan includes:

* IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr
* Holding Plavix due to no stent in PCI
* Giving one unit of RBCs, rechecking HCT, and giving another unit thereafter
* Repeat CT scan to assess for change in hematoma size
* Serial exams
* Call vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention
* Monitor vitals
* Holding beta-blocker

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding from the hematoma
* Development of cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion
* Septicemia or sepsis due to potential bacterial contamination of the hematoma
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility
* Hypovolemic shock or cardiac failure due to blood loss
* Infection or abscess formation at the site of the hematoma

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to detect any potential complications and adjust the plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease, who underwent a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery and underwent surgical removal. The patient received 3 units of PRBC yesterday and is currently on heparin gtt for thrombus in the common right femoral vein. Her hemoglobin level has increased from 26.3 to 29.7 after receiving blood transfusions.

Physical Examination:

The patient is lying in bed, oriented x3, with a stable vital sign, including a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 109/51 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. She has a tender groin with a blood-soaked bandage, and a well-healed sternal wound.

Lab Results:

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.7, hemoglobin level of 21.5%, and a platelet count of 70,000. Her creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 105 mg/dL. Her PT/PTT/INR levels are 13.1/58.2/1.1, respectively.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is at risk for developing medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of post-cath bleeding and has received blood transfusions. She is at risk for bleeding due to her low platelet count and her history of bleeding.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has a thrombus in the common right femoral vein, which may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Infection: The patient has a history of cardiac catheterization and may be at risk for developing an infection, particularly if her wounds are not properly cared for.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG. She is at risk for developing cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated for hypothyroidism and may be at risk for developing complications related to this condition, including decreased cardiac function or decreased mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's history of post-cath bleeding and her low platelet count may increase her risk of developing hemorrhagic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's thrombus in the common right femoral vein may increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and her current cardiac status may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Heart failure: The patient's history of CAD and her current cardiac status may increase her risk of developing heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of cardiac catheterization and her current wound status may increase her risk of developing an infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female who underwent vascular repair of a pseudoaneurysm on [**2198-11-24**]. She was found to have thrombus in the right common femoral vein on ultrasound. Despite heparin infusion, she continued to ooze from the operative site, leading to a drop in her hemoglobin count. She is currently receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells and will be monitored with serial hemoglobin counts. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/51 mmHg. She is in sinus rhythm and has a hematoma with minimal change.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's continued oozing from the operative site and low hemoglobin count suggest a risk of bleeding, which could worsen her anemia and lead to further complications.
2. Thrombosis: The presence of thrombus in the right common femoral vein may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
3. Infection: The patient's operative site is at risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and further complications.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's drop in hemoglobin count and ongoing bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock, which could be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior CABG surgery puts her at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's history of severe LM disease and prior CABG surgery may increase her risk for renal failure, particularly if she develops acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia or bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin infusion to prevent further thrombus formation.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin count and hematocrit levels closely to ensure that they do not drop further.
3. Consider transfusing additional units of packed red blood cells if the patient's hemoglobin count remains low.
4. Monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely to detect any signs of bleeding or hypovolemic shock.
5. Consider consulting with a vascular surgeon to assess the patient's operative site and determine the best course of treatment.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, particularly her heart rate and blood pressure, to detect any signs of cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease, who underwent a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed.

The patient has a hematoma in the space of Retzius associated with a femoral vascular catheter, with increased retroperitoneal component and extension into the right inguinal region. She has a right femoral DVT and has been placed on an IVC filter.

The patient has received a total of 6 units of blood products, with a current hematocrit of 30.1. She has been off heparin and Plavix due to bleeding concerns, but her hematocrit has stabilized.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 162 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine is 0.5 mg/dL, and her glucose is 105 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a large hematoma in the right groin, with extension into the lower pelvis and to the midline. Her right thigh is significantly swollen, but the swelling has not changed since yesterday.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm or hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock or organ failure.
2. Development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's IVC filter and right femoral DVT.
3. Increased risk of IVC thrombosis due to the IVC filter.
4. Hypothyroidism due to the patient's history of hypothyroidism and ongoing levothyroxine therapy.
5. Cardiac complications, such as apical ischemia or hypokinetic septum, which could lead to cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could be exacerbated by the patient's underlying CAD and recent cardiac catheterization.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hematocrit and bleeding status closely.
2. Consider restarting heparin or other anticoagulant therapy once the patient's bleeding has definitively stopped.
3. Monitor the patient's DVT and IVC filter for signs of thrombosis or embolism.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with levothyroxine therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely for signs of cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
6. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent respiratory infections.
7. Continue to provide pain management and bowel regimen as needed.
8. Consider transferring the patient to the floor once her hematocrit is stable and she is able to tolerate a regular diet."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the ICU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed. The patient developed a large hematoma in the right groin area with extension into the retroperitoneum and thigh, and was diagnosed with a DVT in the right femoral vein. She received a total of 6 units of blood transfusions and was stabilized with an HCT of 30.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.6°C, HR 76 bpm, BP 113/58 mmHg, RR 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%.
* Physical examination: The patient is lying in bed in NAD, oriented x3, with a mood and affect appropriate. She has a large hematoma in the right groin area with extension into the retroperitoneum and thigh, and a DVT in the right femoral vein.
* Laboratory results: HCT 30.4%, WBC 6.1, Plt 162, Cr 0.5 mg/dL, Glucose 105 mg/dL, and other labs are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hematoma expansion: The patient's hematoma is large and has extended into the retroperitoneum and thigh, which increases the risk of further expansion and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
2. DVT progression: The patient has a DVT in the right femoral vein, which can progress and potentially lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
3. IVC thrombosis: The patient has an IVC filter in place, which increases the risk of IVC thrombosis, especially if the bleeding has not definitively stopped.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has a large wound in the right groin area, which increases the risk of infection, especially with the presence of a hematoma and DVT.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient's Cr level is 0.5 mg/dL, which may indicate renal insufficiency, especially with the presence of a large hematoma and DVT.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, which increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended to:

* Monitor the patient's HCT and vital signs closely for any signs of bleeding or hematoma expansion.
* Continue to monitor the patient's DVT and IVC filter for any signs of progression or thrombosis.
* Consider restarting beta-blocker therapy if the patient's HCT is stable and SBP > 100 mmHg.
* Continue aspirin and statin therapy to prevent cardiovascular complications.
* Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin or warfarin to prevent DVT progression and IVC thrombosis.
* Monitor the patient's wound and hematoma for any signs of infection or expansion.
* Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Consider respiratory support and monitoring if the patient develops respiratory complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease, who underwent a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed.

The patient has been experiencing a hematoma on the right side, with a recent CT scan showing an increase in size, right iliac artery extension, and soft tissue gas in the right inguinal area. A DVT was also detected in the right femoral vein, for which heparin was discontinued and an IVC filter was inserted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac output of 4.7 L/min, with a pulmonary artery pressure of 15 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tender groin area with a bandage that is clean and dry, with no signs of active bleeding. Her extremities are normal, with no evidence of paresthesias or pulses.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 21.3 g/dL, a hematocrit of 30.1%, and a platelet count of 162 x 10^9/L. Her blood chemistry results are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated creatinine level.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, s/p CABG, and a history of pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the groin site and the presence of a pseudoaneurysm increase the risk of hemorrhage.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's DVT and the presence of a thrombus in the common right femoral vein increase the risk of thrombosis.
3. Infection: The patient's surgical site and the presence of a foreign body (IVC filter) increase the risk of infection.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding and the presence of a pseudoaneurysm increase the risk of hypovolemic shock.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and s/p CABG increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include:

1. Continued monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters.
2. Regular assessments of the surgical site and the presence of any signs of bleeding or infection.
3. Administration of heparin to prevent thrombosis.
4. Monitoring of laboratory results, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count.
5. Regular communication with the patient and her family regarding her condition and treatment plan.
6. Consideration of vascular consult to evaluate for RP bleed and bleeding into the thigh.
7. Holding b-blocker until the patient's Hct is stable.
8. Continue aspirin and statin therapy.
9. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Continue to provide pain management with tylenol PRN and bowel regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the ICU due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed. The patient has been stabilized, with HCT values ranging from 29-30%. She has been ambulating and eating well, with no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or bleeding. However, she has tenderness at the right groin site.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.9°C, Tcurrent of 36.7°C, HR of 77 bpm, BP of 118/48 mmHg, RR of 16 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of DVT, which was treated with an IVC filter and heparin. However, due to ongoing bleeding, heparin and Plavix were discontinued. The patient is now off heparin and has an IVC filter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. IVC thrombosis: The patient is at higher risk of IVC thrombosis due to the IVC filter, which may require post-ICU anticoagulation.
2. Pseudoaneurysm recurrence: The patient has a history of pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which may recur if not properly managed.
3. DVT recurrence: The patient has a history of DVT, which may recur if not properly managed.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, which may increase her risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has a surgical wound at the right groin site, which may be at risk for infection.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, which may recur if not properly managed.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had continued bleeding on heparin yesterday so an IVC filter
   was placed and her heparin was stopped (she is now only on ASA).  She
   received a total of 4 units of PRBC yesterday.  Her Hct was stable this
   am and at 10 am as well as 8pm at 29.  Her metoprolol was restarted at
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was allowed to eat again.  Vascular removed her JP
   drain, no new recs otherweise.  Her foley was pulled.  Plan was for her
   to ambulate today and possibly be called out to the floor t/m if her
   hct remains stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.  HC stabilizing.
   # HEMATOMA/PSEUDOANEURYSM:  Patient is s/p repair of pseudoaneurysm
   from [**2198-11-24**], was started on heparin gtt for DVT with continued
   bleeding w/ some extension into retroperitoneum and thigh.  She had a
   IVC filter placed, Plavix was d/ced as was heparin.  HCT now stabilized
   after total of 6U at 30.
   - Dced Plavix as no stent
   - Repeat HCT at 1000, if  HCT stable, can monitor [**Hospital1 **].  Active T&S, 2
   large bore IVs
   - Appreciate vascular consult, will f/u recs.
   - Pt. may OOB to chair today.
   # DVT.  Right femoral DVT in post op setting.  Pt. off heparin now w/
   IVC filter.  This places her at higher risk of IVC thrombosis, but
   given uncertainty whether the bleeding has definitively stopped, will
   not anticoagulate now.
   - Pt. may require OP anticoagulation given IVC filter, this should be
   assessed post ICU setting once HCT is stable.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath which showed patent grafts and had a POBA to the
   distal LAD.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - Will restart beta-blocker 12.5BID low dose if HCT stable at 1000 and
   SBP > 100mmHg
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.
   # RHYTHM:  In sinus rhythm.
   # HYPOTHYRODISIM:  Continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  Cardiac diet, will d/c foley

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had continued bleeding on heparin yesterday so an IVC filter
   was placed and her heparin was stopped (she is now only on ASA).  She
   received a total of 4 units of PRBC yesterday.  Her Hct was stable this
   am and at 10 am as well as 8pm at 29.  Her metoprolol was restarted at
   12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was allowed to eat again.  Vascular removed her JP
   drain, no new recs otherweise.  Her foley was pulled.  Plan was for her
   to ambulate today and possibly be called out to the floor t/m if her
   hct remains stable.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of CAD, who underwent CABG for severe LM disease and is now being transferred to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She has a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was repaired surgically. The patient has continued bleeding, requiring 4 units of PRBC, and has an IVC filter in place. She is currently on ASA only and has a stable Hct. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and she is oriented x3 with no signs of distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma/Pseudoaneurysm: The patient's pseudoaneurysm has not definitively stopped bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding or expansion.
2. DVT: The patient has a right femoral DVT in the post-op setting, which increases her risk of IVC thrombosis.
3. IVC Filter-Related Complications: The IVC filter may cause complications such as IVC thrombosis, filter migration, or embolization.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known 3VD with prior CABG, which increases her risk of further cardiovascular events.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, which may require close monitoring.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of CAD and is taking medications that may increase her risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and hematoma/pseudoaneurysm for any signs of expansion or further bleeding.
2. Monitor the patient's DVT for any signs of progression or embolization.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's IVC filter for any signs of complications such as IVC thrombosis or filter migration.
4. Continue to manage the patient's coronary artery disease with medications and close monitoring.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and adjust her medication as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her medications as needed to prevent hypoglycemia.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide prophylaxis for respiratory complications as needed."
