   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen (note: only 2 of the
   lumens can be used)
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, will
   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   *************************************
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis vs. DKA. Serum tox
   negative. Patient does not take metformin as outpatient. Delta-delta
   1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   - Treat possible DKA: Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**], replete K > 3.3,
   follow-up serum ketones
   - Lactic Acidosis: repleted bicarb total 250 meq
   - Increase vent RR to compensate metabolic acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated.
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - For now attempt Lasix bolus and drip for diuresis
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Currently GS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation and
   cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -overall very poor prognosis
   -neuro team to follow, appreciate input
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab.
   - send urine lytes
   - renal to eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed.
   FEN: NPO
   .
   ACCESS: Femoral vein and arterial cath.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sq
   -Pain management with sedation
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace
   -Famotidine 20 mg IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a past medical history of DM, CVA, and PAD with stents. He presented with a cardiac arrest, STEMI, and was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. He was found to have an acute thrombus in the RCA, which was treated with a bare metal stent. He remains unstable and is being weaned off pressors and ventilator support.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac arrest and STEMI, with a PA saturation of 53% and PCWP of 33.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has patchy infiltrate on CXR, likely due to edema secondary to cardiogenic shock, and is intubated.
3. Neurological dysfunction: The patient has poor GCS and decorticate posturing, and is too unstable for a head CT scan.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion, and is not responsive to diuretic therapy.
5. Acid-base disorder: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation, likely due to lactate acidosis or DKA.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is affecting his bleeding risk.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling lines and catheters make him at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed promptly.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is already compromised, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy makes him at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines and catheters make him at risk for developing infections."

   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload

   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.

   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM,
   reported prior CVA s/p cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide
   complex perfusing rhythm. ED code STEMI was called for inferior STE and
   anterolateral ST depressions - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA
   s/p bare metal stent. Patient unstable in cath lab required multiple
   pressors, ballon pump and temp wire. Patient continues to be intubated,
   on pressors, with balloon pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Increase vent RR to help with metabolic acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   - f/u urine lytes

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Continued cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac arrest and STEMI
	* High filling pressures on right heart cath, indicating pulmonary edema
	* Acute RV infarct and RV dysfunction
	* Potential for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or cardiac failure
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to intubation and ventilation
	* Worsening pulmonary edema, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Respiratory acidosis due to inadequate compensation
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Continued status epilepticus, which can lead to further neurological damage or brain injury
	* Potential for further neurological decline or deterioration
	* Risk of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to cooling protocol
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	* Fluid overload, which can exacerbate cardiac and respiratory complications
	* Risk of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders
5. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and sympathetic stimulation
	* Risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS)
	* Potential for further metabolic acidosis or alkalosis due to changes in pH and electrolyte levels
6. Infectious Complications:
	* Risk of sepsis or septic shock due to invasive lines and catheters
	* Potential for further infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), or bloodstream infections
7. Hematological Complications:
	* Risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and coagulopathy
	* Potential for further hematological complications, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

These complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, including ongoing assessment of cardiac, respiratory, neurological, and metabolic status, as well as management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and prevention of infections and bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; being weaned on vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis; due to coagulopathy affects of
   cooling hold integrillin and plavix load due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean dopamine then epinephrine.
   - Wean epinephrine today, then dopamine as tolerated.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip, currently 0.5 mg/min
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   - Increase PEEP to 16 as PO2 on most recent gas 66
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed
   - f/u urine lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen (note: only 2 of the
   lumens can be used)
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, will
   reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run VT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and prior stroke. He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm. The patient has a STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral depressions, and a catheterization demonstrated acute thrombus in the right coronary artery (RCA) with chronic total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient has a history of poor memory and is taking medications for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and prostate cancer.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: The patient is in cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 2.4 L/min/m2 and a right atrial pressure of 33 mmHg. He has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. The patient is receiving multiple pressors, including dopamine, epinephrine, and vasopressin, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >50 mmHg.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on an FiO2 of 80%. He has a patchy infiltrate on his chest X-ray, consistent with pulmonary edema.
* Neurological: The patient has a poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and is experiencing non-convulsive status epilepticus, as evidenced by an EEG. He is being treated with keppra and midazolam.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. He is receiving a lasix drip and thiazide diuretic to manage fluid overload.
* Metabolic: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.25 and a bicarbonate level of 13 mEq/L. He is being treated with bicarbonate therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac:
	+ Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
	+ Cardiac arrest
	+ Cardiac failure
* Respiratory:
	+ Respiratory failure
	+ Pneumonia
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Neurological:
	+ Increased intracranial pressure
	+ Seizures
	+ Status epilepticus
* Renal:
	+ Chronic kidney disease
	+ Acute kidney injury
	+ Renal failure
* Metabolic:
	+ Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
	+ Lactic acidosis
	+ Metabolic acidosis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

   DISPO: CCU for now. Poor prognosis. Family meeting was yesterday; will
   follow-up today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old Russian-speaking male with a significant medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, prior stroke, and prostate cancer. He presented with cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated, and was found to have a STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral depressions. He was treated with balloon pump and temporary wire, and a bare metal stent was placed in the RCA.

The patient's current condition is critical, with cardiogenic shock, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a FiO2 of 80% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O. He is also on multiple pressors, including levophed, epinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin, to maintain a MAP of 50.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for an anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation, likely due to lactate acidosis. His serum lactate level is elevated, and he has a high anion gap, which is not fully compensated by his respiratory alkalosis. His serum potassium level is also elevated, and he has a high serum creatinine level, indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 on admission and decorticate posturing. He has a history of stroke and is currently being treated for non-convulsive status epilepticus.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Cardiac care: Continue balloon pump and pressors to maintain a MAP of 50. Consider cardioversion if he loses sinus rhythm.
2. Respiratory care: Continue mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 80% and PEEP of 14 cmH2O. Increase RR if needed to help with metabolic acidosis compensation.
3. Renal care: Continue lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output. Re-evaluate for CVVH for fluid overload.
4. Neurological care: Continue keppra and midazolam to treat non-convulsive status epilepticus. Consider EEG and cooling protocol.
5. Hyperglycemia management: Continue insulin drip to manage insulin resistance. Re-evaluate and adjust as needed.
6. Pain management: Continue sedation and pain management with senna, colace, and famotidine.
7. DVT prophylaxis: Continue heparin drip.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family has been informed of the critical nature of his condition. A family meeting was held yesterday, and follow-up will be provided today."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium, weaning off now slowly
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, and now
   making urine productively, will reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic yesterday
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run NSVT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest and STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) with inferior and anterolateral ST depressions. He was resuscitated to a wide complex perfusing rhythm and was found to have acute thrombus in the RCA (right coronary artery) with a bare metal stent. The patient is currently intubated and on pressors, with a balloon pump and temperature wire. He has been slowly weaned off vent and pressors.

The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and prostate cancer, and has had a prior CVA (cerebrovascular accident) with no residual deficits.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely secondary to unstable VTach (ventricular tachycardia) and RCA RV infarct.
* Respiratory distress: The patient has patchy infiltrate throughout his CXR (chest X-ray), likely due to edema secondary to cardiogenic shock.
* Neurological: The patient has poor GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) and decorticate posturing, and is being treated for status epilepticus with keppra and midazolam.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypoperfusion, and is being treated with lasix drip and thiazide diuretic.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has insulin resistance, which may be part of his overall ischemic state.
* Acid-base disorder: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate compensation, likely due to lactate acidosis.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

* Cardiac: The patient may experience further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory: The patient may experience further respiratory distress, such as worsening pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
* Neurological: The patient may experience further neurological decline, such as increased intracranial pressure or status epilepticus.
* Renal: The patient may experience further renal failure or need for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).
* Hyperglycemia: The patient may experience further hyperglycemia or insulin resistance.
* Acid-base disorder: The patient may experience further acid-base disturbances, such as metabolic alkalosis or respiratory acidosis.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base disorder and adjust therapy as needed.
* Consider further imaging studies, such as echocardiogram or head CT scan, to better understand the patient's cardiac and neurological status.
* Consider further therapy, such as anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents, to prevent further cardiac complications.
* Consider further therapy, such as diuretics or vasopressors, to manage the patient's cardiac and respiratory status.
* Consider further therapy, such as insulin or glucagon, to manage the patient's hyperglycemia.
* Consider further therapy, such as bicarbonate or lactate, to manage the patient's acid-base disorder."

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   Cardiac
   arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   -Patient being weaned slowly off all 4 pressors, and BP tolerating this
   thus far
   -No apparent change in mental status
   -Continues to be on ventilator
 with FiO2 being weaned down
   -Paralyzed with Vercuronium, weaning off now slowly
   -Per neuro: EEG c/w non-convulsive status epilepticus:  Keppra 2000mg
   loading, 1000mg IV bid; still seizing so midazolam bolus given in the
   afternoon, and then uptitrated midazolam (running at 8/hour as of
   930pm)
   -Leaving arterial and venous sheaths in groin for access; started on IV
   heparin; venous sheath converted to triple lumen
   -Per PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4562**]: Echo 2 years ago WNL (EF 60%); CVA in [**2183**] with
   no residual deficits; PAD with stents (popliteal, SFA); HTN;
   hyperlipidemia; no active coronary issues; borderline DM (not
   medication or insulin treated); prostate CA; complaints of poor memory.
   -Per renal: too unstable for CVVHD at this point in time, and now
   making urine productively, will reevaluate and follow closely
   -Repeatedly repleted K, phos, calcium, mg
   -Gave bicarb when very academic yesterday
   -Afib, then into sinus, multiple PVC
s or short run NSVT (decreased
   frequency of these as the night went on)
   -Continue insulin gtt, per endocrine; treating insulin resistance
   -Chlorothiazide 500mg once in the evening for goal of increased
   diuresis and concern for volume overload
   -Starting rewarming at 5AM
   -Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with
   global hypokinesis and regional inferior akinesis to the apex. No
   masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis
   is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year Russian speaking male with PMH DM, reported prior CVA s/p
   cardiac arrest (PEA). Resuscitated to wide complex perfusing rhythm. ED
   code STEMI was called for inferior STE and anterolateral ST depressions
   - cath demonstrated acute thrombus in RCA s/p bare metal stent. Patient
   unstable in cath lab required multiple pressors, ballon pump and temp
   wire. Patient continues to be intubated, on pressors, with balloon
   pump; slowly being weaned off vent and pressors.
   .
   # CORONARIES: STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral
   depressions. Cath demonstrated chronic totally occcluded LAD with
   collaterals, small circ and acute distally ocluded RCA. Patient is s/p
   bare metal stent RCA placement. R heart cath demonstrates RV infarct
   - ASA 325 mg qd and daily plavix 75 mg qd (patient was plavix loaded
   yesterday)
   - Patient post-cath with epitaxis (no more bleeding since); due to
   coagulopathy affects of cooling hold integrillin due to risk > benefit
   - Pressor support to maintain MAP >50
   .
   # PUMP: Patient currently in cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac
   arrest and STEMI. Extremities cool (prior to artic sun), PA sat 53%.
   PCWP 33. EF: 25%.
   - Currently on levophed, epinephrine, dopamine and vasopressin. Goal
   MAP 50, attempt to wean pressors.
   - Continue ballon pump; on heparin gtt
   - Limit fluid intake
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload, goal 2-3L off as
   tolerated
   - Continue with lasix drip; additional diuresis as tolerated with loop
   or thiazide diuretic
   .
   # RHYTHM: Hx of PEA and V Tach s/p temp wire. Was in afib, currently
   appears to be in sinus rhythm.
   - D/C amiodorane drip now, (currently 0.5 mg/min)
   - Initiate Amiodarone po 400mg tid
   - Consider cardioversion if loses sinus rhythm
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest: Most likely secondary to unstable V Tach and RCA RV
   infarct.
   - Artic sun cooling protocol
 now in warming phase
   - For treatment of underlying causes [**Last Name 435**] problem list.
   .
   # Acid-Base disorder: Anion gap (20) metabolic acidosis with inadequate
   compensation initially. Etiology most likely lactate acidosis. Serum
   tox negative. Patient does not take diabetes medications as outpatient,
   per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 9217**] was 1.5 suggesting pure AG metabolic acidosis.
   This morning, most recent ABG: 7.25/33/91/-[**12-7**]. Acidemic
 metabolic
   acidosis, respiratory compensation via Winter
s Formula should put the
   pCO2 at between 26 and 30, so see inadequate compensation as some CO2
   still being retained. Serum ketones negative so less concerning picture
   for DKA.
   - Lactic Acidosis: replete bicarb as needed, based upon acid/base
   status as it fluctuates throughout the day
   - Maintain vent settings, increase RR if needed to help with metabolic
   acidosis compensation; ok to have slight lack of full respiratory
   compensation, as part of ARDSnet protocol for ventilation
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Patchy infiltrate throughout CXR, most likely
   edema secondary to cardiogenic shock demonstrated by high filling
   pressures on right heart cath. Patient is intubated. Patient net
   positive yesterday so concern for worsening pulmonary edema.
   - repeat CXR this AM
   - ARDSnet tidal volumes
   - Paralytics while ventilated for now, decreasing as tolerated
   - Follow-up ABG closely and adjust vent settings as needed
   - Increase peep to improve oxygenation (from 14 to 16 this morning)
   - Renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip and extra diuresis as tolerated to increase urine output
   - Sedation versed and fentanyl
   .
   # Neuro: Pt with poor GCS on admission and decorticate posturing.
   Yesterday morning, GCS 3. Neurology unable to assess MS due to sedation
   and cooling. Of note patient too unstable to have head CT scan prior to
   cath and does have prior history of stroke. Neuro feels status
   epilepticus is occurring, based on EEG. Patient treated with keppra and
   midazolam thus far.
   -cooling blanket
   -EEG per cooling protocol
   -f/u neuro recs
   -continue keppra [**Hospital1 **]
 ask neuro about dose due to renal failure
   -continue midazolam
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Insulin resistance picture could be part of
   sympathomimetic treatment plus overall ischemic state. Serum ketones
   negative, so DKA less likely.
   - Insulin drip [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec
s, replete K > 3.3 (but on hold now
   during warming stage of Arctic sun)
   - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72**] rec
s today
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Prior baseline 0.9 creatinine. Acute renal
   failure most likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Pt not responsive to
   160 mg bolus of lasix given in cath lab. Responded to lasix drip and
   thiazide diuretic with urine output yesterday and overnight.
   - renal to re-eval for CVVH for fluid overload
   - Lasix drip continue
   - renal dose all meds
   - follow-up lytes q6hr, replete as needed

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan.   I was present during the entire portion of the
   physical examination.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 77 year old man who suffered an inferior wall STEMI
   complicated by cardiogenic shock earlier this AM.  He was treated with
   PCI using a BMS in the distal RCA following thrombectomy with the
   support of a pacemaker and IABP.
   He was cooled for 24 hours for neuro protection and is now warm.  There
   has been no return in her neurologic function.  His IABP was removed
   for leg leg ischemia and he is currently on reduced pressor
   requirements.  This resulted in a doppler left popliteal and faint PT
   pulse. He is urinating > 100 cc clear urine per hour.
   We have continued all aggressive supportive care until his prognosis in
   better defined tomorrow.
   His prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain and this has
   been discussed with his wife and family.

   on:[**2194-10-28**] 20:14 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* Patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, prior CVA, and cardiac arrest.
* He is currently intubated and on pressors, with a balloon pump in place.
* He has a STEMI with inferior elevations and anterior lateral depressions, and has undergone PCI with a bare metal stent in the distal RCA.
* He is experiencing cardiogenic shock, with a cardiac index of 1.9 L/min/m2 and a PCWP of 33 mmHg.
* He has a poor neurological status, with a GCS of 3 and decorticate posturing.
* He is experiencing acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.
* He has a hyperglycemic state, with a blood glucose level of 224 mg/dL.
* He has a metabolic acidosis, with an anion gap of 20 and a pH of 7.25.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest history put him at risk for recurrent cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation put him at risk for respiratory failure.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure and need for dialysis put him at risk for further kidney damage.
* Neurological Complications: The patient's poor neurological status and history of stroke put him at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or brain edema.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and need for invasive lines and devices put him at risk for infection.
* Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and need for enteral nutrition put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation.
* Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock and need for pressors put him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac rupture.

**Treatment Plan:**

* Continue aggressive supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, pressors, and dialysis.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further interventions, such as EEG monitoring or neuroprotection protocols.
* Continue to manage the patient's hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, and consider further interventions, such as insulin therapy or bicarbonate administration.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or cardiac surgery.
* Consider further interventions, such as antibiotics or antifungals, to prevent infection.
* Consider further interventions, such as anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy, to prevent cardiovascular complications.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is poor, and further medical complications are likely. Close monitoring and aggressive supportive care are necessary to manage the patient's condition and prevent further complications."
