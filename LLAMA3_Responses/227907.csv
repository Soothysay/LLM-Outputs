   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 832**] is a 52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   .
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   .
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   .
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   .
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   .
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   .
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   .
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and hypotension. He was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, which is attributed to possible hypovolemia, sepsis, or adrenal insufficiency. He has a history of blood loss, but his hematocrit has stabilized, making blood loss less likely. Blood cultures showed coag-negative staph, but it is likely a contaminant. The patient's cancer has been refractory to all therapies, and he has metastases to bone and liver.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Despite the patient's lack of fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea, sepsis cannot be completely ruled out, especially with a positive blood culture.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's hypotension could lead to hemorrhagic shock, which would require immediate attention and treatment.
4. Metastatic Disease Progression: The patient's metastatic prostate cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture may indicate an underlying infection, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to further complications and decreased liver function.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and radiation cystitis may lead to respiratory failure, especially with further deterioration of his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue stress-dose steroids to help manage the patient's hypotension.
3. Re-evaluate the patient's blood cultures and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 832**] is a 52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic,
   oso sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Taper stress dose steroids
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On antibiotics --> vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive
   blood cultures likely present contamination.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   .
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and hypotension. He has undergone various treatments, including radiation therapy, and has developed several complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may indicate bacteremia. This could lead to sepsis, particularly in the setting of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to adrenal insufficiency, which could be exacerbated by the use of corticosteroids.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen if not addressed, potentially leading to bleeding complications or increased risk of infection.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) may indicate liver metastases, which could lead to liver failure or encephalopathy.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic pain and use of opioids may increase the risk of respiratory depression, particularly if not properly monitored.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer on his left ischial area may worsen if not properly managed, potentially leading to deep tissue injury or infection.
7. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and neutropenia may increase the risk of infection, particularly if not properly treated with antibiotics.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if not properly managed with transfusions.
9. Organ dysfunction: The patient's metastatic prostate cancer may lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver, kidneys, or bones.
10. Poor wound healing: The patient's radiation cystitis and anemia may impair wound healing, potentially leading to delayed or poor wound healing.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing these potential complications, including:

* Transfusing blood products to address anemia and thrombocytopenia
* Administering antibiotics to treat bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adrenal insufficiency
* Managing liver dysfunction with lactulose and repeat LFTs
* Monitoring respiratory function and adjusting pain management as needed
* Managing pressure ulcers with proper wound care and dressings
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed
* Managing bleeding complications with transfusions and platelet support
* Monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and addressing any issues promptly
* Managing poor wound healing with proper wound care and dressings."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 832**] is a 52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic,
   oso sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Taper stress dose steroids
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On antibiotics --> vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive
   blood cultures likely present contamination.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   .
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]

   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - transfuse to hct goal > 25
   - transfuse plts goal > 20

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. His 24-hour events include the placement of a central venous line (CVL) and removal of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC), and initiation of hydrocortisone 50mg every 6 hours. His laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to his underlying cancer and bone metastases. He also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and leukopenia increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of his radiation cystitis.
3. Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs and liver metastases increase his risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
4. Infection: The patient's CNS bacteremia increases his risk of developing secondary infections, particularly in the lungs, urinary tract, and skin.
5. Organ failure: The patient's underlying cancer and bone metastases increase his risk of developing organ failure, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor nutritional status increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and prolonged hospitalization.
7. DVT/PE: The patient's immobility and underlying cancer increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to respiratory failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure, hemoglobin, and platelet count to ensure that they remain stable and do not worsen.
2. Consider administering antibiotics to treat the patient's CNS bacteremia and prevent secondary infections.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider administering lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Consider administering anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's nutrition and consider administering nutritional supplements to prevent malnutrition.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and consider administering insulin to prevent hyperglycemia.
7. Consider consulting with an oncologist to discuss the patient's treatment options and management of his underlying cancer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and recent admission to the ICU with hypotension. He was initially treated for hypovolemic shock and received a 2.5L bolus, which improved his blood pressure. He was also treated for presumed septic shock with antibiotics, including vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci, and he has been receiving IV hydrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 98/43 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has been receiving respiratory support, including oxygen therapy, and has a fine crackle in his lung bases. His neurological examination is normal, but his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, which are likely related to his underlying disease. His coagulation studies show a prolonged PT and PTT, and his fibrinogen level is low.

Potential medical complications:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors may be related to adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be addressed with stress dose steroids.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and presumed septic shock increase his risk of developing sepsis, which needs to be monitored closely.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to a production problem or DIC, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to chronic disease, dilutional anemia, or decreased production, which needs to be evaluated and treated accordingly.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may be related to his underlying disease, which needs to be monitored closely.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT, and low fibrinogen level, increase his risk of bleeding, which needs to be monitored closely.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and fine crackles in his lung bases increase his risk of respiratory failure, which needs to be monitored closely.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's underlying disease and recent ICU admission increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, which need to be monitored closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

He was readmitted with hypotension to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 70s and was found to have positive blood cultures with Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and presumed to have septic shock.

The patient received a 2.5L bolus with improvement in blood pressure, but had two episodes of brief SBP to 80s and required another 1.5L fluid resuscitation. An arterial line was placed for continued hemodynamic monitoring.

The patient has a history of bilateral LE DVT, history of PE, and is on IV filter. He also has a history of duodenal ulcer and OSA.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Sepsis with GP bacteremia from line infection, currently on vancomycin and zosyn, and will continue vancomycin until culture data is confirmed.
2. Endocrine: On dexamethasone chronically for pain control, will place on stress dose steroids in the short term, and follow-up cortisol stimulation test.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Possibly related to DIC and production problem in setting of bony mets.
4. Anemia: Chronic anemia related to malignancy, no signs of active bleeding.
5. Elevated liver enzymes: Likely due to mets.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient has already developed septic shock, and further complications can occur if the infection is not properly managed.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of radiation cystitis and sepsis increases the risk of adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and other complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if he requires invasive procedures or has a traumatic event.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, particularly if he has underlying cardiovascular disease.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or failure, which can lead to jaundice, coagulopathy, and other complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of radiation cystitis and sepsis increases the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of radiation cystitis and sepsis increases the risk of renal failure, particularly if he develops acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of blood loss, but his hematocrit has stabilized, making blood loss unlikely as the cause of hypotension. He has positive blood cultures for coag-negative staph, but this is likely due to contamination. The patient is not febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, making sepsis unlikely. He has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, likely secondary to bone metastases.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Although the patient does not currently meet criteria for sepsis, the positive blood cultures and potential contamination may lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, and other complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
5. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may increase the risk of infection and make it difficult to mount an adequate immune response.
6. Radiation Cystitis: The patient's history of radiation cystitis may lead to ongoing bladder dysfunction and potential complications.
7. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer may progress to a deeper stage if not properly managed.
8. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain may require ongoing management to prevent complications and improve quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
2. Manage the patient's hypotension with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Manage the patient's radiation cystitis with ongoing bladder care and pain management.
7. Manage the patient's pressure ulcer with regular dressing changes and pressure relief measures.
8. Continue to manage the patient's chronic pain with ongoing medication and interventional procedures as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, which are likely secondary to bone metastases. He has also been experiencing altered mental status, which is suspected to be caused by hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which are likely due to liver metastases. His coagulation panel shows a prolonged PT and PTT, which may be related to liver dysfunction or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, but they were discontinued due to negative blood cultures. He has also been receiving steroids, which are being tapered.

The patient's physical examination reveals a lethargic mental status, scleral icterus, and a soft, distended abdomen. He has 1+ pitting edema bilaterally and pneumatic compression boots in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Despite the negative blood cultures, the patient's hypotension and altered mental status may be indicative of sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of pathogens.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated LFTs and altered mental status suggest that he may be experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed promptly.
3. DIC: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may indicate DIC, which can be caused by various underlying conditions, including liver dysfunction, sepsis, or disseminated cancer.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and metastatic cancer make him susceptible to infection, which could be caused by a variety of pathogens.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory status may be compromised due to his underlying cancer and treatment, which could increase his risk of respiratory failure or pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrhythmias.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.

   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old male, is a repeat admission to the ICU for hypotension, which is attributed to possible hypovolemia, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. He has a history of metastatic prostate cancer, which is refractory to all therapies. He has been transfused with 1u PRBC and is receiving stress dose steroids. His blood cultures are positive for coag-negative staph, but it is likely a contamination. He is also experiencing leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are thought to be secondary to bone metastases. He has elevated liver function tests, likely due to liver metastases.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Despite the patient not being febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, there is a risk of sepsis given the positive blood cultures.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver function tests and liver metastases may lead to liver failure, which requires close monitoring and potential treatment.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of DVT and IVC filter placement, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
6. Pressure Ulcer Progression: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer requires close monitoring and potential treatment to prevent progression.
7. Worsening of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The patient's metastatic prostate cancer may worsen, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP overnight.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9. Last
   transfused on [**10-24**] 1u PRBC. Hypotension unlikely to be secondary to
   blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures from [**10-24**]
   positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely representing
   contamination.  He has not been febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, so
   sepsis is unlikely.  Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC.
   - Continue stress dose steroids.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - On vanco and pip/tazo, which can be held as positive blood cultures
   likely present contamination.  Will restart if patient develops signs
   or symptoms of infection.
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of
   dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer.
   - Transfuse 1u PRBC as above
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - cont oxybutinin
   - cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old male, is a readmission to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of metastatic prostate cancer and has undergone various treatments. His current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension, with a blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg
* Lethargy during the day
* Scleral icterus and elevated liver enzymes, suggesting liver dysfunction
* Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, likely secondary to bone metastases
* Positive blood cultures for coag-negative staph, but likely representing contamination
* No fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea, making sepsis unlikely
* Elevated liver function tests, likely due to liver metastases

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Although the patient is not febrile, tachycardic, or tachypneic, sepsis cannot be ruled out completely. The patient's hypotension, lethargy, and elevated liver enzymes may be indicative of sepsis.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and he has liver metastases. This may lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of infection.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may increase the risk of infection and make it challenging to manage his cancer.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on his left ischial area, which may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen, which can affect his overall well-being and quality of life.
7. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may not be adequately controlled, which can lead to decreased quality of life and increased risk of complications.
8. Radiation cystitis: The patient's radiation cystitis may worsen, leading to urinary tract complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, and oxygen saturation closely.
2. Continue stress dose steroids and follow-up cultures to rule out sepsis.
3. Reintroduce the patient's home pain regimen and adjust as necessary.
4. Trend the patient's liver function tests and anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
6. Monitor the patient's pressure ulcer and adjust dressing as necessary.
7. Continue depression and chronic pain management.
8. Consider consulting a palliative care team to optimize the patient's comfort and quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, recently admitted to the ICU with hypovolemic shock related to significant GU bleeding from radiation cystitis. He has been treated with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and his blood pressure has improved. However, he continues to have septicemia with positive blood cultures and is at risk for further complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's septicemia and positive blood cultures indicate a high risk of septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. **Adrenal Insufficiency:** The patient's history of chronic steroid use and recent stress dose hydrocortisone may indicate adrenal insufficiency, which can exacerbate shock and other complications.
3. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of radiation cystitis.
4. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be related to chronic disease, bleeding, or dilutional anemia, which can exacerbate his already compromised cardiovascular status.
5. **Elevated Liver Enzymes:** The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver metastases or other liver damage, which can lead to further complications.
6. **Respiratory Complications:** The patient's history of OSA and bilateral LE DVT may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's positive blood cultures and septicemia may indicate a high risk of further infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or other bacterial or fungal infections.
8. **Catheter-Related Complications:** The patient's new right IJ line may increase his risk of catheter-related complications, such as infection, thrombosis, or embolism.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, radiation cystitis, and recent admission to the ICU for hypovolemic shock and suspected CNS bacteremia. He has received 2.5L fluid resuscitation and has improved blood pressure. He has developed positive blood cultures with GPCs, but only grew CNS in one of four bottles. He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has had two episodes of brief hypotension, which has been managed with fluid resuscitation. He has also had a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination is notable for lethargy, soft abdomen, and muscle wasting.

Lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, likely related to bone metastases and possibly DIC. Liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to metastases. Other labs show normal kidney function, electrolyte imbalance, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Despite the patient's improved blood pressure, he is still at risk for sepsis due to his positive blood cultures and suspected CNS bacteremia.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's shock may be due to adrenal insufficiency, and he should be monitored closely for signs of adrenal crisis.
3. Autonomic Dysfunction: The patient's chronic use of dexamethasone for pain control may have contributed to autonomic dysfunction, and he should be monitored for signs of autonomic instability.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be due to bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy, and he should be monitored for signs of bleeding or infection.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may be due to metastases, and he should be monitored for signs of liver failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be due to DIC, and he should be monitored for signs of bleeding or thrombosis.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he should be monitored for signs of respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension may be due to adrenal insufficiency or sepsis, and he should be monitored for signs of cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x72 hours. During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 29.1;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Concern is that patient is
   leukopenic at 1.4. Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for lethargy/confusion
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer. Stable overnight after given 1U pRBCs
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   - Given that hematocrit stable for 36 hours, will check only once daily
   now.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - Cont oxybutinin
   - Cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of blood loss, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency, but his current hypotension is uncertain in etiology. His hematocrit has improved from 24.9 to 29.1 after transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells. He is leukopenic with a WBC count of 1.4 and has elevated liver function tests, likely due to liver metastases. He is also experiencing altered mental status, which is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and/or pain medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Although the patient's blood cultures are negative, his leukopenia and altered mental status may indicate a septic process.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and decreased cortisol response to cosyntropic stimulation test suggest adrenal insufficiency, which may worsen his condition.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver function tests and altered mental status may indicate progression of liver metastases, which can lead to worsening encephalopathy.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the presence of liver metastases.
5. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer on his left ischial area may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Depression: The patient's severe depression may worsen if not addressed, which can impact his overall well-being and treatment outcomes.
7. Infection: The patient's history of coag-negative staph infection and his current leukopenia may indicate a risk of secondary infections.
8. Liver Failure: The patient's liver metastases may lead to liver failure, which can have severe consequences if not managed promptly.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's decreased breath sounds at the right base may indicate a respiratory complication, such as pneumonia or pleural effusion.
10. Renal Failure: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of renal failure, particularly if not properly managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x72 hours. During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 29.1;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Concern is that patient is
   leukopenic at 1.4. Cosyntropic stimulation test 0.3->2.8.
   - D/c arterial line
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for sedation
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer. Stable overnight after given 1U pRBCs
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   - Given that hematocrit stable for 36 hours, will check only once daily
   now.
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - Cont oxybutinin
   - Cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   - Consider getting psychiatry or SW involved given that patient seems
   severely depressed.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old gentleman with metastatic prostate cancer, readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of blood loss and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells since admission. His hematocrit has stabilized, and his blood cultures have not grown any organisms. He is being treated for liver function test (LFT) elevation, leukopenia, and anemia/thrombocytopenia. He has a history of radiation cystitis, and his liver function tests are trending upward. He is also being treated for chronic pain, depression, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Despite the patient's lack of fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, sepsis remains a concern due to the positive blood culture results.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be ruled out.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which needs to be managed.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may be secondary to bone metastases, which needs to be monitored.
5. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to bone metastatic prostate cancer, which needs to be managed.
6. Radiation Cystitis: The patient's radiation cystitis may require ongoing management to prevent further complications.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers need to be managed to prevent further complications.
8. DVT/PE: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but he is not an anticoagulation candidate. Monitoring for DVT/PE is necessary.
9. Depression: The patient's depression needs to be managed, and consideration should be given to involving a psychiatrist or social worker.
10. Palliative Care: The patient's code status is full code, and palliative care services have been consulted to increase patient comfort."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x48 hours.  During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Cosyntropic stimulation test
   0.3->2.8.
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for lethargy/confusion
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.
   - F/u oncology recs
   # Leukopenia:  Longstanding, likely secondary to bone metastases.
   - Trend counts
   # Anemia/thromboyctopenia: Per onc, thought likely secondary to bony
   metastatic prostate cancer. Stable overnight after given 1U pRBCs
   - Recheck CBC this pm, transfuse for hct<25 and plt <10.
   - Check [**Hospital1 **]
   # Radiation cystitis: Improved after urologic procedure with formalin.
   - Cont oxybutinin
   - Cont urojet
   # Elevated liver function tests: Likely result of liver metastases.
   - Trend LFTs
   # OSA: Continue CPAP at night.
   # Chronic pain: Reports pain is currently adequately controlled.
   Continue methadone, IV morphine for breakthrough, gabapentin, and
   decadron.
   # H/O DVT/PE: Not anticoagulation candidate, has IVC filter which was
   placed [**2168**].
   # Depression: Continue celexa.
   - Consider getting psychiatry or SW involved given that patient seems
   severely depressed.
   # Pressure Ulcer: Stage II left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year old gentleman with metastatic prostate CA readmitted to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Patient with stable BP x72 hours. During last admission
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], patient was intermitently hypotensive attributed to blood
   loss. On initial transfer, BP was fluid responsive. Uncertain etiology
   at this point, but differential includes hypovolemia from blood loss,
   sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.  Hematocrit this AM at 24.9;
   transfused 2 units since readmission to ICU. Hypotension unlikely to be
   secondary to blood loss given slow trend in hct.  He has blood cultures
   from [**10-24**] positive for coag negative staph, but [**1-12**] likely
   representing contamination.  Has not been febrile, tachycardic, or
   tachypneic, so sepsis is unlikely. Cosyntropic stimulation test
   0.3->2.8.
   - Taper steroid dose
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Antibiotics discontinued on [**2170-10-27**]
   - Monitor MAP, UOP, mentation and bolus as necessary
   # Altered mental status: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   LFTs continue to rise. Also may be secondary to pain medications. Waxes
   and wanes with no set time course.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold pain meds for lethargy/confusion
   # Metastatic Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to
   all therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions
   concerning for mets.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension. The patient has a history of blood loss, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency, but the current hypotension is unlikely to be secondary to blood loss given the slow trend in hematocrit. The patient's blood cultures from October 24th were positive for coag-negative staph, but it is likely representing contamination. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), likely due to liver metastases. He has leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to bone metastases. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but his albumin level is low. 

The patient's medical history includes radiation cystitis, which has improved after a urologic procedure with formalin. He has chronic pain, which is currently adequately controlled with medications. The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with celexa. He also has a pressure ulcer on his left ischial area, which is being treated with duoderm and Allevyn foam dressing.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 98 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Lethargic but arousable
* Unable to assess orientation
* Sclerae icteric
* Dry mucous membranes
* Decreased breath sounds at right base
* Soft, distended, +bs abdomen
* 1+ pitting edema bilaterally
* Pneumatic compression boots in place

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: Although the patient does not have fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea, sepsis cannot be completely ruled out.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and he has a history of liver metastases, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.
* Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may increase his risk of infection.
* Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding.
* Radiation cystitis: The patient has a history of radiation cystitis, which may cause urinary retention or other complications.
* Pressure ulcer: The patient's pressure ulcer may become infected or worsen if not properly treated.
* Depression: The patient's depression may worsen his overall prognosis and quality of life.
* Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may be managed with medications, but it may also affect his mental status and overall well-being.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Tapering of steroid dose
* Follow-up cultures
* Discontinuation of antibiotics
* Monitoring of MAP, UOP, mentation, and bolus as necessary
* Continuing lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
* Holding pain medications for lethargy/confusion
* Trending of LFTs
* Rechecking of CBC and transfusing as necessary
* Continuing celexa for depression
* Continuing treatment for pressure ulcer
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Continuing code status as full code"
