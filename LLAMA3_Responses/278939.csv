You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia admitted to the ICU with dehydration and a new HCT drop. She has a recent history of LLL PNA, treated with antibiotics, and now has a broadened antibiotic regimen to add vancomycin and zosyn. The patient has lab abnormalities, including a drop in all cell lines, elevated lactate, and increased INR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/51 mmHg. She has a sinus rhythm and is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals an anxious and overweight/obese individual with a loud systolic murmur, crackles in the left base of the chest, and a stage II pressure ulcer on the right heel and sacrum. She is not oriented and has a purposeful movement.

Lab results show elevated lactate levels, anemia, and decreased platelet count. Other lab results include elevated creatinine, glucose, and potassium levels.

The patient has a diagnosis of lactic acidosis, which is attributed to infection, metformin, renal dysfunction, and dehydration. The patient is also suspected to have sepsis, and empiric coverage for CDiff has been added.

The patient has a history of large hemorrhoids and has experienced a GI bleed, with melena and a slowly dropping HCT over the past couple of weeks. She has a cardiac murmur and is awaiting an outside echo. The patient has a DNR/DNI status and requires a meeting with her family regarding goals of care, CVC, and transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying infections and compromised immune system.
2. GI bleeding and hemorrhage due to the patient's history of large hemorrhoids and anemia.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's cardiac murmur.
4. Renal dysfunction and acute kidney injury due to the patient's dehydration and elevated creatinine levels.
5. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying respiratory disease and potential development of pneumonia.
6. Pressure ulcer complications, such as infection or deep tissue damage, due to the patient's stage II pressure ulcer.
7. Infection and sepsis due to the patient's central venous catheter (CVC) and potential for bloodstream infections.
8. Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, due to the patient's glucose levels and potential for insulin resistance.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, admitted to the ICU with dehydration, new HCT drop, and recent LLL PNA. She has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, which was stopped due to a negative MRSA swab. The patient has a history of dementia, making it difficult to obtain a detailed medical history. She has a cardiac murmur, and an outside echo result is pending.

The patient's current vital signs are: Tmax 37.7°C, Tcurrent 36.7°C, HR 96 bpm, BP 121/51 mmHg, RR 28 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 92%. She has a lactate level of 3.9, and her INR is 1.7.

The patient's physical examination reveals an anxious and overweight/obese individual with a soft, non-tender abdomen, and a pressure ulcer on the right heel and sacral area. Her neurologic examination shows that she is not oriented, does not follow simple commands, and responds to noxious stimuli.

Lab results show:

* HCT 23.0%
* WBC 3.8 and 3.9
* Plt 100 and 116
* Cr 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose 169 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 18.2/30.5/1.7, Alk Phos/ T Bili/0.3, Fibrinogen 434 mg/dL, Albumin 2.0 g/dL, LDH 218 IU/L, Ca++ 6.9 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.4 mg/dL, PO4 1.8 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's lactate level of 3.9, she is at risk of developing sepsis.
2. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level and INR suggest that she may be at risk of developing lactic acidosis.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's HCT drop and melena suggest that she may be at risk of a GI bleed.
4. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's pressure ulcer on the right heel and sacral area requires close monitoring and management.
5. Dementia-related Complications: The patient's advanced dementia increases her risk of developing complications such as aspiration, pneumonia, and skin breakdown.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac murmur and abnormal INR suggest that she may be at risk of developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's Cr level of 0.5 mg/dL suggests that she may be at risk of developing renal dysfunction.
8. Dehydration: The patient's dehydration and high lactate level suggest that she may be at risk of developing further dehydration.
9. Metabolic Complications: The patient's abnormal lab results, including high glucose and LDH levels, suggest that she may be at risk of developing metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hyperkalemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Sepsis: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative MRSA
   screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Also had lactic acidosis
   on admission, now resolved after fluid resuscitation.   Blood pressure
   has remained stable throughout her illness.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.  Now C. Diff negative x2, labs all stable, DIC labs negative.
   Clinically looks well, and is back to baseline per family.
   - No need for broad antibiotic coverage at this point. Will discontinue
   and follow clinically
   - Follow all cultures, no cough so unable to get sputum. All NGTD.
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Follow for 3^rd C. Diff to rule out, continue empiric therapy with IV
   flagyl until rules out
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - IVF prn as low PO
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lights on in am, lights out in pm to avoid sundowning
   - Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring
   - Correct any underlying infection or electrolyte disturbance
   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: After
   patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she developed decreasing
   Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of agressive volume
   resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable at 23 after significant
   volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS in the ED).  Increased on am
   labs today.  Guaiac negative in the ED, positive here. Unclear what her
   baseline hct is.
   - Continue to trend
   - IVF for volume prn
   - Consider GI consult if patient develops significant bleed
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: By report, has been poorly controlled.
   Patient was on metformin prior, now has a lactic acidosis, likely in
   the setting of continuing metformin with poor PO and diarrhea.  Also on
   lisinopril at home, low dose (? for renal protection vs. hypertension)
   - Hold oral agents metformin and glipizide
   - D/c metformin indefinitely
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   - Hold lisinopril pending improvement in blood pressures
   # Wound care: Patient has stage II decubitus ulcer and pressure ulcers
   on her heel.
   - Wound care consult
   # FEN: IVF prn as above, replete lytes prn
   # PPX: [**Last Name (LF) 701**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start diet today with nursing observation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Sepsis: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative MRSA
   screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Also had lactic acidosis
   on admission, now resolved after fluid resuscitation.   Blood pressure
   has remained stable throughout her illness.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.  Now C. Diff negative x2, labs all stable, DIC labs negative.
   Clinically looks well, and is back to baseline per family.
   - No need for broad antibiotic coverage at this point. Will discontinue
   and follow clinically
   - Follow all cultures, no cough so unable to get sputum. All NGTD.
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Follow for 3^rd C. Diff to rule out, continue empiric therapy with IV
   flagyl until rules out
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   - IVF prn as low PO
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lights on in am, lights out in pm to avoid sundowning
   - Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring
   - Correct any underlying infection or electrolyte disturbance
   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: After
   patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she developed decreasing
   Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of agressive volume
   resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable at 23 after significant
   volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS in the ED).  Increased on am
   labs today.  Guaiac negative in the ED, positive here. Unclear what her
   baseline hct is.
   - Continue to trend
   - IVF for volume prn
   - Consider GI consult if patient develops significant bleed
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: By report, has been poorly controlled.
   Patient was on metformin prior, now has a lactic acidosis, likely in

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, is currently in the ICU due to dehydration, somnolence, and significant diarrhea. She has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and was started on antibiotics for treatment. Her condition has improved, with her lactate levels trending down and her hemodynamics stable. She has also been experiencing acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed, and her Hct has decreased from 32 to 26.5. She has been started on IV fluids and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection may worsen, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. C. Diff colitis: Although the patient's C. Diff test was negative, she is still at risk for developing C. Diff colitis, which could worsen her diarrhea and increase her risk of complications.
3. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed may worsen, leading to further blood loss and anemia.
4. Wound infection: The patient's stage II decubitus ulcer and pressure ulcers on her heel may become infected, leading to further complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she may require intubation if her condition worsens.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and she may require correction of any imbalances to prevent complications.
8. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen, leading to increased difficulty with self-care and increased risk of falls.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to manage her GI bleed and anemia with IV fluids and blood transfusions as needed.
3. Monitor her wound care and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent infection and promote healing.
4. Continue to monitor her respiratory status and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Monitor her cardiac status and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
6. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
7. Continue to monitor her dementia and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent worsening of her condition.
8. Consider consulting with a geriatrics specialist to optimize the patient's care and improve her outcomes."

   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Lactic acidosis: Main concern for systemic hypoperfusion (shock) or
   regional hypoperfusion (ischemic bowel) as these would be most
   dangerous.  However her sbp was never below 115 and her heart rate has
   gradually decreased from a max of 103 with IVF.  Minimal temperature
   derangement and relatively normal WBC without bandemia on admission.
   Am labs, however, with decrease in all lines on CBC.  Also minimal
   abdominal pain, although difficult to adequately assess her symptoms
   given her underlying dementia.   Likely multifactorial with combination
   of dehydration and metformin induced as well as concern for sepsis
   given decreased WBC and platelets.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Blood, urine, stool (including c diff x3), sputum cultures if
   possible.  All blood cultures and urine culture were negative at
   outside facility.
   - No peritoneal signs
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Empiric c dif therapy for now with IV flagyl.  If patient tests
   positive, will likely change to PO Vanco based on ICU stay, age and
   comorbidities.
   # Septic shock: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative
   MRSA screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.
   - Continue to cover broadly with Vanc/Zosyn
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Low threshold to cover atypicals if patient decompensates
   - DIC labs negative
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Lactic acidosis: Main concern for systemic hypoperfusion (shock) or
   regional hypoperfusion (ischemic bowel) as these would be most
   dangerous.  However her sbp was never below 115 and her heart rate has
   gradually decreased from a max of 103 with IVF.  Minimal temperature
   derangement and relatively normal WBC without bandemia on admission.
   Am labs, however, with decrease in all lines on CBC.  Also minimal
   abdominal pain, although difficult to adequately assess her symptoms
   given her underlying dementia.   Likely multifactorial with combination
   of dehydration and metformin induced as well as concern for sepsis
   given decreased WBC and platelets.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Blood, urine, stool (including c diff x3), sputum cultures if
   possible.  All blood cultures and urine culture were negative at
   outside facility.
   - No peritoneal signs
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Empiric c dif therapy for now with IV flagyl.  If patient tests
   positive, will likely change to PO Vanco based on ICU stay, age and
   comorbidities.
   # Septic shock: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative
   MRSA screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.
   - Continue to cover broadly with Vanc/Zosyn
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Low threshold to cover atypicals if patient decompensates
   - DIC labs negative
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lights on in am, lights out in pm to avoid sundowning
   - Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring
   - Correct any underlying infection or electrolyte disturbance
   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: After
   patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she developed decreasing
   Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of agressive volume
   resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable at 23 after significant
   volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS in the ED).  Guaiac negative in
   the ED, positive here. Unclear what her baseline hct is.

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and abdominal pain. She has a history of pneumonia and was started on antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient's condition has been stabilized, with lactate trending down and hemodynamics stable. However, she continues to have a high risk of complications, including septic shock, DIC, and hemolysis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's continued treatment for pneumonia and her underlying comorbidities make her susceptible to septic shock.
2. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are trending down, but she may still be at risk for further lactic acidosis due to her underlying condition and treatment.
3. DIC: The patient's laboratory results show no evidence of DIC, but she is at risk for developing it due to her underlying condition and treatment.
4. Hemolysis: The patient's laboratory results show no evidence of hemolysis, but she is at risk for developing it due to her underlying condition and treatment.
5. Wound complications: The patient has stage II decubitus ulcers and pressure ulcers on her heel, which may become infected and lead to further complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may still be at risk for developing respiratory complications due to her underlying condition and treatment.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, but she may still be at risk for developing cardiovascular complications due to her underlying condition and treatment.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but she may still be at risk for developing neurological complications due to her underlying condition and treatment.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and monitor her response to treatment.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's wound status and provide wound care as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide respiratory support as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and provide cardiovascular support as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide neurological support as necessary.
7. Consider consulting a wound care specialist to provide further guidance on wound care.
8. Consider consulting a gastrointestinal specialist to provide further guidance on the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting with
   altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain while
   continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.
   # Lactic acidosis: Main concern for systemic hypoperfusion (shock) or
   regional hypoperfusion (ischemic bowel) as these would be most
   dangerous.  However her sbp was never below 115 and her heart rate has
   gradually decreased from a max of 103 with IVF.  Minimal temperature
   derangement and relatively normal WBC without bandemia on admission.
   Am labs, however, with decrease in all lines on CBC.  Also minimal
   abdominal pain, although difficult to adequately assess her symptoms
   given her underlying dementia.   Likely multifactorial with combination
   of dehydration and metformin induced as well as concern for sepsis
   given decreased WBC and platelets.
   - DIC and hemolysis labs negative
   - Blood, urine, stool (including c diff x3), sputum cultures if
   possible.  All blood cultures and urine culture were negative at
   outside facility.
   - No peritoneal signs
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Empiric c dif therapy for now with IV flagyl.  If patient tests
   positive, will likely change to PO Vanco based on ICU stay, age and
   comorbidities.
   # Septic shock: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative
   MRSA screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab, and
   received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk factors for
   multi-drug resistent organisms including uncontrolled diabetes, nursing
   home habitation, and severe pressure ulcers.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn for
   broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure ulcers).
   Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff in the setting of
   abx use.
   - Continue to cover broadly with Vanc/Zosyn
   - DFA for flu negative
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Low threshold to cover atypicals if patient decompensates
   - DIC labs negative
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
   # Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.  Has
   had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard to ability
   to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium during her initial
   admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement after treatment for
   underlying pna and dehydration.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Lights on in am, lights out in pm to avoid sundowning
   - Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring
   - Correct any underlying infection or electrolyte disturbance
   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed: After
   patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she developed decreasing
   Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of agressive volume
   resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable at 23 after significant
   volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS in the ED).  Guaiac negative in
   the ED, positive here. Unclear what her baseline hct is.
   - Continue to trend
   - Guaiac all stools, heme positive loose stool though patient has large
   hemorrhoids
   - IVF for volume prn
   - Consider GI consult if patient develops significant bleed
   - Maintain 2 large bore IVs
   # Diabetes mellitus type 2: By report, has been poorly controlled.
   Patient was on metformin prior, now has a lactic acidosis, likely in
   the setting of continuing metformin with poor PO and diarrhea.  Also on
   lisinopril at home, low dose (? for renal protection vs. hypertension)
   - Hold oral agents metformin and glipizide
   - D/c metformin indefinitely
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   - Hold lisinopril pending improvement in blood pressures and treatment
   of infection
   # Wound care: Patient has stage II decubitus ulcer and pressure ulcers
   on her heel.
   - Wound care consult in am
   # FEN: IVF prn as above, replete lytes prn
   # PPX: Pneumoboots, NPO for now. Will need to confirm PO consistency
   prior to restarting POs. Omeprazole as per outpatient regimen
   # Code: DNR/I confirmed with patient's daughter/HCP (hcp [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2200**]

   Disposition: Consider call-out to medicine floor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who presents with altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and abdominal pain while continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Lactic acidosis: 2.8 mmol/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 23%
* White blood cell count (WBC): 3.8-3.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 100-116 K/uL
* Blood cultures: Negative
* Urine culture: Negative
* Stool culture: Negative
* C. difficile (C. diff) test: Negative
* Legionella test: Negative
* Influenza test: Negative

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

1. Lactic acidosis: The main concern is systemic hypoperfusion (shock) or regional hypoperfusion (ischemic bowel) due to the patient's altered mental status, lactic acidosis, and abdominal pain.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and her laboratory results show decreased WBC and platelet counts, suggesting sepsis.
3. Acute on chronic blood loss anemia: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and her Hct has decreased from 32% to 26.5%.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has been poorly controlled and has developed lactic acidosis, likely due to continued metformin use with poor oral intake and diarrhea.
5. Wound care: The patient has stage II decubitus ulcers and pressure ulcers on her heel.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Empiric C. diff therapy with IV flagyl
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for sepsis
3. Insulin sliding scale for diabetes management
4. Hold oral agents metformin and glipizide
5. D/c metformin indefinitely
6. Continue IVF prn for volume resuscitation
7. Monitor respiratory status
8. Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring for altered mental status
9. Correct any underlying infection or electrolyte disturbance
10. Consider GI consult if patient develops significant bleeding

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is considered for transfer to the medicine floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS: infection, metformin, renal dysfunction, dehydration.
   No documented hypotension.
   Resolved with IV fluids.
   SEPSIS
   Empiric coverage: PO vanco for CDiff but now CDiff neg x 2. Continue
   until r/o. If neg, then attribute to viral gastroenteritis.
   LLL PNA recent diagnosis and s/p 7d ctx. No cough or secretions now.
   Will stop nosocomial pna coverage with vanc/zosyn.
   DEMENTIA
   At baseline
   GI BLEED
   Hct drop and melena. Hct has been slowly dropping over past couple of
   weeks.
   H/O large hemorrhoids.
   2 IVs, but access is an issue, particularly for blood draws.
   Check hct and decide PRBC transfusion.
   Start PO diet- have RN try thick liquid.
   Pantoprazole

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a chief complaint of dehydration and lactic acidosis. The patient has been empirically treated for CDiff sepsis and has shown improvement in their mental status to baseline.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 116/100 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, and they are not on any respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese individual with normal cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient's extremities are warm, with cyanosis noted in both feet. The patient's skin is warm and without rash or jaundice.

Laboratory results show the patient has a white blood cell count of 3.8-3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 100-116 K/uL. The patient's lactate level is 2.8 mmol/L, and their albumin level is 2.0 g/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with lactic acidosis, sepsis, dementia, and GI bleed. The patient's lactic acidosis has resolved with IV fluids, and their sepsis has been empirically covered with vancomycin for CDiff. However, the patient's CDiff test has been negative twice, and it is likely that the sepsis is due to viral gastroenteritis.

The patient's dementia is at baseline, and they are currently being treated with lorazepam for anxiety. The patient's GI bleed has caused a drop in their hemoglobin level, and they are at risk for further bleeding. The patient has been started on a PO diet, and their IV fluids have been adjusted to help manage their dehydration.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Further GI bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level has been dropping over the past couple of weeks, and they are at risk for further bleeding.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's CDiff test has been negative, they are still at risk for sepsis due to their underlying medical conditions.
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is still elevated, and they are at risk for further lactic acidosis if their underlying medical conditions are not managed properly.
4. Dehydration: The patient is still at risk for dehydration due to their underlying medical conditions and IV fluid management.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are at risk for respiratory failure if their underlying medical conditions are not managed properly.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and they are at risk for cardiac complications if their underlying medical conditions are not managed properly."
