You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, and alcohol poisoning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's neurological status is altered, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic function.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters, including:

* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 28 K/uL)
* Elevated creatinine (2.1 mg/dL)
* Elevated troponin-T (0.10 ng/mL)
* Elevated lactate acid (3.2 mmol/L)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT 50 IU/L, AST 135 IU/L)
* Abnormal kidney function tests (Cr 2.1 mg/dL, TCO2 13 mmol/L)
* Abnormal electrolyte levels (Ca++ 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 3.5 mg/dL)

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of sepsis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and elevated troponin-T levels may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of further bleeding or perforation.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemia may increase the risk of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding or hemorrhage.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate the presence of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests may indicate the presence of hepatic dysfunction or injury.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall individual with altered mental status, likely related to alcohol poisoning and starvation. They have received thiamine and D50 for hypoglycemia. The patient has received 1U of PRBC and has undergone fluid resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for icteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, and subtle inspiratory crackles at the bases of the lungs. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1-7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 24.2-22.8 g/dL, platelet count of 28-24, and creatinine of 2.1-1.9 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T is elevated at 0.10 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency, which can lead to altered mental status, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.
2. Hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
3. Myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulopathy.
5. Sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, multi-organ failure, and death.
6. DVT and PE, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
7. VAP, which can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, and death.

The patient's ICU care plan should focus on managing these potential complications, including maintaining glycemic control, preventing DVT and VAP, and providing adequate nutrition and hydration."

   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids.  No frank melena on exam to suggest brisk
   upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on presentation in setting of GI
   bleed.
   - NPO for now, apprec GI recs
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**3-8**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and current ETOH level of
   145.  Will place on CIWA scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV
   Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV to prevent Wernickes
   - dextrose [**1-27**] amp after thiamine
   -  D5 1/2NS IVF
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of bloody stools and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55, and ETOH level 145. She was diagnosed with anion gap acidosis, likely due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis, and lactate elevation.

The patient received thiamine 100mg IV, followed by dextrose and D5 1/2NS IVF to treat her hypoglycemia. She also received a banana bag with MVI, folate, and thiamine. The patient's lactate level is improving after hydration.

The patient has a history of poor nutrition status and long history of ETOH abuse, and she denies h/o withdrawal and current ETOH level of 145. She was placed on CIWA scale and received 4mg IV Ativan.

The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and a previous NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. She currently denies chest pain, and her EKGs are unchanged from prior.

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia likely due to ETOH abuse, and her platelet count is essentially at baseline. However, given her GI bleed, her platelet count may drop, and she may require platelet transfusion.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated anion gap and low blood sugar suggest that she may be at risk for this condition. Close monitoring of her lactate and ABG levels is necessary.
2. GI bleed: The patient's history of gastritis and duodenitis, as well as her elevated INR, suggest that she may be at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin and platelet count is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of thrombocytopenia and her current GI bleed put her at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of her platelet count and transfusion if necessary.
4. ETOH withdrawal: The patient's history of ETOH abuse and her current ETOH level of 145 suggest that she may be at risk for ETOH withdrawal. Close monitoring of her CIWA scale and administration of Ativan as necessary.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and cocaine abuse put her at risk for further cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring of her cardiac enzymes and EKGs is necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her anion gap acidosis, GI bleed, thrombocytopenia, ETOH withdrawal, and cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS

   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on
   presentation in setting of GI bleed.  HCT mostly stable, unlikely to be
   significant bleed.
   - GI with no plan to scope

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, who presented with 1 day of bloody rice bran paste (BRBPR) and elevated anion gap, glucose 55, and ETOH level 145. She has been diagnosed with anion gap acidosis, likely due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis, and lactate is improving after hydration. She has also been diagnosed with gastritis and duodenitis, and is at risk for upper GI bleed. She has a history of ETOH abuse and is currently denying withdrawal symptoms, but has been placed on the CIWA scale for monitoring. She has also been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and is at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of anion gap acidosis: If the patient's lactate levels do not continue to improve, she may be at risk for worsening anion gap acidosis, which could lead to further acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Upper GI bleed: Given the patient's diagnosis of gastritis and duodenitis, she is at risk for upper GI bleed, which could lead to hemorrhage, shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications, including GI bleed, if not properly managed.
4. ETOH withdrawal: Despite the patient's denial of withdrawal symptoms, she is at risk for ETOH withdrawal, which could lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other serious complications if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cirrhosis and malnutrition makes her at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and potential organ failure.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition could lead to further complications, including impaired wound healing, decreased immune function, and increased risk of infection.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's anion gap acidosis and ETOH abuse could lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.

   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count. Transfuse for <20k

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with Hepatitis C and EtOH cirrhosis, currently in the ICU due to a gastrointestinal bleed. She has a history of EtOH abuse and cocaine use. She was previously diagnosed with gastritis and duodenitis, and the current bleed is suspected to be related to gastritis or hemorrhoids. The patient's hemoglobin level has been stable, and she has received blood transfusions. She is experiencing mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawal, and her INR has improved with Vitamin K administration. She has also been diagnosed with anion gap acidosis, which is believed to be caused by lactate, EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to EtOH abuse, and she has received platelet transfusions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's current bleed is still active, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
2. EtOH/cocaine withdrawal: The patient is experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms, and there is a risk of severe withdrawal if not managed properly.
3. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis is still present, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of further bleeding if not managed properly.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar level is low, and there is a risk of further hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to her compromised immune system and the presence of a central line.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is currently experiencing tachycardia, which may be a sign of cardiac complications.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory complications due to her underlying liver disease and the presence of a central line.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleed and manage it accordingly.
2. Manage the patient's EtOH/cocaine withdrawal symptoms with medication and close monitoring.
3. Continue to manage the patient's anion gap acidosis with medication and close monitoring.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse platelets as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugar level and manage it accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and take prompt action if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and manage any cardiac complications that arise.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and manage any respiratory complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count. Transfuse for <20k
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: resolved, Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   # FEN: Regular diet
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, maybe one 20g, will readmit to unit if BRBPR for
   central line placement

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with Hepatitis C and ETOH cirrhosis, who has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to gastritis or possible hemorrhoids. The patient has been transfused with PRBC and platelets, and her hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable.

The patient is experiencing mild ETOH/cocaine withdrawal, which is being managed with CIWA scale and Ativan. The patient has a history of substance abuse and has tested positive for cocaine. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and she is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to ETOH abuse. However, given the GI bleed, the patient is at risk for further bleeding, and platelet transfusion may be necessary if the platelet count drops below 20,000.

The patient's anion gap acidosis has resolved, and it appears to have been caused by lactate, ETOH, and ketonemia from starvation. The patient has been given thiamine and dextrose to help resolve the acidosis.

The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored, and she is receiving aggressive electrolyte repletion. The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and she is receiving insulin as needed.

The patient's current medications include IV Protonix, IV hydralazine, and IV diazepam. She is also receiving a banana bag with MVI, folate, and thiamine IV for two more days.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 128/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's physical examination is notable for icteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, and subtle inspiratory crackles at the bases of the lungs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding
* Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding
* ETOH/cocaine withdrawal leading to seizures or other complications
* Anion gap acidosis leading to further electrolyte imbalances
* Hypoglycemia leading to seizures or coma
* Cardiac complications due to cocaine abuse
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 63-inch-tall individual, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, and a history of myocardial infarction, poisoning due to alcohol intoxication, and cocaine use. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.4°C, Tcurrent of 36.3°C, HR of 70 bpm, BP of 128/72 mmHg, RR of 13 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 28,000/μL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.1 K/μL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.10 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 3.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 286 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is stable, with a total input of 3,045 mL and a total output of 1,881 mL. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device used.

The patient's physical examination is incomplete, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

The patient's medical history is significant for angioedema due to lisinopril, and the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and poisoning due to alcohol and cocaine use.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding with continued bleeding or perforation
* Hypoglycemia with potential for further episodes
* Myocardial infarction with potential for further damage or complications
* Poisoning due to continued use of cocaine and alcohol, with potential for further withdrawal symptoms
* Altered mental status with potential for further decline or complications
* Infection due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other underlying conditions
* Fluid overload due to continued fluid administration
* Respiratory complications due to continued use of IV fluids and potential for pneumonia

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance, as well as to address the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on
   presentation in setting of GI bleed.  HCT mostly stable, unlikely to be
   significant bleed.
   - GI with no plan to scope
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**3-8**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use within
   past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on CIWA
   scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - will need SW c/s to re-address this issue

   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry

   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV to prevent Wernickes
   - dextrose [**1-27**] amp after thiamine
   -  D5 1/2NS IVF until eating
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count
   - transfuse 1u plts prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and Ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, who presented with 1 day of bloody stools (BRBPR) and elevated anion gap acidosis. The patient has a history of poor nutrition status, ETOH abuse, and cirrhosis, which may contribute to her current condition.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating possible metabolic acidosis. Her ETOH level is 145, which may indicate ongoing ETOH abuse. The patient has a history of NSTEMI in the setting of cocaine abuse, and her current ETOH level may be contributing to her current condition.

The patient's physical examination shows signs of dehydration, including dry mucous membranes and decreased urine output. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's treatment plan includes hydration with D5 1/2NS, IV thiamine to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy, and IV protonix to reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also receiving IV antibiotics and has been typed and crossed for 2u PRBCs.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and her current ETOH level may increase the risk of further bleeding.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate a metabolic acidosis, which may require further treatment.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of poor nutrition status and ETOH abuse may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cocaine withdrawal: The patient's history of cocaine abuse and current ETOH level may increase the risk of cocaine withdrawal symptoms, including hypertension, anxiety, and tachycardia.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and current ETOH level may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.

In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and ETOH cirrhosis, who presented with bloody stools and elevated anion gap acidosis. Her treatment plan includes hydration, IV thiamine, and IV protonix, and she is at risk for bleeding complications, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, cocaine withdrawal, infection, and cardiovascular complications."
