   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output
   and some worsening of renal failure..
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): delta delta initially favoring slight
   mixed gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
   related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output .
   Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to
   CKD and possibly RTA.
   -          Continue to evaluate for infectious etiology for diarrhea,
   check c. diff and stool cx
   -          With improvement in ABG, will d/c bicarb fluids.
   -          Continue to follow anion gap and lytes.
   -          Check urine lytes for urinary gap.
   -          Management of ARF below.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
   Worsened 3.0
 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according
   to the patient and husband.  Now with mild improvement.
   -          Renal to see today; will discuss initiation of HD timing
   -          Needs HD access; likely tunneled line; has seen transplant
   as outpatient for access options.
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC
   -          Continue IV flagyl for now
   -          Check stool culture and c.diff.
   DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need for
   significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Lungs
   clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.
   -          Treatment of acidosis as above
   -          Monitor oxygenation with getting fluids overnight.
   -          Patient at risk for tiring
 hypoventilation; will watch in
   unit today.
   CONFUSION/altered MENTAL STATUS. Seems to be approaching baseline
   today.
   -          likely metabolic component or medication;  holding ditropan,
   tigan
   CELLULITIS, unclear if this is a new finding of infection or related to
   venous stasis.  Being managed by derm as outpatient for venous stasis.
   Appears that upper thigh erythema may be ?new.
   -          Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, consider continuing
   q48h. consider vanco level in AM if continuing.
   -          Continue topical antifungal powder
   -          Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections.
   MACROCYTOSIS.  Ongoing x years.  Unclear source but does have history
   of B12 deficiency, getting monthly IM replacement.
   -          recheck folate and B12; thyroid studies, as has history of
   significantly abnormal TSH levels in the past (most recently WNL).
   -          Will check into prior workup for this.
   HYPERTENSION. Normotensive currently
   -          Holding CCBs with peripheral edema; will monitor today and
   possible restart.
   CAD
   -          Continue aspirin daily
   GERD
   -          continue protonix 40mg IV BID (on at home); can change to PO
   when ostomy output improves.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap academia in the setting of increased ostomy output and worsening of renal failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Acidosis, metabolic (gap): likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease stage V: worsened from 3.0 to 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output.
3. Increased ostomy output: consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics and elevated WBC.
4. Dyspnea: mostly exertional, likely related to acidemia and need for significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.
5. Confusion/altered mental status: likely metabolic component or medication; holding ditropan and tigan.
6. Cellulitis: unclear if this is a new finding of infection or related to venous stasis.
7. Macrocytosis: ongoing for years, unclear source, but has history of B12 deficiency and receives monthly IM replacement.
8. Hypertension: normotensive currently, holding CCBs with peripheral edema.
9. CAD: continue aspirin daily.
10. GERD: continue protonix 40mg IV BID (on at home); can change to PO when ostomy output improves.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening of acidosis, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
2. Progression of acute on chronic renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to c.diff enteritis or other infections.
4. Respiratory failure due to worsening acidemia and hypoxemia.
5. Cardiovascular instability due to hypertension, acidosis, and potential electrolyte imbalances.
6. Neurological deterioration due to metabolic encephalopathy or medication-related effects.
7. Delayed wound healing and potential complications due to cellulitis and ostomy output.
8. Ongoing macrocytosis and potential bone marrow suppression due to B12 deficiency.
9. Potential complications from long-term use of medications such as protonix and aspirin.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust management accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall individual who is critically ill and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to dyspnea. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and the note highlights the presence of metabolic acidosis.

Physiological parameters:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 17.3 K/uL (normal range: 4-11 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 252 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 3.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 45 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Electrolyte levels:
	+ Sodium: 137 mmol/L (normal range: 135-145 mmol/L)
	+ Potassium: 4.1 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.5 mmol/L)
	+ Chloride: 98 mmol/L (normal range: 95-107 mmol/L)
	+ Bicarbonate: 11 mmol/L (normal range: 22-29 mmol/L)

Potential medical complications:

1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is 11 mmol/L, which is low, indicating a metabolic acidosis. This condition can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
2. Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating chronic kidney disease. This condition can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 16 inspirations per minute, which is slightly elevated. This could be a sign of respiratory failure, which can lead to complications such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
4. Infections: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an infection. The pending blood cultures and C. difficile testing may provide further information on this.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's albumin level is 2.7 g/dL, which is low. This could indicate malnutrition or inadequate nutrition, which can lead to complications such as muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired wound healing.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their metabolic acidosis, chronic renal failure, and potential infections. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address these complications and improve the patient's overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output.
   She remains with a metabolic acidosis with normal delta delta gap and
   no osmolar gap, no osmolar gap. This is more consistent with acute
   renal failure/uremia and ketosis (lactate wnl) rather than diarrhea or
   renal failure which more commonly produce a non-gap acidosis, though
   there may be a component of worsening renal failure or RTA that is
   contributing to the metabolic acidosis. Her ARF on top of CKD-V likely
   from volume depletion given increased ostomy output while on
   furosemide. She additionally could have developed a cellulitis in an
   area of skin breakdown on her lower extremities.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): normal delta delta, no osmolar gap.
   Lactate normal.  Likely related to worsening of renal failure and
   increased ostomy output (though would expect nongap component).  Does
   have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to CKD.
   -          Continue to evaluate for infectious etiology for diarrhea,
   check c. diff and stool cx
   -          Continue bicarb infusion (3 amps) at 150cc hour
   -          Continue to follow anion gap
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
   Worsened 3.0
 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according
   to the patient and husband.  Now with mild improvement.
   -          Renal aware, notified in the ED, recommended continuing
   HCO3^- gtt tonight
   -          Needs HD access; consider tunneled line vs temp access
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC
   -          Received flagyl in the ED. If toxin positive, continue
   medication, consider PO vanco given ICU level of care
   -          Check stool culture
   CONFUSION/altered MENTAL STATUS

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 y/o female with advanced CKD and ostomy, admitted
   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output.
   She remains with a metabolic acidosis with normal delta delta gap and
   no osmolar gap, no osmolar gap. This is more consistent with acute
   renal failure/uremia and ketosis (lactate wnl) rather than diarrhea or
   renal failure which more commonly produce a non-gap acidosis, though
   there may be a component of worsening renal failure or RTA that is
   contributing to the metabolic acidosis. Her ARF on top of CKD-V likely
   from volume depletion given increased ostomy output while on
   furosemide. She additionally could have developed a cellulitis in an
   area of skin breakdown on her lower extremities.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): normal delta delta, no osmolar gap.
   Lactate normal.  Likely related to worsening of renal failure and
   increased ostomy output (though would expect nongap component).  Does
   have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to CKD.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap acidosis in the setting of increased ostomy output. The patient remains with a metabolic acidosis with a normal delta-delta gap and no osmolar gap, suggesting acute renal failure/uremia and ketosis rather than diarrhea or renal failure.

The patient's acidosis is likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output, although a component of worsening renal failure or renal tubular acidosis (RTA) may also be contributing. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is worsened, with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output, although a component of worsening renal failure or RTA may also be contributing.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating worsening of renal function.
3. Increased ostomy output: The patient's ostomy output has increased, which may be contributing to the acidosis.
4. Confusion/altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be related to metabolic components or medications.
5. Cellulitis: The patient has a skin breakdown on her lower extremities, which may be related to cellulitis or venous stasis.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be contributing to her condition.
7. CAD: The patient has coronary artery disease, which may be contributing to her condition.
8. GERD: The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be contributing to her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of acidosis: The patient's acidosis may worsen if not adequately managed.
2. Further decline in renal function: The patient's renal function may decline further if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her compromised immune system and skin breakdown.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and CAD may lead to cardiovascular complications if not managed appropriately.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's acidosis and decreased renal function may lead to respiratory complications if not managed appropriately.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to manage the patient's acidosis with bicarbonate infusion and close monitoring of her acid-base status.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue to evaluate the patient for infectious etiologies of her diarrhea and consider c. difficile enteritis.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and CAD with medications and lifestyle modifications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider placement of a tunneled line for hemodialysis access.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and consider topical antifungal powder to prevent further infection."

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent colectomy and is currently experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of metabolic acidosis. She has a history of chronic deconditioning, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, macroglossia, and distended abdomen with a green output from the ostomy bag. Her laboratory results show acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing SOB and respiratory rate suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly given her underlying chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and increased ostomy output may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis.
3. Skin cellulitis: The patient's skin lesions on her thighs may be indicative of cellulitis, which could spread and lead to sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed with adequate treatment, including bicarbonate therapy.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, particularly if not well-controlled.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Initiate empiric antibiotics for possible infections, including c. difficile and other potential pathogens.
3. Consider starting bicarbonate therapy to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis.
4. Evaluate the patient's skin lesions on her thighs and consider obtaining a US of the thighs to rule out cellulitis.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider initiating hemodialysis if necessary.
6. Consider initiating BiPAP therapy if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
7. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors.
8. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of her chronic kidney disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), ulcerative colitis (UC) who underwent colectomy and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to increasing shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap (AG) and a non-gap component, suggesting a renal tubular acidosis (RTA) rather than a stool bicarbonate loss. The patient is also experiencing chronic deconditioning, leukocytosis, and potential skin cellulitis on the thighs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing SOB and metabolic acidosis may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and potential skin cellulitis may indicate an underlying sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and increasing creatinine levels may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to further renal dysfunction.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed with adequate bicarbonate therapy, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and potential skin cellulitis may increase the risk of infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and potential malnutrition may lead to further complications, such as decreased immune function and increased risk of infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), ulcerative colitis (UC) status post-colectomy, and increasing shortness of breath (SOB). She has acute on chronic renal failure with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to high stool output. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg. She has a history of chronic deconditioning, leukocytosis, and potential skin cellulitis on her thighs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increasing SOB and high anion gap metabolic acidosis suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and potential skin cellulitis on her thighs may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and high anion gap metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and further compromising her renal function.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ulcerative colitis and recent colectomy may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, abscess, or bleeding.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient should receive aggressive management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as empiric antibiotics for potential sepsis. Additionally, the patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to initiating hemodialysis if her condition worsens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and a history of colectomy. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB).

The patient's acid-base status is described as metabolic acidosis, with a high anion gap (AG) component, likely due to acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's respiratory efforts are attempting to compensate for the acidosis, but the pH remains below 7.35.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* WBC: 17.3-12.5 K/uL (leukocytosis)
* Hct: 28.1-26.4% (anemia)
* Plt: 252-217 K/uL (thrombocytopenia)
* Cr: 3.8-3.6 mg/dL (chronic kidney disease)
* TCO2: 9 mmol/L (metabolic acidosis)
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL (normal)
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.0/41.1/1.5 (elevated), ALT/AST: 9-16 IU/L (elevated), Alk Phos/T Bili: 152/0.2 IU/L (elevated), Amylase/Lipase: 67/37 IU/L (elevated), Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L (normal), Albumin: 2.7 g/dL (normal), LDH: 199 IU/L (elevated), Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL (normal), Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL (normal), PO4: 4.3 mg/dL (normal)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese
* Exopthalmotic appearance
* Macroglossia
* Soft, bowel sounds present, distended, non-tender abdomen
* Obese, ostomy bag with green output
* Erythema medial thighs, non-tender
* Trace pink/red plaques along medial aspect of lower calves

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Progressive respiratory acidosis, potentially leading to respiratory failure
* Increased risk of sepsis due to leukocytosis and ostomy output
* Development of skin cellulitis or abscesses on the thighs
* Progression of chronic kidney disease, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Potential for electrolyte imbalances due to chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis
* Increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and potential for electrolyte imbalances

Based on the patient's condition, the plan includes:

* Cont HCO3 for now till PH close to 7.35 and HCO close to 18
* Repeat ABG with concern for likely progression of resp acidosis given increase work of breathing
* f/u with renal re: regarding initiation of HD
* Flagyl (started IV) for empiric coverage pending results of c. dif
* US of the thighs to evaluate for skin cellulitis
* Hold treatment for HTN for now
* Continue ASA and plavix for CAD
* Consider BiPAP at night for OSA"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and a history of colectomy. She has been admitted to the ICU with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and metabolic acidosis. Her condition has improved over the last 24 hours, and she is now stable. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (64-110 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/63 mmHg (78-160/91 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (13-23 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemoglobin: 22.2% (normal range: 25-35%)
* White blood cell count: 17.3 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 175 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.39, pCO2 of 26 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 16 mmol/L
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 22.2% (normal range: 25-35%)
* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-1.5 mmol/L)

The patient's medications include:

* Ciprofloxacin (started IV on day 1) for probable urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Flagyl (started IV on day 1) for empiric treatment of UTI
* Vancomycin (started on day 1) for skin cellulitis on thigh
* Protonix (Pantoprazole) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Epoetin alfa (EPO) for anemia

The patient's plan includes:

* Restarting home PO HCO3 for metabolic acidosis
* Following up with renal re regarding initiation of hemodialysis (HD)
* Restarting EPO for anemia
* Checking hemolysis labs and retic count
* Continuing treatment for leukocytosis with increased ostomy output
* Monitoring for skin cellulitis on thigh and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Holding treatment for hypertension (HTN) for now
* Continuing ASA and Plavix for coronary artery disease (CAD)
* Continuing BiPAP at night for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to metabolic acidosis and anemia
* Infection due to increased ostomy output and leukocytosis
* Skin cellulitis or abscess on thigh
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypertension
* Anemia due to chronic kidney disease and decreased erythropoietin production
* Metabolic acidosis due to chronic kidney disease and increased lactate production."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent colectomy and is currently experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) due to metabolic acidosis. Her condition is complicated by acute on chronic renal failure, increased illeostomy output, and respiratory efforts to compensate for the acidosis. Her metabolic acidosis is characterized by a high anion gap (AG) with normal lactate and trace ketones in urine and serum.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Renal function: creatinine 3.8 mg/dL, urea nitrogen 175 K/uL, and potassium 4.1 mEq/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL, with a decrease from 9.1 g/dL on admission
* White blood cell count: 17.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: not available
* Electrolytes: sodium 111 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, and magnesium 1.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 40 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 251 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Restarting home PO HCO3
* Following up with renal re regarding initiation of hemodialysis (HD)
* Restarting EPO for anemia
* Checking hemolysis labs and retic count
* Continuing treatment for C. difficile infection
* Treating with Flagyl and Cipro for probable UTI
* Monitoring for skin cellulitis on thigh
* Holding treatment for hypertension
* Continuing ASA and Plavix for CAD
* Using BiPAP at night for OSA

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening metabolic acidosis
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to electrolyte imbalances
* Infection such as sepsis or UTI due to C. difficile or other bacterial pathogens
* Anemia due to chronic kidney disease or blood loss
* Skin cellulitis or abscess due to bacterial infection
* Hypertension due to electrolyte imbalances or chronic kidney disease
* OSA due to respiratory failure or chronic kidney disease
* Cardiovascular disease such as CAD or heart failure due to chronic kidney disease or hypertension"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), undergoing treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) after a colectomy. The patient is experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and metabolic acidosis, likely due to acute on chronic renal failure and increased ileostomy output.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute (bpm), and oxygen saturation is 98%. She is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and a distended abdomen with green output from the ostomy site. Her extremities are warm, and she has a 1+ edema in both legs.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.3 g/dL
* White blood cell (WBC) count of 17.3 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count of 175 x 10^9/L
* Serum creatinine (Cr) level of 3.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL
* Serum potassium (K+) level of 4.1 mEq/L
* Serum sodium (Na+) level of 140 mEq/L
* Serum chloride (Cl-) level of 110 mEq/L
* Serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 16 mEq/L
* Glucose level of 87 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Renal failure and metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to acute on chronic renal failure, and her respiratory efforts are compensating for the acidosis. She will be restarted on home PO HCO3 and followed up with renal re regarding initiation of hemodialysis (HD).
* Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped to 22% from 30% on admission, likely due to heme-occult stools. She will be restarted on erythropoietin (EPO) and will have hemolysis labs and reticulocyte count checked.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has an unclear source of leukocytosis, which may be related to her recent antibiotic course. She will continue to receive empiric treatment for now, and a dirty urine analysis (UA) will be performed to rule out a urinary tract infection (UTI).
* Skin cellulitis: The patient has improved skin cellulitis on her thigh, and a vancomycin (Vanco) course will be continued for 10 days.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of the patient's renal failure and metabolic acidosis, potentially leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
* Development of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Progression of the patient's anemia, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications.
* Skin cellulitis, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or myocardial infarction, due to the patient's pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent colectomy and is currently experiencing increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and respiratory distress. She has a history of chronic deconditioning, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's current condition is characterized by acute on chronic renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. She has also developed leukocytosis and is being empirically treated for possible Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. She has crackles in her bilateral lung bases and is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3, hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 175 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 40 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 251 IU/L, and her calcium level is 7.7 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Progressive respiratory acidosis: The patient's increasing work of breathing and metabolic acidosis may lead to progressive respiratory acidosis, which could worsen her respiratory distress.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's leukocytosis and empiric treatment for possible C. difficile infection may indicate a severe infection that requires prompt treatment.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Skin cellulitis: The patient's skin cellulitis may progress and require further treatment, including antibiotics and surgical intervention.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN may indicate hyperkalemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level may indicate hypocalcemia, which could lead to muscle weakness, cramping, and other symptoms.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and potential infections. She should also be evaluated for further complications such as renal failure, skin cellulitis, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis. She has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and her laboratory results show a low baseline bicarbonate level, likely related to CKD and possibly renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The patient's anion gap acidosis is likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output. She has been started on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and flagyl for a possible Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) enteritis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Renal Failure: The patient's CKD is likely to progress, leading to further decline in kidney function and potentially requiring hemodialysis.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and altered mental status.
3. UTI: The patient's UTI may not be fully treated, leading to worsening symptoms and potentially spreading to the bloodstream.
4. C. diff Enteritis: The patient's C. diff enteritis may not be fully treated, leading to worsening symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis may worsen, leading to skin necrosis, gangrene, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Macrocytosis: The patient's macrocytosis may be related to vitamin B12 deficiency, which may worsen if not adequately treated.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications.
9. GERD: The patient's GERD may worsen, leading to complications such as esophagitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. VAP: The patient's VAP may worsen, leading to respiratory complications and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue treatment for UTI and C. diff enteritis.

   with marked anion gap academia in setting of increased ostomy output
   and some worsening of renal failure..
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC (GAP): delta delta initially favoring slight
   mixed gap-nongap component, no osmolar gap.  Lactate normal.  Likely
   related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output .
   Does have a significantly low baseline (mid teens) likely related to
   CKD and possibly RTA.  Urine lytes and gap c/w RTA.
   -          Hold further bicarb IV for now, ?restart PO bicarb.  will
   d/w renal.
   -          Management of CKD below.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE STAGE V.
   Worsened 3.0
 3.9 without appreciable drop in urine output according
   to the patient and husband.  Now with improvement to 3.3.
   -          Awaiting renal's decision re: initiation of HD timing
   -          If HD this admit will need access; likely tunneled line; has
   seen transplant as outpatient for access options.
   INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT
   -          consider c.diff enteritis given recent antibiotics, elevated
   WBC which responded with flagyl initiation, though would be rare to
   have enteritis without colon.
   -          Continue IV flagyl for now
   -          Check stool culture and c.dif (2nd today)f.
   ANEMIA.  Dropping steadily since admit; hct 22 today (30 at admit).  No
   obvious bleeding source or hematoma.  Baseline B12 deficiency
   (repleted), MDS, CKD.
   -         check hemolysis panel today (?history of this in the past)
   -         T&S, would not transfuse unless <21
   -         Consider restart of epo - both MDS and significant CKD.
   -         Guaiac stools.
   DYSPNEA.  Mostly exertional; likely related to acidemia and need for
   significant respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Lungs
   clear on exam and imaging; oxygenating well.
   -          Treatment of acidosis as above
 CELLULITIS.  unclear if this is a new finding of infection or related
   to venous stasis.  Was being managed by derm as outpatient for venous
   stasis.
   -          Received 1000mg IV Vancomycin in the ED, consider continuing
   q48h. consider vanco level in AM if continuing.
   -          Continue topical antifungal powder
   -          Bilat LE ultrasounds to r/o collections - done, negative for
   collections.
   MACROCYTOSIS.  Ongoing x years.  Does have history of B12 deficiency,
   getting monthly IM replacement and normal B12 (and folate) levels
   here.  Also with history of ?MDS, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 377**] in the past.
   HYPERTENSION. Normotensive currently
   -          Holding CCBs with peripheral edema; will monitor today and
   possible restart.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ostomy, admitted with marked anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's acidosis is likely related to worsening of renal failure and increased ostomy output.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the patient is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are low, and the patient is at risk of developing complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and fatigue.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are dropping, and the patient is at risk of developing complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of cellulitis and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient is at risk of developing bleeding complications.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, and the patient is at risk of developing complications such as muscle cramps, tingling, and weakness.
7. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are low, and the patient is at risk of developing complications such as muscle weakness, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are high, and the patient is at risk of developing complications such as bone disease, soft tissue calcification, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease, ostomy, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which increases the risk of developing these complications. The patient's current medications, including antacids and proton pump inhibitors, may also contribute to the development of these complications."
