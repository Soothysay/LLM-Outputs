   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Bacteremia: Currently does not meet SIRS criteria. Pt admitted with
   +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur today that has not His last episode of
   fever was yesterday, though he still feels weak. BP since admission
   have also been noted to be slightly below pt's baseline (110-120s) in
   the low 100s pt had central line placed in ED. Pt
s ED cultures from
   yesterday afternoon turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC early this AM.
   Concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive so quickly, will
   await speciation and sensitivities. Will start on Vancomycin given his
   history of prolonged intubated and hospitalization for MRSA coverage.
   Will also started Ceftriaxone for Strep coverage. As pt received a dose
   of Zosyn in the ED will not add Pseudomonal coverage at this time. If
   pt does start to decompensate will consider starting Pseudomonal
   coverage.
   - f/u OSH bld cultures, f/u ED bld culture speciation
   - Echo to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary pt was due to
   have a repeat echo to check EF). Will discuss with Cards whether they
   would prefer a TTE or a TEE.
   # Hypotension: Pt noted to be hypotensive in the ED with SBP will
   continue small 500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported
   decrease in urine output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3.
   Last night pt
s SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating
   well. Given his low Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night
   however his BP responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the
   fact that he received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due
   concerns of inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s
   when pt is sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 90s during sleep
   - Will continue bolus NS, caution as pt has EF of 20-25%
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - Will hold BP regimen
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - Will hold BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Will obtain Echo today
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hypotension, will continue to
   follow q6hr Na and assess response to NS.
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - Will place pt on Heparin gtt in case he needs to undergo any
   procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: Pt's current Creatinine noted to be back to his lowest level of
   1.1, on review of [**Hospital **] rehab records show his lowest Creatinine to be
   1.25 from several days ago. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded
   to fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend Creatinine
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.
   # FEN: Will start on pt on cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes PRN
   # PPx: Already on Coumadin , PPI.
   # h.o. V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6 minute
   episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is scheduled to
   have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no plans for ICD
   whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac rehabilitation, V-fib arrest, and a pacemaker. He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for suspected bacteremia, with positive cultures from his blood and ED cultures. He is currently hypotensive, with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s, and has a decreased urine output. His creatinine is elevated at 1.1 mg/dL, and he has a history of anoxic injury.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a holosystolic murmur over the right upper sternal border, and his laboratory results show an elevated troponin level. He has a history of CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's positive blood cultures and ED cultures indicate a high risk of bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotensive state can lead to decreased organ perfusion, including the kidneys, liver, and brain, which can result in organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output indicate a high risk of acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia increase his risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of V-fib arrest and pacemaker implantation increase his risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic injury and cardiac arrest increase his risk of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment.
7. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and ED cultures indicate a high risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Bacteremia: Currently does not meet SIRS criteria. Pt admitted with
   +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur today that has not His last episode of
   fever was yesterday, though he still feels weak. BP since admission
   have also been noted to be slightly below pt's baseline (110-120s) in
   the low 100s pt had central line placed in ED. Pt
s ED cultures from
   yesterday afternoon turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC early this AM.
   Concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive so quickly, will
   await speciation and sensitivities. Will start on Vancomycin given his
   history of prolonged intubated and hospitalization for MRSA coverage.
   Will also started Ceftriaxone for Strep coverage. As pt received a dose
   of Zosyn in the ED will not add Pseudomonal coverage at this time. If
   pt does start to decompensate will consider starting Pseudomonal
   coverage.
   - f/u OSH bld cultures, f/u ED bld culture speciation
   - Echo to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary pt was due to
   have a repeat echo to check EF). Will discuss with Cards whether they
   would prefer a TTE or a TEE.
   # Hypotension: Pt noted to be hypotensive in the ED with SBP will
   continue small 500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported
   decrease in urine output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3.
   Last night pt
s SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating
   well. Given his low Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night
   however his BP responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the
   fact that he received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due
   concerns of inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s
   when pt is sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 90s during sleep
   - Will continue bolus NS, caution as pt has EF of 20-25%
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - Will hold BP regimen
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - Will hold BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Will obtain Echo today
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hypotension, will continue to
   follow q6hr Na and assess response to NS.
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - Will place pt on Heparin gtt in case he needs to undergo any
   procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: Pt's current Creatinine noted to be back to his lowest level of
   1.1, on review of [**Hospital **] rehab records show his lowest Creatinine to be
   1.25 from several days ago. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded
   to fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend Creatinine
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.
   # FEN: Will start on pt on cardiac/diabetic diet, replete lytes PRN
   # PPx: Already on Coumadin , PPI.
   # h.o. V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6 minute
   episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is scheduled to
   have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no plans for ICD
   whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   His blood culture have since returned positive [**3-21**] for GPC
s overnight.
   He remains fluid sensitive but no longer hypotensive and actually would
   like to advance diet today. He denies dyspnea. Rt IJ line placed in EW
   but he has not needed pressors thus far.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99. BP of 101/58 HR 78 RR of 12 with sats of 99%
   on RA . he is oriented to time and place and person and has excellent
   air entry in all lung fields. He does manifest a [**2-20**] PSM at left
   sternal border but there are no features of systemic embolization. He
   has hypoesthesia in ulnar distribution of right hand but strength is
   preserved. ? splinter hemorrhage in subungual region of right ring
   finger will need to be followed.
   Labs notable for WBC 6.9K, HCT of 25, K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.1 ( better) ,
   lactate of 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly but no infiltrate or effusions ,
   EKG is paced at 75.
   Agree with plan to workup for endocarditis on account of high grade
   bactermia and sepsis. He has not shown signs of persistent hemodynamic
   instability and is fluid sensitive. He will need TTE ( possibly TEE)
   and IV antibiotics today ( Vanco/ CFXN). We will follow for stigmata of
   peripheral embolization closely. RIJ line is likely contaminated too
   but would hold off on D/Cing this altogether till we are sure he does
   not need pressors over next 24 hours. If there is evidence for
   vegetation, will request cardiology and cardiothoracic staff to see
   over weekend.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

   He remains fluid sensitive but no longer hypotensive and actually would
   like to advance diet today. He denies dyspnea. Rt IJ line placed in EW
   but he has not needed pressors thus far.
   Exam notable for Tm of 99. BP of 101/58 HR 78 RR of 12 with sats of 99%
   on RA . he is oriented to time and place and person and has excellent
   air entry in all lung fields. He does manifest a [**2-20**] PSM at left
   sternal border but there are no features of systemic embolization. He
   has hypoesthesia in ulnar distribution of right hand but strength is
   preserved. ? splinter hemorrhage in subungual region of right ring
   finger will need to be followed.
   Labs notable for WBC 6.9K, HCT of 25, K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.1 ( better) ,
   lactate of 1.5. CXR with cardiomegaly but no infiltrate or effusions ,
   EKG is paced at 75.
   Agree with plan to workup for endocarditis on account of high grade
   bactermia and sepsis. He has not shown signs of persistent hemodynamic
   instability and is fluid sensitive. He will need TTE ( possibly TEE)
   and IV antibiotics today ( Vanco/ CFXN). We will follow for stigmata of
   peripheral embolization closely. RIJ line is likely contaminated too
   but would hold off on D/Cing this altogether till we are sure he does
   not need pressors over next 24 hours. If there is evidence for
   vegetation, will request cardiology and cardiothoracic staff to see
   over weekend.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old Caucasian male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of bacteremia. He has a history of prolonged intubation and hospitalization for MRSA coverage. The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a presep catheter, insertion of a 20-gauge line, and initiation of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 96%, and he is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing individual with a regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a holosystolic murmur over the right upper sternal border. His abdomen is soft, and his extremities have 2+ pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 23.1%
* Platelet count: 92 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18 mg/dL
* Glucose: 144 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 128 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture has turned positive for GPC, and he is being treated with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
* Hypotension: The patient is being monitored for hypotension, and small boluses of normal saline are being given as needed.
* sCHF: The patient has a history of A. fib and is being treated with Metoprolol and Spironolactone.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is being monitored, and he is being treated with normal saline.
* A. fib: The patient has a history of A. fib and is being treated with Coumadin and Amiodarone.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is being treated with ASA, Simvastatin, and Metoprolol.
* CRI: The patient's creatinine level is being trended, and he is being treated with fluid hydration.
* NIDDM: The patient has a history of NIDDM and is being treated with ISS, Glargine, and a cardiac/diabetic diet.
* FEN: The patient is being started on a cardiac/diabetic diet and is being repleted with electrolytes as needed.
* PPx: The patient is already on Coumadin and PPI.
* h.o. V. fib: The patient has a history of V. fib arrest and is scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and sepsis, endocarditis is a potential complication that needs to be worked up.
* Peripheral embolization: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis can lead to peripheral embolization, which needs to be closely monitored.
* Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output can lead to hypovolemic shock, which needs to be treated promptly.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of A. fib and CAD can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which need to be closely monitored and treated promptly.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for renal failure, which needs to be closely monitored and treated promptly.
* Infection: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis can lead to infection, which needs to be closely monitored and treated promptly.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
* Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Trend the patient's creatinine level and adjust fluid hydration accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's sodium level and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Work up for endocarditis and peripheral embolization.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and treat any arrhythmias promptly.
* Consider placement of an ICD and LV lead if indicated.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Consider placement of a dialysis catheter if the patient's creatinine level continues to rise."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. His current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T=35.2°C, HR=78 bpm, BP=116/57 mmHg, RR=15 inspirations per minute, SpO2=96%.
* Laboratory results: WBC=8.5 K/μL, Hct=23.1%, Plt=92, Cr=1.1 mg/dL, Glucose=144 mg/dL, Lactic acid=1.0 mmol/L.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 2,290 mL of fluids since admission, with a net balance of 1,090 mL.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's CVP is 13 mmHg, and his mixed venous O2 sat is 59%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, and his ABG is 22 mmHg.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Sepsis: The patient's BCx grew out enterococcus, which is sensitive to both ampicillin and vancomycin. He was started on 2 gm IV ampicillin q4h.
* Hypotension: The patient's SBP decreased to the 80s while sleeping, and he received a 250 cc NS bolus with an increase in his pressures to the 100s-110s.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 99, which is below his baseline of 200-300.
* sCHF: The patient has an EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for V fib arrest.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 131 mmol/L, which is likely due to hypovolemic hypotension.
* A. Fib: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and Amiodarone for rhythm control.
* CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is taking ASA and Simvastatin.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue ampicillin for enterococcus
* Monitor SBP and allow it to drop to the 80s during sleep
* Continue holding BP meds
* Send smear for thrombocytopenia
* No HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
* Hold Coumadin and continue to monitor INR
* Continue ASA, Simvastatin, and Metoprolol when pressures improve
* Trend creatinine and monitor for hypovolemic hypotension
* Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. He was admitted with a central line in place, which grew out enterococcus, a bacteremia that was sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. He was started on ampicillin IV q4h and has been receiving small boluses of normal saline to maintain blood pressure. His creatinine is elevated, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. He has a pacemaker and is scheduled for an ICD upgrade. He also has a history of diabetes and is taking medications for it.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia could lead to endocarditis, a serious infection of the heart valves.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could worsen, leading to seizures and coma.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation increases his risk of future cardiac arrest.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and history of chronic kidney disease increase his risk of renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's bacteremia could lead to a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases his risk of bleeding.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and electrolyte-rich IV fluids increases his risk of electrolyte imbalance.
10. Metabolic Complications: The patient's use of insulin and other medications increases his risk of metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus [**Last Name (un) 206**] to vanco and amp.
   Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted with +GPC x 1
   bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from [**1-1**]. Pt was
   started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric treatment and
   concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt also has a SEM
   II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records. His last
   episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling better.. BP
   since admission have also been noted to be slightly below pt's baseline
   (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in ED. Pt
s ED
   cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.  Initially
   there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive so quickly
   and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed after
   speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - Echo to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary pt was due to
   have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 90s during sleep
   - Will continue bolus NS pen, caution as pt has EF of 20-25%
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo today
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning.  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend [**Hospital1 **]
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold Heparin gtt in case he needs to undergo any
   procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: Pt's current Creatinine noted to be back to his lowest level of
   1.1, on review of [**Hospital **] rehab records show his lowest Creatinine to be
   1.25 from several days ago. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded
   to fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend Creatinine
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. His bacteremia was caused by enterococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. He was started on ampicillin IV q4h after the vancomycin and ceftriaxone were discontinued.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.2°C (95.4°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (75-79)
* Blood pressure: 116/57 mmHg (71-118/78 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Ventricular-paced

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 92 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 78 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L

The patient's medical history includes:

* Cardiac arrest
* Atrial fibrillation
* Ventricular fibrillation
* Pacemaker implantation
* NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus)
* CAD (coronary artery disease)
* V. fib (ventricular fibrillation)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia-induced endocarditis, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Hypotension, which can worsen organ dysfunction and increase the risk of septic shock.
4. Hyponatremia, which can exacerbate hypotension and lead to cerebral edema.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation, which can worsen cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory failure, which can worsen oxygenation and ventilation.
7. Kidney injury, which can worsen fluid overload and increase the risk of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.
8. Infection of the pacemaker wires, which can lead to further bacteremia and endocarditis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for enterococcus
* Fluid hydration to treat hypotension and hyponatremia
* Monitoring of vital signs and lab results to track the patient's response to treatment
* Cardiology consult to determine the need for pacemaker removal or upgrade
* Electrolyte monitoring to prevent hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia
* Close monitoring for signs of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3497**] has high grade enterococcal bacteremia and is on IV
   Ampicillin q 4 hrs. he has remained hemodynamically stable with no
   features of peripheral embolic phenomena.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98 BP of 105/76 HR of 85 RR of 14 with sats of
   100% on RA.  His chest is clear to auscultation and I do not appreciate
   a new cardiac murmer.
   Labs notable for WBC of5.7 K, HCT of 25.5 , K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.0  CXR
   with mild increased interstitial changes at left base.
   Agree with plan to continue IV antibiotics, follow surveillance
   cultures and resite RIJ line  to PICC or Midline once blood cultures
   are clean. He will need a TEE in next 48 hrs and we will arrange for
   transfer to step down cardiology service if no hemodynamic setbacks
   today. Suspicion for source other than valvular or other endovascular
   site is low. Cardiology service is aware.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable but prognosis is guarded.

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
    # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
   # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
   # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
    # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 3497**] has high grade enterococcal bacteremia and is on IV
   Ampicillin q 4 hrs. he has remained hemodynamically stable with no
   features of peripheral embolic phenomena.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98 BP of 105/76 HR of 85 RR of 14 with sats of
   100% on RA.  His chest is clear to auscultation and I do not appreciate
   a new cardiac murmer.
   Labs notable for WBC of5.7 K, HCT of 25.5 , K+ of 3.8 , Cr of 1.0  CXR
   with mild increased interstitial changes at left base.
   Agree with plan to continue IV antibiotics, follow surveillance
   cultures and resite RIJ line  to PICC or Midline once blood cultures
   are clean. He will need a TEE in next 48 hrs and we will arrange for
   transfer to step down cardiology service if no hemodynamic setbacks
   today. Suspicion for source other than valvular or other endovascular
   site is low. Cardiology service is aware.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable but prognosis is guarded.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
    # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. He has a pacemaker and is scheduled for an ICD upgrade. He was recently hospitalized for a 6-minute episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest. His recent laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.5
* Hct: 23.1
* Plt: 92
* Cr: 1.1
* Glucose: 144
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 128 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 77 (75-85) bpm
* BP: 131/56 (74) mmHg
* RR: 18 (14-27) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, and tone not assessed

The patient has the following medical issues:

* Enterococcus bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. The patient was started on empiric treatment with Flagyl and ampicillin.
* Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive to 70 mmHg overnight and responded to a 500cc bolus. His BP is being closely monitored.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 99, which is below his baseline of 200-300. The cause is unclear, and a smear will be sent.
* sCHF: The patient has an EF of 20-25% and is on metoprolol and spironolactone.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 131, which is stable and likely due to hypovolemic hypotension.
* A. Fib: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and amiodarone. His EKG shows sinus rhythm, but it is difficult to read due to the ventricular pattern from the pacemaker.
* CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is taking ASA and simvastatin.
* CRI: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0, which appears to have responded to fluid hydration and is likely pre-renal.
* History of V. fib: The patient was recently admitted to CCU following a 6-minute episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and organ failure due to enterococcus bacteremia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation
* Thrombotic events due to thrombocytopenia
* Fluid overload due to hypovolemic hypotension and pre-renal azotemia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to hyponatremia and hypokalemia
* Infection due to the presence of a central line and prophylactic antibiotics
* Delayed healing due to malnutrition and poor glycemic control."

   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be removed in light
   of bacteremia
 new pacer placement delayed given bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - will keep IJ line in for now, possible PICC tomorrow, will need to
   send tip for culture
   # Hypotension: Overnight was hypotensive to 70
s while sleeping and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] t100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic throughout.
   Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.  On presentation to
   the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be hypotensive with SBP will continue small
   500cc bolus. Pt likely hypovolemic given his reported decrease in urine
   output over the past few days and Creatinine of 1.3. Last night pt
   SBP decreased to low 80s, however he was mentating well. Given his low
   Hct a unit was type and cross matched last night however his BP
   responded to a 250cc bolus. Given his poor EF and the fact that he
   received 4l in the ED transfusion was delayed to due concerns of
   inducing a hypervolemic state. Would accept a sBP of 90s when pt is
   sleeping as long as he is mentating well.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - 1 unit has been cross matched
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  99 this morning, baseline 200-300, unclear cause,
   has been recently hospitalized and likely received heparin products.
   INR 2.2.
   - will send smear
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's hypotensive state
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   -Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.
    # Hyponatremia: 131 this morning, stable  Most likely 2/2hypovolemic
   hypotension,
   - trend daily
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.
   - continue to hold coumadin as he is therapeutic
   - will need heparin gtt once subtherapeutic in case he needs to undergo
   any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: 1.0 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely is pre-renal will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, bacteremia, and possible endocarditis. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/56 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5-4.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 23.1-25.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 92-123 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26-30 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's blood cultures grew out Enterococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. He was started on ampicillin and vancomycin, and the antibiotics were discontinued after speciation.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, and a holosystolic murmur over the right upper sternal border. He has 2+ peripheral pulses, and his neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's medical history is significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of ventricular fibrillation and has been hospitalized recently for cardiac rehabilitation.

The patient's current medications include:

* Metoprolol 25mg daily
* Spironolactone 25mg daily
* Aspirin 81mg daily
* Simvastatin 40mg daily
* Lisinopril (discontinued)
* Glargine insulin
* ISS (insulin sliding scale)

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Monitor for signs of sepsis and bacteremia
* Continue antibiotics for Enterococcus
* Monitor for signs of hypotension and hypovolemia
* Monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia
* Monitor for signs of hyponatremia
* Continue anticoagulation therapy
* Continue to hold Coumadin and Amiodarone
* Continue to monitor for signs of cardiac dysfunction

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Bacteremia and endocarditis
* Hypotension and hypovolemia
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding
* Hyponatremia and electrolyte imbalance
* Cardiac dysfunction and heart failure
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia

   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially there was concerning that pt
s bld cultures turned positive
   so quickly and he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were
   d/c'ed after speciation
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heapin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # CRI: 1.1 this morning. Pt's Creatinine appears to have responded to
   fluid hydration and most likely was elevated secdonary to pre-renal
   causes will continue to trend.
   -Trend
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD whilst there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   # NIDDM: Will continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will
   place on Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sCHF, CAD, HTN, NIDDM, and A-fib. He has a history of V-fib arrest and is currently on pressor support. His recent blood cultures grew out Enterococcus, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. He was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone, which were discontinued after speciation. He has a pacemaker and is scheduled to have an ICD upgrade.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.1°C
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C
* HR: 77 bpm
* BP: 131/56 mmHg
* RR: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%

His physical examination is notable for:

* Elderly male lying in bed in NAD
* HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, MMM, OP clear
* COR: RRR, normal S1 S2, holosystolic II/VI murmur noted over Rt Upper sternal border
* PULM: CTAB
* ABD: + BS, soft NTND
* EXT: 2+ pulses
* NEURO: Alert and appropriate

His lab results show:

* WBC: 8.5
* Hct: 23.1
* Plt: 123
* Cr: 1.1
* Glucose: 144
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 20.3/30.2/1.9, ALT / AST: 24/21, Alk Phos / T Bili: 53/1.1, Differential-Neuts: 74.7%, Lymph: 17.2%, Mono: 4.3%, Eos: 3.6%, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.9 g/dL, LDH: 128 IU/L, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise:

* Sepsis due to bacteremia
* Endocarditis due to pacemaker infection
* Hypotension due to pressor support withdrawal
* Thrombocytopenia due to heparin products
* Hyponatremia due to fluid overload
* A-fib due to rhythm control medications
* CAD due to stress and hypotension
* NIDDM due to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia

Assessment and plan:

* Continue antibiotics for Enterococcus
* Monitor BP and adjust pressor support as needed
* Continue heparin products for thrombocytopenia
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and endocarditis
* Continue cardiac and diabetic diet
* Monitor for signs of hypotension and hypovolemia
* Continue anticoagulation therapy
* Consider adding back ACEI or Lisinopril once recovered from acute illness."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including sCHF, CAD, HTN, NIDDM, and a-fib on coagulation. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Enterococcus bacteremia, and is currently being treated with ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/56 mmHg. His respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 97% on RA. His neurological status is alert and appropriate.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is currently 123, which is lower than his baseline of 200-300. The cause of this thrombocytopenia is unclear, but may be related to recent hospitalization and heparin products. Further monitoring is needed to determine if this is a persistent problem.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension in the past, including a recent episode where his blood pressure dropped to 70 mmHg. He was treated with a 500cc bolus and his pressure increased to 100 mmHg. His blood pressure is currently stable, but will need to be monitored closely to ensure that it remains stable.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is currently 8.9 g/dL, which is lower than his baseline of 10-12 g/dL. His hematocrit is stable at 25.6%. Further monitoring is needed to determine if this is a persistent problem.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is currently 137 mmol/L, which is within normal limits. However, his serum sodium level was previously low, and he may need to be monitored for signs of hyponatremia in the future.
5. A-fib: The patient has a history of a-fib, and his current EKG shows sinus rhythm. However, his pacemaker is still in place, and he may need to have it removed in the future. He is currently being treated with heparin for anticoagulation.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and is currently being treated with ASA and simvastatin. He will need to continue these medications to manage his CAD.
7. History of V. fib: The patient has a history of V. fib arrest, and is currently being treated with a pacemaker and heparin for anticoagulation. He is scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)**].

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed. Further monitoring and management are needed to ensure that these complications do not worsen his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo Male with sCHF (EF 20-25% on TTE on [**11-28**]), CAD s/p CABG (3 vs 4?
   vessel), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, s/p PPM, s/p recent CCU stay
   for VF arrest requiring pressor support, h.o. Pseudomonas + bld
   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with Enterococcus bacteremia, which requires continued treatment with antibiotics. There is a risk of bacteremia spreading to other parts of the body, such as the heart valves, and causing endocarditis.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone cardiac surgery, which increases the risk of endocarditis. The patient's echocardiogram (TTE) has shown a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%, which is concerning for endocarditis.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension on two occasions, which may be related to his underlying cardiac condition, medication, or infection. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent further episodes.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 123, which may be related to his recent hospitalization, heparin products, or infection. Further monitoring and potential treatment with platelet transfusions may be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 25.6, but further monitoring and potential transfusions may be necessary to prevent complications.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has resolved, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent future episodes.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. Close monitoring and potential treatment with anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently on a pacemaker. Close monitoring and potential treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications may be necessary.
9. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including bacteremia, which increases the risk of further infections. Close monitoring and potential treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued treatment with antibiotics for Enterococcus bacteremia.
2. Monitoring of blood pressure to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
3. Close monitoring of platelet count to prevent further thrombocytopenia.
4. Monitoring of hemoglobin level to prevent anemia.
5. Close monitoring of sodium level to prevent hyponatremia.
6. Treatment with anticoagulation therapy to prevent atrial fibrillation.
7. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm to prevent cardiac arrest.
8. Potential treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Close monitoring for signs of infection and potential treatment with antibiotics.

The patient's medical history includes:

1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiac arrest.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Cardiac surgery (CABG).
5. Pacemaker implantation.
6. Recent hospitalization for VF arrest.
7. History of NIDDM.

   cultures admitted from cardiac rehab for fevers and bacteremia.
   # Enterococcus Bacteremia: Cultures grew out enterococcus sensitive to
   vanco and amp.  Did not meet SIRS criteria on admission. Pt admitted
   with +GPC x 1 bottle from cardiac rehab which grew within 24 hours from
   [**1-1**]. Pt was started in rehab on Flagyl (day #1 [**2195-1-1**]) for empiric
   treatment and concerned for infection of pacemaker wires. Of note pt
   also has a SEM II/VI murmur that may be new - unclear from old records.
   His last episode of fever was day of admission and he is feeling
   better.. BP since admission have also been noted to be slightly below
   pt's baseline (110-120s) in the low 100s pt had central line placed in
   ED. Pt
s ED cultures from admission turned positive 4/4 bottles +GPC.
   Initially he was started on vanco and ceftriaxone which were d/c'ed
   after speciation when he was placed on ampicillin.
   - f/u and send survaillence cultures
   - TEE per cardiology to assess for endocarditis (also from d/c summary
   pt was due to have a repeat echo to check EF) - already ordered
   - Appreciate cardiology consult to determine if pacer needs to be
   removed in light of bacteremia
   - continue ampicillian for enterococcus (sensitive to vancomycin)
   - Will need PICC for long term antibiotics; once placed his IJ can be
   pulled.
   # Hypotension: Two nights agao he  was hypotensive to 70
s while
   sleeping and rose to the 100
s upon awakening, patient was asymptomatic
   throughout. Recevied 500cc bolues with increase in pressures.
   Overnight last night he maintained his pressures (lowest SBP was in the
   90
s).  Would accept a sBP of 80s when pt is sleeping as long as he is
   mentating well when awoken.
   - Monitor SBP. Allow SBP 80s during sleep
   - continue holding BP meds
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Increased to 123 this morning, baseline 200-300,
   unclear cause, has been recently hospitalized and likely received
   heparin products. INR 1.9.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been dilutional from all of the
   fluids he
s received recently.
   - no HIT ab for now, will send if continues to trend down
   # sCHF: Pt has EF of 20-25% during an Echo following his admission for
   V fib arrest. Pt currently on Metoprolol 25mg daily, Spironolactone
   25mg daily
   - hold  BP regimen given pt's recent hypotension
   - Will be cautious with IVF hydration given low EF
   - Echo as above
   - Pt currently not on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 284**] on last CCU hospitalization pt was on
   Lisinopril but d/c'd without it.  Consider adding back once recovered
   from his acute illness.
   #  Anemia: The patient
s Hct has been in the mid 20
s, today is stable
   at 25.6.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue to trend with a daily Hct.
   - No current idication for transfusion.
    # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Na 137 today.
    # A. Fib: Pt has history of A. fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone for
   rhythm control. EKG shows sinus rhythm, dificult to read p waves given
   ventricular pattern from pacemaker.  As he will likely have the pacer
   removed, will not restart coumadin (INR 1.9 today).
   - will start a heparin gtt for anticoagulation in case he needs to
   undergo any procedures.
   # CAD: Will continue ASA, Simvastatin. Will continue Metoprolol when
   pt's presures improve.
   # History of V. fib: Pt was recently admitted to CCU following a 6
   minute episode of V. fib arrest. He currently has a PPM, he is
   scheduled to have an ICD upgrade and possible LV lead on [**1-9**] with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cardiology is aware of his admission and currently and no
   plans for ICD while there is a question he may be bacteremic.
   - Appreicate cards consult, will f/u recs.
   # NIDDM: BS generally well-controlled.
   - Continue ISS and Glargine and monitor CBGs QAC+QHS. Will place on
   Cardiac/Diabetic diet.

   Surveillance cultures have been clean thus far. He remains on IV
   Ampicillin for high grade enterococcal bacteremia.

   , plts of 123K , K+ of 3.4, Cr of 1.1 .No new culture data.
   Agree with plan to proceed with TEE in am [**1-6**]. He will transfer to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including sCHF (EF 20-25%), CAD (s/p CABG), HTN, NIDDM, A-fib on coagulation, and a recent episode of VF arrest.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for fevers and bacteremia, and was found to have Enterococcus bacteremia, which is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin. He was started on ampicillin and has been receiving IV antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tm of 98.6, BP of 126/77, HR of 88, RR of 10, and SpO2 of 99% on RA. His lab results show WBC 4.8 K, HCT of 25.6, plts of 123K, K+ of 3.4, Cr of 1.1, and Na of 137.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a Tm of 98.6, BP of 126/77, HR of 88, RR of 10, and SpO2 of 99% on RA. His RII site is clean.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue IV ampicillin for high-grade Enterococcus bacteremia
* Proceed with TEE in the morning
* Transfer to the cardiology floor today
* Place PICC line after TEE procedure
* Continue IV antibiotics for at least 6 weeks if endocarditis is confirmed
* Monitor for thrombocytopenia and consider sending a HIT antibody test if platelet count continues to trend down
* Continue ASA, Simvastatin, and Metoprolol when the patient's pressures improve
* Consider adding back Lisinopril once the patient has recovered from his acute illness
* Monitor for anemia and continue to trend with a daily Hct
* Continue to monitor for hyponatremia and adjust Na levels as necessary
* Continue to monitor for A-fib and consider restarting Coumadin if the patient undergoes any procedures

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia is sensitive to vancomycin and ampicillin, but the possibility of endocarditis needs to be considered, especially given the patient's history of CAD and sCHF.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and further decline could lead to bleeding complications.
* Hypotension: The patient's BP has been low, and further drops could lead to organ dysfunction.
* Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but further decline could lead to fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's Na levels are normal, but further drops could lead to seizures and coma.
* A-fib: The patient's history of A-fib on Coumadin and Amiodarone, and the possibility of restarting Coumadin, makes it important to monitor for A-fib and adjust treatment as necessary."
