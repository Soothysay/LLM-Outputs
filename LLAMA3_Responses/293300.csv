   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   Improved today
   [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by resuming both spironolactone and bactrim at
   recent discharge. EKG with peaked T's
   - Kayexalate
   - glucose/insulin, bicarb. holding on calcium given hyper Ca
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Follow K daily
   .
   * Hypercalcemia
   Patient was hypercalcemic at last admit, with improvement with holding
   calcium supplements per DC summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Has
   been evaluated in endocrinology clinic and thought to be [**1-8**] high doses
   of calcitriol.
   - Holding calcium/D
   - IVF as above, follow
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Replete Mag
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Follow stool output
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, who was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy. She is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The patient has been treated for hyperkalemia with insulin/glucose, bicarbonate, and kayexalate, and her Na level has been corrected rapidly post-2L saline in the ER. She is also receiving IVF for treatment of Na and Ca.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and hyponatremia suggest that she may be experiencing worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and leukocytosis suggest that she may have an underlying infection, which could be exacerbated by her altered mental status and hyponatremia.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may lead to further electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypernatremia, if not properly managed.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's recent treatment with 2L saline and her current IVF may lead to fluid overload, which could worsen her hyponatremia and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's ileus and soft abdomen may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or bowel obstruction, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Opiate Withdrawal: The patient's recent discontinuation of oxycodone and neurontin may lead to opiate withdrawal symptoms, such as tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of secondary adrenal insufficiency and her current treatment with home prednisone may lead to adrenal insufficiency if not properly managed.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely to prevent further imbalances.
2. Continue IVF for treatment of Na and Ca, and monitor the patient's response.
3. Administer lactulose and rifaximin to manage her hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's WBC and leukocytosis to rule out underlying infection.
5. Consider administering antibiotics empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and consider administering magnesium to manage her hypomagnesemia.
7. Monitor the patient's opiate withdrawal symptoms and consider administering acetaminophen for fever management.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of ascites on ultrasound suggest a possible underlying infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending to determine the cause.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and hyponatremia may be related to worsening hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient is on lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still low despite rapid correction with saline in the emergency department. The patient's fluid balance is being monitored, and diuretics are being held for now.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to dehydration, low-grade fever, and possible opiate withdrawal.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate a possible infection, and blood and urine cultures are pending to determine the cause.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are still elevated, and the patient is being treated with kayexalate, glucose, and insulin to manage this condition.
7. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are still elevated, and the patient is being treated with IVF and follow-up with endocrinology to manage this condition.
8. Dilated Bowel: The patient's abdominal x-ray shows dilated bowel, which may be related to hypomagnesemia. The patient is being treated with magnesium supplements and serial abdominal exams.
9. Wrist Pain: The patient's wrist pain may be related to a possible fracture, and the patient is being placed in a splint and discussed with orthopedics.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and the patient is being followed closely to monitor for any changes.

The patient's condition is complex, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors and sodium also improved. WBC is elevated,
   concerning for possible underlying infection. No ascites to tap per
   ultrasound report. Worsened hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a
   concern given recent hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible
   precipitant of encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest
   meningitis. She is on multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone
   and neurontin, which may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS
   bleeding and seizure seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens

   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   - Goal I/O even
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - Change abx to levo/flagyl for possible HAP/aspiration PNA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, who was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and has returned with altered mental status and profound hyponatremia. She has undergone rapid correction of sodium levels with 2L of saline in the emergency department and has been treated for hyperkalemia with insulin/glucose, bicarbonate, and kayexalate. The patient is currently receiving lactulose and rifaximin for possible underlying infection and has been placed on a nasogastric tube for possible ileus. She is also receiving insulin sliding scale for diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and hyponatremia may be indicative of worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which can be a life-threatening complication of liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and possible underlying infection may lead to sepsis, which can be a life-threatening condition.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other electrolyte imbalances, which can be life-threatening.
4. Ileus: The patient's possible ileus may lead to bowel obstruction, which can be a life-threatening complication.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of secondary adrenal insufficiency and recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy may increase her risk of adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding complications, which can be life-threatening.
7. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, kidney damage, and other complications, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
2. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for possible underlying infection and monitor the patient's response.
3. Continue insulin sliding scale for diabetes management and monitor the patient's blood sugar levels.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and hepatic encephalopathy symptoms closely and adjust treatment as necessary.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency who was recently hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy. She was found to be profoundly hyponatremic and has altered mental status. The patient is on multiple sedating medications, including oxycodone and neurontin, which may be contributing to her somnolence. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC, hyperkalemia, and hypercalcemia. The patient has a history of liver disease, and the current presentation is likely related to liver dysfunction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy, there is a concern that it may worsen.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and lack of ascites suggest a possible underlying infection.
3. Volume depletion: The patient's hyponatremia and tachycardia suggest volume depletion, which may be exacerbated by the patient's recent restart of spironolactone.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be exacerbated by the patient's recent discharge from the hospital and the resumption of spironolactone and bactrim.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may be related to the patient's history of liver disease and the use of calcitriol.
6. Ileus: The patient's dilated bowel on CXR and KUB c/w ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia.
7. Wrist fracture: The patient's wrist pain and radiographs suggesting a possible wrist fracture may be related to the patient's known osteoporosis.
8. Addisonian crisis: The patient's adrenal insufficiency and recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy may put the patient at risk for an Addisonian crisis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IVF for treatment of Na, Ca, and hyperkalemia.
2. Hold oxycodone and neurontin and consider alternative pain management options.
3. Place NGT and consider rifaximin and lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including electrolyte levels, WBC count, and liver function tests.
5. Consider holding diuretics and adjusting the patient's fluid management plan based on the patient's response to treatment.
6. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider acetaminophen for fever control.
7. Continue to follow the patient's infectious workup and consider broadening the differential diagnosis to include atypical pneumonia and C. difficile infection.
8. Monitor the patient's bowel movements and consider serial abdominal exams to monitor for signs of ileus.
9. Consider placing the patient in a splint for wrist pain and discussing the patient's wrist fracture with orthopedics.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 112 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/66 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a dry mouth, regular first and second heart sounds, and a systolic murmur throughout the precordium. Her lungs are clear to anterior examination, and her abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds and mild right upper quadrant tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypercalcemia. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and her platelet count is low. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels.

The patient's medical conditions include cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal insufficiency. She has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and has recently been hospitalized for this condition.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Worsening of hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and hyponatremia suggest that her hepatic encephalopathy may be worsening.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of ascites on abdominal ultrasound suggest that she may have an underlying infection.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be exacerbated by resuming spironolactone and bactrim at recent discharge.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be due to dehydration, poor oral intake, and recent hospitalization.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be multifactorial, including dehydration, low-grade fever, and possible opiate withdrawal.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis suggests possible infection, which may be atypical pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or Clostridioides difficile infection.
7. Dilated bowel: The patient's dilated bowel on CXR may be due to hypomagnesemia, which may be exacerbated by her recent hospitalization.
8. Wrist pain: The patient's wrist pain may be due to a possible fracture, which may be related to her known osteoporosis.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to her underlying medical conditions, including cirrhosis and adrenal insufficiency.
10. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may be worsening, which may be exacerbated by her recent hospitalization and treatment with glucocorticoids.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes, and secondary adrenal insufficiency who was hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy. She was found to be profoundly hyponatremic and had altered mental status. Her conditions include tachycardia, leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, dilated bowel on CXR, wrist pain, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, asthma, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of liver disease and recent hospitalization, there is a high risk of worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to further decline in mental status and increased mortality.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of underlying infection, which can be life-threatening in a patient with compromised immune function.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and tachycardia indicate a potential fluid imbalance, which can lead to cardiovascular instability and organ dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia require close monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's dilated bowel on CXR and soft abdomen may indicate gastrointestinal motility disorders or obstruction, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, perforation, or bowel obstruction.
6. Osteoporosis-Related Complications: The patient's wrist pain and osteoporosis may increase the risk of fractures and other osteoporosis-related complications.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's secondary adrenal insufficiency requires close monitoring and management to prevent adrenal crisis and other complications.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory rate may indicate respiratory compromise, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IVF for treatment of Na, Ca, and other electrolyte imbalances.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust IVF as necessary.
3. Perform regular blood and urine cultures to monitor for infection.
4. Hold oxycodone and neurontin and consider alternative pain management options.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider serial abdominal exams and stool output to monitor for gastrointestinal complications.
7. Monitor the patient's wrist pain and consider imaging studies to rule out fractures or other osteoporosis-related complications.
8. Continue home prednisone and monitor the patient's adrenal function closely.
9. Consider consultation with endocrinology and orthopedics to optimize treatment and management of the patient's conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic now back to baseline from MS status.
   * Altered mental status
   Now improved seems most likely [**1-8**] dehydration and hyponatremia with
   some component of hepatic encephalopathy. No obvious infectious
   etiology (neg blood and urine clx).
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below) and underlying dehydration
   (can stop once taking PO)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - can D/c NGT if taking PO ok
   - rifaximin and lactulose to cont
   - LOW dose oxycodone for pain.
   * Hyponatremia
   - slowly correcting with re-hydration.
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for today and when restart would start a lower dose
   .* Leukocytosis
   No obv source of infection. Would favor brief 5 day course of Levo and
   flagyl given that all clx are neg
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Follow stool output
   * Wrist pain
   - per ortho no wrist fracture
   - splint if pain
   * Cirrhosis
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Trend LFTs, INR
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   * Adrenal insufficiency
   Continue home prednisone, BP stable and mental status improved arguing

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She has been hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and has presented with altered mental status, which has improved with treatment. 

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are improving, but there is concern for intravascular volume depletion due to recent diuretic use and poor oral intake. The plan is to repeat electrolyte levels at 1 pm and resume saline goal correction if sodium levels are stable.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, but there is no obvious source of infection. A brief 5-day course of Levo and Flagyl is being considered.
3. Dilated bowel: The patient has dilated loops of bowel on CXR, which may be due to hypomagnesemia. The plan is to follow stool output and trend LFTs, INR, and liver function tests.
4. Wrist pain: The patient has wrist pain, but no wrist fracture has been detected. A splint is recommended if pain persists.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and rifaximin and lactulose are being continued to manage this condition.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has secondary adrenal insufficiency, and she will continue to take home prednisone. There is no indication of an Addisonian crisis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Intravascular volume depletion: The patient's sodium levels are improving, but there is concern for intravascular volume depletion due to recent diuretic use and poor oral intake.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection. However, all cultures are negative, and the patient is not showing signs of sepsis.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, and the condition may recur if the patient's liver function worsens.
4. Adrenal crisis: The patient has secondary adrenal insufficiency, and there is a risk of an Addisonian crisis if the patient's cortisol levels drop too low.
5. Wrist fracture: Although no wrist fracture has been detected, the patient's wrist pain may indicate a fracture that has not been diagnosed.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has dilated loops of bowel, which may indicate gastrointestinal obstruction or ischemia. The patient's liver function tests and INR should be closely monitored to detect any signs of worsening liver disease."

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. She was previously hospitalized for hepatic encephalopathy and is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hyponatremia, and leukocytosis. Her condition has improved over the past 24 hours, with improving mental status and normalization of sodium levels. She is receiving IV fluids for treatment of dehydration and hyponatremia, and blood and urine cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy and ongoing liver dysfunction increase the risk of further liver failure and encephalopathy.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to seizures, brain edema, and respiratory arrest if not corrected promptly.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
4. Dilated bowel: The patient's dilated bowel may indicate bowel obstruction or ileus, which could lead to bowel perforation and peritonitis if not treated promptly.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's secondary adrenal insufficiency increases the risk of adrenal crisis if not managed properly.
6. Wrist pain: The patient's wrist pain may indicate a fracture or soft tissue injury, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and ongoing medical conditions increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids for treatment of dehydration and hyponatremia.
2. Monitor the patient's sodium levels closely and correct any further abnormalities promptly.
3. Repeat blood and urine cultures to rule out underlying infections.
4. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's dilated bowel and rule out bowel obstruction or ileus.
5. Continue to manage the patient's adrenal insufficiency with home prednisone and monitor for signs of adrenal crisis.
6. Splint the patient's wrist if pain persists to prevent further injury.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and liver function closely to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   Improved today
   [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by resuming both spironolactone and bactrim at
   recent discharge. EKG with peaked T's
   - Kayexalate
   - glucose/insulin, bicarb. holding on calcium given hyper Ca
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Follow K daily
   .
   * Hypercalcemia
   Patient was hypercalcemic at last admit, with improvement with holding
   calcium supplements per DC summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Has
   been evaluated in endocrinology clinic and thought to be [**1-8**] high doses
   of calcitriol.
   - Holding calcium/D
   - IVF as above, follow
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Replete Mag
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Follow stool output
   .
   * Wrist pain
   Question of wrist fracture on plain films. Pt with known osteoporosis.
   - Place in splint, discuss with ortho in AM
   .
   * Cirrhosis
   MELD 16 today.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Trend LFTs, INR
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Plts stable, follow
   .
   * DM
   Cover with insulin sliding scale
   .
   * Adrenal insufficiency
   Continue home prednisone, BP stable and mental status improved arguing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
   insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic encephalopathy
   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Many possible etiologies in this patient with advanced liver disease.
   Hyponatremia and hypercalcemia both potential culprits - the factor
   that she's waking up following hydration in the ER suggests that these
   were important factors. WBC is elevated, concerning for possible
   underlying infection. No ascites to tap per ultrasound report. Worsened
   hepatic encephalopathy is obviously a concern given recent
   hospitalization. No evidence of GIB as possible precipitant of
   encephalopathy. No findings on exam to suggest meningitis. She is on
   multiple sedating medications such as oxycodone and neurontin, which
   may be contributing. There is no evidence of CNS bleeding and seizure
   seems unlikely. MI also less likely.
   - IVF for treatment of Na, Ca (see below)
   - blood and urine cultures
   - hold oxycodone and neurontin
   - place NGT
   - rifaximin and lactulose
   - urine and blood tox screens
   - will HOLD on LP for now given multiple other possible explanations
   for somnolence that are more likely for her
   - hold on ABG as MS improving
   .
   * Hyponatremia
   Na corrected rapidly post 2L of saline in ER yesterday, remained stable
   overnight
   Concern for intravascular volume depletion give recently restarted
   spironolactone, poor PO.
   - Repeat 1pm lytes, if Na stable will resume saline goal correction
   <=0.5meq/hr
   - HOLD diuretics for now
   .
   * Tachycardia
   Telemetry c/w sinus tach. Probably multifactorial with dehydration, and
   now also low grade temps. Consider whether opiate withdrawal could be
   contributing.
   - IVF plan as above, acetaminophen<2g/day okay for fever, continue to
   follow with infectious workup as below
   * Leukocytosis
   Suggests possible infection. CXR without evidence of pna. Could be
   atypical pna, may also mask infiltrate in setting of dehydration. Broad
   DDX including UTI, C diff given recent hospitalization. UA without any
   pyuria to suggest UTI. Absence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound
   making SBP less likely
   - Blood and urine cultures, urine legionella, CIS. sputum if making any
   - Follow CBC
   - vanc/zosyn/cipro empirically pending cultures for possible HCAP
   .
   * Hyperkalemia
   Improved today
   [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by resuming both spironolactone and bactrim at
   recent discharge. EKG with peaked T's
   - Kayexalate
   - glucose/insulin, bicarb. holding on calcium given hyper Ca
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Follow K daily
   .
   * Hypercalcemia
   Patient was hypercalcemic at last admit, with improvement with holding
   calcium supplements per DC summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Has
   been evaluated in endocrinology clinic and thought to be [**1-8**] high doses
   of calcitriol.
   - Holding calcium/D
   - IVF as above, follow
   .
   * Dilated bowel on CXR
   KUB c/w  ileus may be due to hypomagnesemia. Soft abdomen and nl
   lactate reassuring.
   - Replete Mag
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Follow stool output
   .
   * Wrist pain
   Question of wrist fracture on plain films. Pt with known osteoporosis.
   - Place in splint, discuss with ortho in AM
   .
   * Cirrhosis
   MELD 16 today.
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Trend LFTs, INR
   - Liver recommendations appreciated
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Plts stable, follow

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are critically low, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if not corrected promptly.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and kidney damage.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting possible infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which can be caused by dehydration, infection, or other underlying conditions.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Ileus: The patient's bowel is dilated, which can be caused by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, or other underlying conditions.
7. Wrist pain: The patient's wrist pain may be caused by a fracture or osteoporosis, which needs to be further evaluated.
8. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to complications such as encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
10. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is compromised, which can lead to Addisonian crisis if not managed properly.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte correction.
2. Blood and urine cultures to evaluate for possible infection.
3. Hold on oxycodone and neurontin due to sedating effects.
4. Place NGT for nutrition and hydration.
5. Rifaximin and lactulose for liver function improvement.
6. Monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances, including sodium, calcium, potassium, and magnesium.
7. Follow-up with endocrinology clinic for further evaluation and management of hypercalcemia and adrenal insufficiency.
8. Monitor and manage potential complications of cirrhosis, such as encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding.
9. Follow-up with orthopedic clinic for wrist pain evaluation and management.
10. Continue home prednisone for adrenal insufficiency management.

The patient's disposition is transfer to the floor, pending further evaluation and management of their medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   returns with altered mental status and is found to be profoundly
   hyponatremic.
   .
   * Altered mental status
   Now much improved ?back to baseline
   Probably multifactorial due to electrolyte disturbances (low Na, high
   Ca), pain meds, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible overlying
   infection (?aspiration pna). Hyponatremia likely most important as
   mental status significantly improved with correction of sodium.
   - Continue to treat hyponatremia as below
   - Rifaximin and lactulose
   - Continue levo/flagyl x5d for possibile aspiration pna
   - Follow up cultures and CIS

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, profound hyponatremia, and other laboratory abnormalities. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, pain medication, and diuretics. Her mental status has improved significantly with correction of sodium levels, and she is now more alert and awake. However, she still requires close monitoring and management of her electrolyte disturbances, infection risk, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly aspiration pneumonia, given her altered mental status and hyponatremia.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and calcium, need to be closely monitored to prevent further complications.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and hyponatremia put her at risk of developing further hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's secondary adrenal insufficiency needs to be closely monitored, and she may require further treatment to prevent adrenal crisis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk of bleeding or bruising.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were previously elevated, and she may be at risk of developing further hyperkalemia.
7. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels were previously elevated, and she may be at risk of developing further hypercalcemia.
8. Ileus: The patient's dilated bowel on CXR and hypomagnesemia/hypercalcemia may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
9. Wrist Pain: The patient's known osteoporosis and wrist pain may lead to further complications, such as fractures or osteoporosis-related injuries.
10. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic pain may require further management and treatment to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and calcium, and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection risk, including antibiotics and antifungal medications as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's chronic pain, including reintroducing opiates cautiously.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's bowel function and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's wrist pain and osteoporosis.
10. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's chronic pain and adrenal insufficiency."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 19-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. Her sodium levels have increased to 129 mg/dL, and she has been experiencing hypovolemia. She has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus type II, and shellfish allergy. She has been receiving various antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/70 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for asterixis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and asterixis may increase the risk of seizures.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis of the liver may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and recent blood glucose level of 129 mg/dL may increase the risk of hyperglycemia.
4. Infection: The patient's multiple antibiotic regimens may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Dehydration: The patient's hypovolemia and hypotension may increase the risk of dehydration.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest."

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient, a 50-year-old female with hepatitis C cirrhosis, diabetes, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and profound hyponatremia. She was treated with rapid correction of sodium, and her mental status improved significantly. The patient also had leukocytosis, which resolved, and hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia, which were resolved with treatment. She had dilated bowel on CXR, which was likely due to hypomagnesemia/hypercalcemia and opiates, and was managed with follow-up and repletion of magnesium. The patient's wrist pain was evaluated and found to be due to osteoporosis, and she was managed with pain medication. The patient's MELD score was 16, and she was managed with rifaximin and lactulose for her cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient had a possible aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. However, the patient's condition could deteriorate if the infection is not fully treated.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia was corrected, but she may still be at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, due to her underlying liver disease and medications.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy was managed with rifaximin and lactulose, but she may still be at risk for further episodes if her liver function deteriorates.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency was managed with home prednisone, but she may still be at risk for an Addisonian crisis if her adrenal function deteriorates.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia was stable, but she may still be at risk for bleeding complications if her platelet count decreases further.
6. Wrist Pain: The patient's wrist pain was evaluated and found to be due to osteoporosis, but she may still be at risk for further fractures if her bone density is not managed properly.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status was stable, but she may still be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, if her underlying lung disease is not managed properly.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status was stable, but she may still be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus, if her underlying liver disease and medications are not managed properly."
