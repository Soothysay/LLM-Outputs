You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unclear diagnosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 121/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nebulization.

The patient's laboratory results show elevations in creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (MBI), and troponin-T, which may indicate myocardial damage or ischemia. The patient is receiving heparin and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to lack of assessment in certain areas, such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory systems.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Myocardial infarction or ischemia: The elevations in CK, MBI, and troponin-T may indicate ongoing myocardial damage or ischemia, which can lead to further complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the elevations in CK and MBI may indicate potential renal damage or dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on high-flow nebulization, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress or failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevations in inflammatory markers, which may indicate the presence of an underlying infection.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin and has been transfused with packed red blood cells, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition will be necessary to address these potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Expand coverage for atypicals with Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Still volume
   overloaded, but significantly improved overnight.  Unclear what
   precipitated decompensation as patient reports good adherence to
   medication regimen and no clear dietary indiscretions.  Still, on
   conversation with family it seems patient has multiple stressors
   regarding husband's reluctance to make transition to [**Hospital3 59**]
   and likely suffered outside closely supervised environment of
   rehabilitation.  Finally, relative hypertension may have contributed to
   increased afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary
   edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue Amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 80 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of  1L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   -PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix for now
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold Isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold Hydralazine
   -Continue Amolodipine and Carvedilol, continue Clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI.
   -Iron studies
   -Guaiac stools
   -Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context of
   fluid overload.
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a significant past medical history, including coronary artery disease, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI, health care-associated pneumonia, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and relative thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but has a history of CAD and is at risk for cardiac complications. She is receiving Heparin, beta-blocker, ASA, statin, and Plavix.
* Respiratory: The patient has a right-sided infiltrate with an impressive consolidation, and is receiving oxygen therapy. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for health care-associated pneumonia.
* Renal: The patient has stage III-IV CKD and is experiencing acute kidney injury. She is receiving diuretics and will require further work-up to exclude other causes.
* Hematological: The patient has relative thrombocytopenia, and the etiology is unclear. She is receiving platelet transfusions and will require further evaluation to determine the cause.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, or electrolyte imbalances
* Hematological complications, such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia
* Infections, such as sepsis or septic shock

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Cardiovascular: Continue beta-blocker, ASA, statin, and Plavix. Monitor cardiac enzymes and EKG.
* Respiratory: Continue oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and bronchodilators. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
* Renal: Continue diuretics, monitor for signs of acute kidney injury, and consider further work-up to exclude other causes.
* Hematological: Monitor platelet count and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.
* Infections: Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock.

The patient's care plan should be individualized to address her specific needs and complications, and regular monitoring and reassessment are necessary to ensure optimal management of her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Expand coverage for atypicals with Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Still volume
   overloaded, but significantly improved overnight.  Unclear what
   precipitated decompensation as patient reports good adherence to
   medication regimen and no clear dietary indiscretions.  Still, on
   conversation with family it seems patient has multiple stressors
   regarding husband's reluctance to make transition to [**Hospital3 59**]
   and likely suffered outside closely supervised environment of
   rehabilitation.  Finally, relative hypertension may have contributed to
   increased afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary
   edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue Amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 80 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of  1L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   -PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix for now
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold Isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold Hydralazine
   -Continue Amolodipine and Carvedilol, continue Clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI.
   -Iron studies
   -Guaiac stools
   -Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context of
   fluid overload.
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with CHF exacerbation.

The patient has developed several potential medical complications:

1. NSTEMI: Elevated cardiac enzymes and ST changes on EKG, despite no chest pain, suggest a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
2. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has a right-sided infiltrate with consolidation, and worsening hypoxia, suggesting pneumonia.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient is volume overloaded, with possible precipitants including medication non-adherence, dietary indiscretion, and stressors related to her husband's reluctance to make a transition.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has worsened kidney function, likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow.
5. Relative Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has declined, with potential etiologies including worsening renal failure, relative vitamin deficiency, medication suppression, or other issues.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of B12 deficiency and received 1u pRBC, but the etiology of her current anemia is unclear.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, heparin, and diuretics, and is being monitored for cardiac enzymes, EKG changes, and other potential complications. The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has signed an ICU consent form.

The patient's laboratory results are:

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1)NSTEMI: Patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, but
   unchanged EKG and no chest pain. Patient was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started.
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Currently
   appears volume overloaded.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as
   patient reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear
   dietary indiscretions.  Still, on conversation with family it seems
   patient has multiple stressors regarding husband's reluctance to make
   transition to [**Hospital3 59**] and likely suffered outside closely
   supervised environment of rehabilitation.  Also it sounds as if
   diuresis has been difficult to managed and has probably been decreased
   below optimal level.  Finally, possible that relative hypertension may
   have contributed to increased afterload and rapid development of more
   severe pulmonary edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACEi at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 40 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of [**2-12**].5 L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   -Sputum culture when possible
   -Cefepime (renally dosed) and vancomycin (dosed per level)
   -Chest PT
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Check urine lytes and eos this PM
   -Evening blood electrolytes to recheck for hyperkalemia
   5) Coronary Artery Disease: Patient has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes are flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   likely related to demand in the setting of known, unintervenable CAD.
   Given [**Last Name (un) 2406**] patient would likely not be ideally served by cardiac
   cathterization at this time.  Continue medical therapy.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -No heparin for the moment
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and no records of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold hydralazine
   -Continue amolodipine and carvedilol, continue clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Ideally, transfusion may help with demand EKG changes but
   will hold for now given concern for TACO.
   -Iron studies (pt normocytic but Fe defic could be hidden in the
   setting of coexistent megaloblastic anemia).
   -Guiac stools
   -Transfuse if active chest pain, otherwise if still <25 in AM consider
   transfusing
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema consistent with CHF exacerbation.

The patient has developed several potential medical complications:

1. NSTEMI: The patient was ruled in on 3-2 PM with elevated enzymes, but unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She is being continued on beta-blocker, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient appears volume overloaded, and the precipitating factor is unclear. She has been started on diuretics and is being monitored closely.
3. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has a right-sided infiltrate with an impressive consolidation, and broad-spectrum coverage with cefepime and vancomycin has been initiated.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and has worsened. She is being monitored for improvement with diuresis and decreased congestion.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, but NPO for now.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -Heparin gtt
   -Repeat EKG in AM
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Currently
   appears volume overloaded.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as
   patient reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear
   dietary indiscretions.  Still, on conversation with family it seems
   patient has multiple stressors regarding husband's reluctance to make
   transition to [**Hospital3 59**] and likely suffered outside closely
   supervised environment of rehabilitation.  Also it sounds as if
   diuresis has been difficult to managed and has probably been decreased
   below optimal level.  Finally, possible that relative hypertension may
   have contributed to increased afterload and rapid development of more
   severe pulmonary edema.
   -Continue BB, ASA
   -NTG gtt, titrate SBP to 110, continue amlodipine
   -Patient is not on ACEi at baseline, will hold for recent hyperkalemia
   and [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   -Furosemide 40 mg IV PRN, aim for goal of [**2-12**].5 L negative today
   -Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided infiltrate
   with an impressive consolidation.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning it is reasonable to give broad spectrum
   coverage with cefepime and vancomycin.  Will attempt to get further
   diagnostic information with sputum cultures but unlikely to get as the
   patient is as of yet not coughing up sputum.
   -Sputum culture when possible
   -Cefepime (renally dosed) and vancomycin (dosed per level)
   -Chest PT
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   -Check urine lytes and eos this PM
   -Evening blood electrolytes to recheck for hyperkalemia
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and no records of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Will attempt to well control hypertension in the
   setting of possible flash pulmonary edema.
   -Hold isosorbide while on nitro drip
   -Hold hydralazine
   -Continue amolodipine and carvedilol, continue clonidine given concern
   for rebound
   9) Anemia: Unclear etiology.  Patient has a history of B12 deficiency
   and on repletion but current Hct is worse than baseline and no clear
   etiology.  Ideally, transfusion may help with demand EKG changes but
   will hold for now given concern for TACO.
   -Iron studies (pt normocytic but Fe defic could be hidden in the
   setting of coexistent megaloblastic anemia).
   -Guiac stools
   -Transfuse if active chest pain, otherwise if still <25 in AM consider
   transfusing
   -Type and screen
   -Hemolysis labs
   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.
   -Check for hemolysis and RBC morph smear to rule out schistocytes
   though overall presentation not suggestive of TTP or [**Doctor First Name 5779**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   etiology.  Ideally, transfusion may help with demand EKG changes but
   will hold for now given concern for TACO.
   -Iron studies (pt normocytic but Fe defic could be hidden in the
   setting of coexistent megaloblastic anemia).

   10) Relative thrombocytopenia: Unclear why patient's platelets have
   declined since previous hospitalization.  Patient has multiple
   potential etiologies including worsening renal failure and relative
   [**Name (NI) 10496**] deficiency versus medication suppression or other
   issues.  Timing of discharge and rehab stay NOT consistent with HIT.
   Clopidogrel can cause thrombocytopenia and may come to this as cause if
   persists and other causes remain unlikely.

   CXR [**2168-3-3**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was diagnosed as CHF exacerbation. The patient has been treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and oxygen therapy. She also has a history of NSTEMI, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further fluid overload, increased mortality, and decreased quality of life.
2. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient's right-sided consolidation may progress to a more severe form of pneumonia, leading to increased mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs.
3. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's worsening kidney function may lead to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased mortality.
4. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and ST changes may indicate a higher risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency and chronic inflammation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further anemia, fatigue, and decreased quality of life.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased cardiovascular risk, stroke, and mortality.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of complications, such as kidney disease, neuropathy, and retinopathy.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased cardiovascular risk, pulmonary edema, and mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuretics to manage CHF exacerbation and fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and ST changes to assess the progression of NSTEMI.
3. Manage the patient's anemia with iron supplements and consider blood transfusions if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary to manage hypertension.
5. Continue insulin sliding scale to manage diabetes.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust diuretic therapy as necessary to manage acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Continue prophylactic measures to prevent VAP and DVT."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   CXR [**2168-3-3**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with CHF exacerbation.

The patient has been diagnosed with Health Care Associated Pneumonia, Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure, NSTEMI, Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease, and Anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of CHF exacerbation, leading to increased fluid overload and respiratory distress.
2. Development of sepsis secondary to the pneumonia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Acute kidney injury can progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring further management and potential dialysis.
4. NSTEMI can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac death if not managed appropriately.
5. Anemia can worsen ischemia and increase the risk of cardiovascular events if not treated promptly.
6. Fluid overload can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. The patient's history of CAD and CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death.
8. The patient's diabetes mellitus requires close monitoring to prevent hyperglycemia, which can worsen cardiovascular complications.

The patient's current management plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for pneumonia, with a focus on Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.
2. Diuresis with Furosemide to manage fluid overload and congestion.
3. Medication adjustments to manage hypertension, including restarting Imdur and Hydralazine.
4. Continued beta-blocker therapy to manage NSTEMI.
5. Heparin infusion to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
6. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess cardiac function.
7. Regular insulin sliding scale to manage blood glucose levels.
8. Prophylaxis for stress ulcer and VAP.
9. Family meeting held, and ICU consent signed.
10. Code status: Full code.

Further work-up and management will be necessary to address the patient's ongoing medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation that is unchanged per CXR. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was contaminated with oral
   flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum culture. Shortness of breath
   may also have an anxiety component as breathing improved with Ativan
   yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - Pulmonary consult
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow despite absence of severe sCHF exacerbation, but may
   have component present
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to the ICU with worsening dyspnea, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation, Health Care Associated Pneumonia, NSTEMI, and Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further fluid overload, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of mortality.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's Health Care Associated Pneumonia may progress if not effectively treated, leading to further respiratory compromise, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to further cardiac damage, arrhythmias, and increased risk of mortality if not properly managed.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's Acute Kidney Injury may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further cardiac strain, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory compromise, increased risk of mortality, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
8. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and other underlying conditions may lead to sepsis, which can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further organ dysfunction, increased risk of mortality, and potential need for vasopressors and other supportive therapies.

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation that is unchanged per CXR. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was contaminated with oral
   flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum culture. Shortness of breath
   may also have an anxiety component as breathing improved with Ativan
   yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - Pulmonary consult
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow despite absence of severe sCHF exacerbation, but may
   have component present
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was diagnosed as CHF exacerbation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has right-sided consolidation, which is unchanged per CXR, and is being treated with Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin for health care-associated pneumonia. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%.
* Cardiac: The patient has a history of CAD and has had intermittent chest pain. She was ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, but has been chest pain-free since then. She is being treated with BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt.
* Renal: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently worsened due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is being treated with iron supplements and pRBC transfusion. Her Hct is trending down after initial appropriate bump.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is reasonably well-controlled.
* Neurological: The patient is in sinus rhythm and has no history of arrhythmia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's right-sided consolidation and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's worsening CKD and prerenal azotemia may lead to renal failure if not properly managed.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Infection: The patient's health care-associated pneumonia and CKD may increase her risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue respiratory therapy, including oxygen therapy and frequent ABG monitoring.
* Continue cardiac therapy, including BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt.
* Continue renal therapy, including diuresis with Lasix and close monitoring of serum electrolytes.
* Continue hematological therapy, including iron supplements and pRBC transfusion.
* Continue endocrine therapy, including insulin sliding scale.
* Continue neurological monitoring, including telemetry and close monitoring of cardiac rhythm.
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, anemia, and infection, and adjust therapy accordingly."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient has received multiple medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone various laboratory tests.

Summary of Progress:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, with a Tmax of 37°C and a current temperature of 36.6°C. The patient's heart rate is stable, with a range of 56-79 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, with a range of 88-110 mmHg. Respiratory rate is stable, with a range of 15-30 inspirations per minute. Oxygen saturation is 97%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 137 K/uL. Blood chemistry tests reveal elevated levels of creatinine (184 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (26 mEq/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (278 IU/L). Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating cardiac injury.
* Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to lack of assessment of radial and digital pulses. Skin examination is also incomplete. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest cardiac injury, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, or even end-stage renal disease.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, which may indicate underlying respiratory compromise. Further evaluation is necessary to rule out respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
* Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and differential may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, or even death.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's incomplete physical examination may indicate underlying gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
* Thromboembolic complications: The patient's DVT prophylaxis with SQ heparin may be insufficient to prevent thromboembolic events, which may lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the provided information, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to identify any potential medical complications and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   CXR [**2168-3-3**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral
   multifocal
   opacities are overall unchanged in extent and distribution. There is no
   evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. The
   pre-existing
   signs indicative of overhydration might have minimally decreased.
   Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has right sided
   consolidation. Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and worsening hypoxia this
   morning, will continue Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was
   contaminated with oral flora. Will attempt to get a second sputum
   culture. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan yesterday.
   - F/U CXR
   - Send sputum culture
   - Cefepime (renally dosed) and Vancomycin (dosed per level)
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 2
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   2) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Continues to
   diurese well.  Unclear what precipitated decompensation as patient
   reports good adherence to medication regimen and no clear dietary
   indiscretions.  Relative hypertension may have contributed to increased
   afterload and rapid development of more severe pulmonary edema.  Per
   Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted
   on home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   3) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   -Heparin gtt to continue until [**3-4**] at 8PM
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.  Would expect to see improvement with diuresis and
   decreased congestion though will need further work-up to exclude other
   causes.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**].
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Physical examination: The patient's peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic exams are not assessed.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, vasotec, cortisporin, ciloxan, and atenolol.
* Current medications:
	+ Heparin sodium infusion
	+ Furosemide (Lasix)
	+ Vancomycin
	+ Levofloxacin
	+ Cefipime
	+ Ativan for anxiety

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and increase the risk of pulmonary edema.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and their oxygen saturation is 97%. This may indicate early signs of respiratory compromise, which could worsen if not addressed.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected infection, but the type and severity of the infection are not specified. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase, which may indicate infection.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, which may indicate electrolyte imbalance and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
6. Nephrotoxicity: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate nephrotoxicity from the antibiotics or other medications.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and their heart rate is slightly elevated. This may indicate cardiovascular instability and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias or other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg

   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt

s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrate, and acute presentation, meeting the criteria for ARDS. The patient has a history of chronic aspirations, and her chest CT scan shows evidence of infection, chronic aspiration pneumonitis, and tracheobronchomalacia. She has been treated with antibiotics, and her respiratory support has been increased.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and a history of chronic aspirations, which increases her risk of developing pneumonia.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and has had intermittent chest pain, although cardiac enzymes were initially flat. She has been treated with medications for NSTEMI, but her cardiac enzymes are trending down.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation is not consistent with acute exacerbation of CHF, but she has been treated with medications to manage her condition.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD and has experienced acute kidney injury, which may be related to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow.
5. Rhythm: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but her cardiac enzymes were elevated, and she has a history of CAD, which increases her risk of arrhythmias.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes is reasonably well-controlled, but she is at risk of developing hypoglycemia due to her medications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is controlled with medications, but she is at risk of developing hypotension due to her medications and underlying medical conditions.
8. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions. She has received pRBCs and is being treated with medications to manage her anemia.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and respiratory support to manage the patient's pneumonia and ARDS.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and rhythm to manage her NSTEMI and arrhythmias.
3. Continue medications to manage the patient's CHF, CKD, and hypertension.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and treat it with medications and blood transfusions as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and manage it with diuretics and other medications as necessary.
6. Consider placing a stent in the patient's tracheobronchial tree to manage her tracheobronchomalacia.
7. Consider using a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the patient's cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressure."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and Vancomycin (dosed
   per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**])
   - Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu, f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s eval
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Given [**Last Name (LF) 2406**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not be ideal candidate
   for cardiac catheterization, so plan for medical management and patient
   has been chest pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt
   was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA
   - Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
   - Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will hold for [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, goal of 0.5-1L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline at baseline and currently worsened.  Likely due
   to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly given 2:1 BUN
   to Cr ratio.
   - Urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology, likely from
   poor forward flow despite absence of severe sCHF exacerbation, but may
   have component present
   - PM serum electrolytes
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Maintain active type and screen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - ABG looks fine, but pO2/FiO2 is 120 (<200mm Hg), together with acute
   presentation, bilateral pulmonary infiltrate, and presentation not due
   to CHF, she meets the criteria for ARDS
   - pulmonary consult: chest CT showed evidence of infection.  history is
   consistent with chronic aspirations, so the chest CT finding might be
   chronic aspiration pneumonitis, which explains why she has no wbc and
   afebrile. also need to rule out flu, start tamiflu.  need speech and
   swallow eval.
   - CT chest: bilateral infiltrate, consistent with infection, R>L.  also
   has R>L pleural effusion. also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
   - at about 10pm, pt ABG looked worse (PaO2 down from 114 to 62, sats
   down to 90-91%), so pt put on BiPAP 10/5, sats much better
   - A-line placed for more regular ABG checks
   - given the desats, also given 20mg IV lasix at 10pm for diuresis
   - pt has lots of anxiety because of concern for the [**Age over 90 **]-year-old husband

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was diagnosed with Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP), NSTEMI, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and anemia.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with worsening hypoxia, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. She was started on BiPAP and was briefly on high flow face mask, which she tolerated for 1.5 hours. Her chest CT scan showed bilateral consolidation (R>L), consistent with HCAP. She also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent pulmonary infections.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T, CK, and CKMB levels, indicating NSTEMI. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she has been chest pain-free. Her kidney function is impaired, with a BUN:Cr ratio of 2:1, indicating prerenal azotemia. She has anemia, iron deficiency, and chronic inflammation.

The patient is receiving treatment for HCAP, NSTEMI, and acute kidney injury, including antibiotics, antiviral medication, and diuretics. She is also receiving treatment for anemia, including transfusions and iron supplements. Her cardiac medications include beta blockers, aspirin, statins, and hydralazine.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and decreased oxygen saturation may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Sepsis: The patient's HCAP and acute kidney injury may increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
4. Acute kidney injury progression: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease, which can increase her risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
5. Anemia worsening: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Infection: The patient's HCAP and tracheobronchomalacia may increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or bronchitis.
7. Pneumothorax: The patient's tracheobronchomalacia may increase her risk of developing a pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s eval
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   -Continue BB, ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue BB, ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - Furosemide 40 mg PO, can give extra lasix for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 40mg PO BID
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - Restarted Imdur & Hydralazine as above
   - Continue home Clonidine & Carvedilol
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a significant past medical history, including CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on high flow nasal cannula oxygen and has a PaO2/FiO2 of 120 (<200mm Hg). She has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT, which are consistent with infection.
* Cardiovascular: She has a history of CAD and has had intermittent chest pain, although cardiac enzymes were flat. She was ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, unchanged EKG, and no chest pain. She is currently on medical management and has been chest pain-free.
* Renal: She has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently has acute kidney injury. Her urine electrolytes are consistent with pre-renal etiology.
* Hematology: She has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, and has received 1 unit of pRBC in the context of NSTEMI on [**3-2**].
* Neurological: She has no focal neurological deficits and is awake and oriented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT make respiratory failure a potential complication.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI make cardiac arrhythmias a potential complication.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and stage III-IV CKD at baseline make renal failure a potential complication.
* Sepsis: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT and elevated enzymes make sepsis a potential complication.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI make pulmonary embolism a potential complication.
* Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's evidence of tracheobronchomalacia on chest CT makes tracheobronchomalacia a potential complication.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of CKD and iron deficiency make gastrointestinal bleeding a potential complication.
* Infection: The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT and elevated enzymes make infection a potential complication.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan is to continue medical management, including antibiotics, antivirals, and diuretics. The patient will also be monitored closely for any signs of deterioration and will be considered for further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or stent placement, if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg

   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Health Care Associated Pneumonia, NSTEMI, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and anemia.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with worsening hypoxia and decreased lung sounds. She has been treated with antibiotics, including Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin, and has been started on tamiflu for possible flu infection. She has also been given lasix for diuresis and has been monitored closely for fluid overload.

The patient's lab results show elevated cardiac enzymes, consistent with NSTEMI, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, consistent with anemia. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and decreased lung sounds suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI make her susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's impaired renal function and elevated creatinine level suggest that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may exacerbate her cardiovascular disease and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload and decreased lung sounds suggest that she may be at risk for fluid overload and respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and flu infection make her susceptible to further infections, which could worsen her condition.
7. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI make her susceptible to cardiac ischemia, which could worsen her condition.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and antiviral medications as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and provide cardiac medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and provide diuretics as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and provide iron supplements as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and provide diuretics as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist and a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's condition and develop a plan for her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative. Patient reports that she
   chokes every time she drinks water and her chest CT would be consistent
   with persistent aspirations.  Also, patient has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent
   pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral
   flora. Patient with significant improvement in breathing and energy
   this AM. ABG stable on less FiO2 and CXR demonstrates interval
   improvement.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - Repeat TTE s/p NSTEMI as an inpatient
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Given worsening renal function and elevated BUN, consider renal
   consult & touch base with patient
s outpatient PCP
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down today after stable Hct on [**3-5**]. Hct this morning is 23.4.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s today
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative. Patient reports that she
   chokes every time she drinks water and her chest CT would be consistent
   with persistent aspirations.  Also, patient has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent
   pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral
   flora. Patient with significant improvement in breathing and energy
   this AM. ABG stable on less FiO2 and CXR demonstrates interval
   improvement.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - Repeat TTE s/p NSTEMI as an inpatient
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Given worsening renal function and elevated BUN, consider renal
   consult & touch base with patient
s outpatient PCP
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema.
* She has been diagnosed with health care-associated pneumonia, NSTEMI, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and anemia.
* She is currently in sinus rhythm and has no history of arrhythmia.
* She has been experiencing wheezing and decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/29 mmHg.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* **Pneumonia:** The patient's bilateral consolidation on chest CT and persistent aspirations may lead to recurrent pulmonary infections, worsening her respiratory status.
* **Heart Failure:** The patient's acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure may lead to worsening of her cardiac status, including decreased cardiac output and increased risk of arrhythmias.
* **Acute Kidney Injury:** The patient's worsening renal function and elevated BUN may lead to further decline in her kidney function, requiring closer monitoring and potential renal consultation.
* **Anemia:** The patient's iron deficiency and chronic inflammation may lead to further decline in her hemoglobin levels, requiring continued transfusion and erythropoietin therapy.
* **Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, including ketoacidosis and non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma, if not adequately managed with insulin and sliding scale therapy.
* **Hypertension:** The patient's hypertension may lead to further complications, including cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
* **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's presumed GI bleed may lead to further complications, including bleeding, anemia, and hypovolemic shock.

**Plan:**

* Continue medical management for health care-associated pneumonia, NSTEMI, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and anemia.
* Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely, with frequent ABG and CXR.
* Continue to adjust medications as needed to manage the patient's conditions.
* Consider renal consultation and outpatient PCP follow-up for further management of the patient's kidney disease.
* Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust insulin and sliding scale therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and adjust transfusion and erythropoietin therapy as needed.
* Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.  Flu negative.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - s/s [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Lasix today for goal of net even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Lasix today for goal of net even
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down today after stable Hct on [**3-5**]. Hct this morning is 23.4.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s today
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: cardiac/heart healthy, dysphagia diet, nectar thickened

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with CHF exacerbation.
* She has bilateral consolidation on chest CT, suggesting health care-associated pneumonia, and tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections.
* She has evidence of acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, with a 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio, suggesting prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow.
* She has anemia, iron deficiency, and chronic inflammation, with a current Hct of 23.4%.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* **Respiratory Complications:** The patient's bilateral consolidation on chest CT and tracheobronchomalacia may lead to recurrent pulmonary infections, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of CAD and current NSTEMI may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
* **Renal Complications:** The patient's acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease may progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation.
* **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's history of GI bleed and current use of omeprazole may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
* **Infectious Complications:** The patient's current pneumonia and history of tracheobronchomalacia may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or respiratory failure.
* **Metabolic Complications:** The patient's diabetes mellitus and current use of insulin sliding scale and NPH may lead to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or hypoglycemia.
* **Anemia Complications:** The patient's anemia and iron deficiency may lead to fatigue, weakness, or decreased cognitive function.

**Plan:**

* Continue medical management for CHF, including Lasix, Captopril, and Carvedilol.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
* Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock.
* Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's diabetes mellitus and anemia with insulin sliding scale, NPH, and ferrous sulfate.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider endoscopy or colonoscopy if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Patient reports that she chokes every
   time she drinks water, raising concern for persistent aspirations.  Her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Given recent stay in [**Hospital1 69**] and
   worsening hypoxia this morning, will continue
   Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture x2 was contaminated with
   oral flora. Shortness of breath may also have an anxiety component as
   breathing improved with Ativan. Patient was briefly on BiPAP for low
   PaO2, which she tolerated for 1.5h.  She did well on high flow face
   mask later.
   - continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**5-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - continue tamiflu (day 1: [**3-4**], day [**3-18**])
   - f/u on flu DFA
   - s/s [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - prior to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue to give meds with thickened liquids
   - continue aspiration precaution
   - IP consult for possible stent placement for tracheobronchomalacia in
   the future, not during the CCU stay
   - BiPAP as needed
   - O2 by facemask, frequent ABG
   - f/u Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - d/c carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - continue ASA, Simvastatin
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Patient is not on ACE-I at baseline, will start a low dose captopril
   3.25mg TID now that creatinine is at baseline
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - lasix today for goal of 0.5L negative
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   -Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Patient reasonably well controlled.
   -Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Amlodipine
   stopped.
   - continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - hold carvedilol today given substantial wheezing on exam today, will
   restart it tomorrow at a lower dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - d/c clonidine, start catapres patch today
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 1u pRBC
s in context of NSTEMI on
   [**3-2**]. Trending down after initial appropriate bump in Hct. Received
   another unit of pRBC on [**3-4**], trended down again after initial bump.
   Hct this morning is 24.9.
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - start Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY today
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, and was diagnosed with CHF exacerbation. The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and cardiac enzymes were elevated on day 1, but have since trended down. She has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, and anemia. The patient has been treated with various medications, including Cefepime, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, tamiflu, and furosemide, and has undergone various interventions, including the placement of a PICC line and an arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and has been diagnosed with health care-associated pneumonia. This increases the risk of pneumonia-related complications, such as sepsis and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure. This increases the risk of cardiac arrest, especially in the setting of electrolyte imbalances or medication non-compliance.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease. This increases the risk of kidney injury-related complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, and has received pRBCs. This increases the risk of anemia-related complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure and has been treated with furosemide. This increases the risk of respiratory failure, especially in the setting of electrolyte imbalances or medication non-compliance.
6. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with health care-associated pneumonia and has been treated with antibiotics. This increases the risk of sepsis, especially in the setting of immunocompromise or chronic illness.
7. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and has been treated with heparin. This increases the risk of thrombosis-related complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac arrest.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent kidney injury-related complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent anemia-related complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of wheezing, decreased Carvedilol dose, and presumed GI bleed causing downward Hct trend. The patient was started on Captopril, omeprazole, and Lasix IV.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a Tmax of 37.3°C, Tcurrent of 36°C, HR of 74 bpm, BP of 112/29 mmHg, RR of 20 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 92%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a net positive fluid balance of 401 mL, with a total fluid input of 1,436 mL and a total fluid output of 1,035 mL.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 8.4, Hct of 25.4%, and Plt count of 150. The patient's glucose level is 151 mg/dL, and their renal function is within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow neb and O2 delivery. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaO2 of 179, and PaCO2 of 43.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's unstable condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is high-flow neb and O2 delivery, which may not be sufficient to manage their respiratory needs.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's decreased Carvedilol dose and increased Lasix IV may indicate cardiac decompensation.
3. GI bleed: The patient's presumed GI bleed and decreased Hct trend may indicate ongoing bleeding or a worsening condition.
4. Infection: The patient's contaminated sputum culture and negative flu swab may indicate an ongoing infection or a risk of developing one.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's net positive fluid balance and high fluid input may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac failure, respiratory failure, or other complications.
6. Worsening renal function: The patient's decreased Hct trend and increased BUN may indicate worsening renal function, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose level may indicate hyperglycemia, which can lead to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, or other complications.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and optimize their clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient has bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative. Patient reports that she
   chokes every time she drinks water and her chest CT would be consistent
   with persistent aspirations.  Also, patient has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose her to recurrent
   pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral
   flora. Patient with significant improvement in breathing and energy
   this AM. ABG stable on less FiO2 and CXR demonstrates interval
   improvement.
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**6-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 4
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Cardiac enzymes trending down. Heparin gtt was discontinued
   on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - Repeat TTE s/p NSTEMI as an inpatient
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily
   - Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID today, but can restart for goal of net
   I/O even
   - Given worsening renal function and elevated BUN, consider renal
   consult & touch base with patient
s outpatient PCP
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased yesterday
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Clonidine 0.1 PO BID
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down today after stable Hct on [**3-5**]. Hct this morning is 23.4.
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s today
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, consistent with CHF exacerbation. She also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated cardiac enzymes, consistent with NSTEMI
* Chronic kidney disease with worsening renal function
* Anemia with iron deficiency and chronic inflammation
* Hyperglycemia, requiring increased insulin sliding scale and NPH
* Hypertension, resolved with restarting her home regimen

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Health Care Associated Pneumonia: patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT, and sputum culture x3 was contaminated with oral flora
* NSTEMI: patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, and cardiac catheterization is not an option due to her medical condition
* Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: patient's presentation is not consistent with acute exacerbation of CHF
* Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline, and current worsening renal function is likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow
* Anemia: patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, and is at risk for further decline in Hct
* Hypertension: patient's blood pressure is controlled with her home regimen
* Diabetes Mellitus: patient's hyperglycemia is managed with insulin sliding scale and NPH

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or CHF exacerbation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to NSTEMI or electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure due to worsening kidney disease or prerenal azotemia
* Bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy or platelet dysfunction
* Infection due to compromised immune system or invasive devices
* Malnutrition due to dysphagia or inadequate nutrition

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue Cefepime and Vancomycin for pneumonia
* Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
* Continue Captopril and Hydralazine for CHF
* Hold home Lasix and restart if necessary
* Continue to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias and renal function
* Continue insulin sliding scale and NPH for hyperglycemia
* Continue to monitor for signs of bleeding or infection
* Consider renal consult and outpatient PCP follow-up for worsening kidney disease."

   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and

   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID

   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg

   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - F/u repeat TTE

   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC

   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was diagnosed as a CHF exacerbation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia (HCAP): The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and reports choking on water, which may indicate persistent aspirations. She also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and has had intermittent chest pain, although cardiac enzymes were initially flat. However, she was ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**] PM with elevated enzymes, and her plan is for medical management.
3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation does not suggest an acute exacerbation of CHF, and she has been restarted on her home regimen of Imdur and Hydralazine.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently has a 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio, which suggests prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow.
5. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, which may be contributing to her low hemoglobin level. She has received three units of packed red blood cells and is being monitored for response.
6. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but her history of CAD and CKD may increase her risk for arrhythmias.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's hyperglycemia was managed with an increase in her insulin sliding scale and NPH.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension was resolved with restarting her home regimen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.4-8.4 K/uL
* Hct: 24.9-24.8%
* Plt: 150-146 K/uL
* Cr: 2.1-2.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 28-30 mmHg
* Glucose: [**Telephone/Fax (3) 10566**] mg/dL

The patient's medication list includes:

* Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
* ASA
* Simvastatin
* Heparin gtt
* Cefepime (renally dosed)
* Vancomycin (dosed per level)
* Levofloxacin 250mg IV q24H
* Omeprazole 20mg PO daily
* Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
* Imdur 150mg PO daily
* Hydralazine 100mg PO BID
* Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
* NPH and insulin sliding scale

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
* Continuing Cefepime and Vancomycin
* Monitoring for signs and symptoms of tracheobronchomalacia
* Restarting her home regimen of Imdur and Hydralazine
* Increasing home lasix to 80mg for goal I/O of even
* Monitoring for signs of fluid overload
* Maintaining active type and screen
* Trending CBC

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - s/s eval today
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, plavix
   - F/u repeat TTE
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   - TTE today
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - IV lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. The patient's condition has improved clinically, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions.

The patient's main medical issues include:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and reports choking when drinking water, which suggests persistent aspirations. She has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which predisposes her to recurrent pulmonary infections.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and had intermittent chest pain, but cardiac enzymes were flat. She was ruled in on day 1 with elevated enzymes, unchanged EKG, and no chest pain. She is being managed medically and has been chest pain-free.
3. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation is not consistent with an acute exacerbation of CHF. She is being managed with home medications and has had her Amlodipine held and restarted on Imdur/Hydralazine.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline. She has been receiving IV lasix prn and has had a recent unit of pRBC.
5. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, and her Hct is trending down. She has received pRBC and is being monitored.
6. Rhythm: The patient is in sinus rhythm and has no history of arrhythmia.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's insulin sliding scale and NPH have been increased in context of hyperglycemia.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has resolved with restarting her home regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's persistent aspirations and tracheobronchomalacia make her prone to recurrent pulmonary infections.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI make her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
* Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent acute kidney injury make her at risk for further kidney damage and potential progression to end-stage renal disease.
* Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency and chronic inflammation make her at risk for worsening anemia and potential blood transfusion requirements.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy make her at risk for hypoglycemia.
* Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease make her at risk for further hypertension-related complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions, including her pneumonia, NSTEMI, acute kidney injury, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. She should be continued on her current medications and therapy, and her condition should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin
   - F/u repeat TTE
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Received 2u pRBC
s with initial appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending
   down the next morning.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY
   - Guaiac stools
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine, Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1
   PO BID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was suspected to be a CHF exacerbation.

The patient's clinical condition has improved, with a decrease in oxygen requirement and improved respiratory status. However, she still requires oxygen therapy and has bilateral consolidation on chest CT, which is consistent with pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make her prone to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by her CHF.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI make her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's pre-existing CKD and recent acute kidney injury make her at risk for further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
4. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency and chronic inflammation make her at risk for anemia, which can worsen her overall condition.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes and insulin therapy make her at risk for hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent blood pressure elevation make her at risk for further hypertension-related complications.
7. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent antibiotic therapy make her at risk for further infection, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions. This includes continued oxygen therapy, antibiotic therapy, and management of her CHF, CKD, and diabetes. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on her condition and the potential complications that can arise, and a plan for code status and disposition should be discussed."

   CXR (today): pending
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with past medical history significant for CAD,
   chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with
   dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema c/w CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically.
   Patient has bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest CT. Flu negative.
   Patient reports that she chokes every time she drinks water and her
   chest CT would be consistent with persistent aspirations.  Also,
   patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which would predispose
   her to recurrent pulmonary infections.  Sputum culture x3 was
   contaminated with oral flora.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**7-21**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 5
   - s/s eval today
   - Continue to give meds with thickened liquids pending S&S evaluation
   - Continue aspiration precaution
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U final CXR read
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and has had intermittent chest pain
   though cardiac enzymes were flat.  Diffuse (mostly lateral) ST changes
   were though to be related to demand in the setting of known,
   unintervenable CAD, but patient ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain. She was continued on BB, ASA,
   statin, and Heparin gtt started. Since patient is not an ideal
   candidate for cardiac catheterization, and this bump in cardiac enzymes
   are likely secondary to pulmonary process causing heart demand
   ischemia, plan is for medical management and patient has been chest
   pain free. Heparin gtt was discontinued on [**3-4**] at 8PM.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, plavix
   - F/u repeat TTE
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to work.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - increase home lasix to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   - TTE today
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.   Urine electrolytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology, likely from poor forward flow despite absence of
   severe sCHF exacerbation.
   - IV lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - continue to monitor
   .
   9) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but  trending down the next morning.  Patient
   was given 1u pRBC yesterday for hct of 23.4, this morning hct is 24.8.
   last colonoscopy in [**2162**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine, Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1
   PO BID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a significant past medical history, including chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema, which was diagnosed as a exacerbation of chronic heart failure.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including diuretics, vasodilators, and anticoagulants, as well as antibiotics and antifungals. Her condition has been improving clinically, with decreased oxygen requirements and improved cardiac function.

However, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral consolidation on chest CT and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. She is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has had intermittent chest pain and has been diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She is at risk for further cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's condition has been complicated by acute kidney injury and fluid overload, which may worsen her heart failure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV chronic kidney disease and is at risk for further kidney injury, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia and is at risk for further anemia, including worsening kidney function and cardiac function.
6. Rhythm: The patient is at risk for arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, due to her cardiac condition and medications.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is at risk for further hyperglycemia, including diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and is at risk for further hypertension, including hypertensive crisis and cardiovascular complications.

The patient's plan of care includes continued medical management, including diuretics, vasodilators, and anticoagulants, as well as antibiotics and antifungals. She will also receive regular monitoring, including telemetry, and will be followed closely for any signs of deterioration or complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, and currently receiving treatment for suspected sepsis. She has been on ACEI, imdur, and hydral for her hypertension. She has also been receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefipime. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/29 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, except for prominent rhonchi and wheezes throughout the anterior and posterior chest with moderate aeration at the bases. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 146 x 10^9/L. Her renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's continued treatment for suspected sepsis and her laboratory results, including a low reticulocyte index and mild anemia, suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis-related complications.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction and severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and inferior walls, as seen on TTE, may put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's prominent rhonchi and wheezes throughout the anterior and posterior chest may indicate respiratory compromise, and her oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery may not be sufficient to meet her oxygen needs.
4. Renal complications: The patient's mild impairment of renal function, as seen on her laboratory results, may put her at risk for further decline in renal function or development of acute kidney injury.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting, and her current treatment with protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis, may indicate gastrointestinal compromise, and her laboratory results, including a high lactate level, may suggest gut hypoperfusion.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, but she is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, on multiple medications including ACEI, imdur, and hydral, and has been admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.1°C (98.8°F), Tcurrent 36.9°C (98.4°F), HR 61 bpm (58-77), BP 112/29 mmHg, RR 20 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on prophylactic heparin and has a PICC line and arterial line in place.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 950 mL of IV fluids and has a negative balance of 76 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG of 7.43/44/102/27/3.
* Physical examination: The patient is comfortable, with clear oropharynx, regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs. She has prominent rhonchi and wheezes throughout the anterior and posterior chest, with moderate aeration at the bases.
* Labs/Radiology: The patient's WBC count is 6.5-7.9, Hct is 24.3-26.8, and Plt is 146-202. Her Cr is 2.0-2.2, TCO2 is 28-32, and glucose is 138-231.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG values indicate mild respiratory acidosis, and her SpO2 is 95%. She may require further respiratory support or intubation if her oxygenation status worsens.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's BP is 112/29 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. She also has mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and inferior walls, which may increase her risk of cardiac complications.
* Renal impairment: The patient's Cr values are 2.0-2.2, which may indicate mild renal impairment. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and ACEI use may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. She is also receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may further increase this risk.
* Infection: The patient's WBC count is 6.5-7.9, which may indicate a mild infection. She is also receiving antibiotics, which may increase her risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridioides difficile infection.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of hypertension and ACEI use may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures. She is also receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may further increase this risk.

In conclusion, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and acute respiratory failure, who is currently receiving ICU care. She has a number of potential medical complications that can arise from her condition, including respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, renal impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Patient is improving clinically on
   broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2 requirement in the
   context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen isolated with sputum
   culture due to contamination.  Bilateral consolidation (R>L) on chest
   CT also consistent with persistent aspirations, but S&S evaluation on
   [**3-7**] was without clinically significant aspiration.  Patient also has
   evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent
   pulmonary infection.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 6
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  Patient
s home dose of Lasix (PO 40mg [**Hospital1 **])
   does not seem to be effective in diuresis.
   - Continue ASA, Hydralazine 100mg PO BID, Imdur 150mg PO daily,
   Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen.
   - Continue Imdur & Hydralazine, Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration.  Patient also has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary
   infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration.  Patient also has evidence of
   tracheobronchomalacia, predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary
   infection.
   - Wean O2 by facemask PRN with frequent ABG
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**8-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg

   - F/U S&S video evaluation
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix

   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  This was then held again when started on ACE.
   - Continue ASA, Captopril 6.25mg PO TID
   - Discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] need for Imdur/Hydralazine before restarting
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in context
   of fluid overload.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a significant medical history, including chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was diagnosed with COPD and systolic heart failure exacerbation. The patient has been improving clinically, but still requires ongoing medical management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia, which may lead to recurrent pulmonary infections. She requires continued broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring for respiratory distress.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and was ruled in for NSTEMI on [**3-2**]. She requires continued management with beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, and heparin.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation does not suggest an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF, but she requires continued management with diuretics and vasodilators.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD and requires close monitoring of her kidney function.
5. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, which may be contributing to her anemia. She requires ongoing management with iron supplements and consideration of erythropoietin.
6. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but requires continued monitoring for arrhythmias.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient requires ongoing management with insulin and sliding scale insulin.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has resolved with restarting her home regimen.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: The patient requires cardiac/heart-healthy nutrition, including thin liquids, moist ground solids, and pills in puree.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, allergies to codeine, vasotec, and atenolol, and current medications including ACEI, imdur, and hydral. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of LV systolic dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's 24-hour events include a guaiac-negative stool, normal hemolysis labs, and a retic index of 0.66 indicating marrow problems. She was started on Fe supplementation. A TTE revealed mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and inferior walls, with an LVEF of 40%. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.1°C, Tcurrent of 36.9°C, HR of 61 bpm, BP of 112/29 mmHg, RR of 20 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 95%. Her weight is 92.7 kg, and she is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 6.5-7.9 K/uL, Hct of 24.3-26.8%, Plt of 146-202, Cr of 2.0-2.2 mg/dL, and TCO2 of 28-32 mmHg. Her glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 138-231 mg/dL. Other lab results include a PT/PTT/INR of 12.9/33.1/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T of 194/19/1.03, ALT/AST of 47/45, Alk Phos/T Bili of 144/0.6, and a differential count of 87.6% neutrophils, 4.3% lymphocytes, 5.2% monocytes, and 0.5% eosinophils.

The patient's plan includes ongoing ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient is currently on a PICC line and an arterial line.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's LV systolic dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation, there is a risk of further cardiac decompensation, including heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction may lead to respiratory compromise, including hypoxia, hypercapnia, or respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hypertension and current medications may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with the use of ACEI and imdur.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of IV lines may increase the risk of infection, including sepsis or septic shock.
5. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of hypertension may increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's history of hypertension and current medications may affect her nutritional status, particularly with regard to glucose control and electrolyte balance.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's marrow problems and elevated retic index may increase the risk of bleeding or hematological complications, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria
   for ARDS. She continues to improve on abx and reduce O2 requirement.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration. Video swallow reinforced need for precautions
   but unalarming.  Patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia,
   predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary infection. Patient briefly met
   criteria for ARDS.
   - continue to Wean O2, now at 4L NC
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 7
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - aspiration precautions
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN. Heartrate
   control between 53-77 on [**3-8**]
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  This was then held again when started on ACE.
   - Continue ASA, Captopril 6.25mg PO TID. In the setting of hypotension,
   might consider lower rose (2.5 of ramipril?)
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg with ascorbic acid daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - ideal Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in
   context of fluid overload and red cell consumption
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Control may
   be overshot.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1 PO BID, Captopril
   6.25mg TID
   .
   9) Disposition: SW has been helpful in organizing family. Patient needs
   rehab on d/c and unlikely to adequately care for self at home

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria
   for ARDS. She continues to improve on abx and reduce O2 requirement.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration. Video swallow reinforced need for precautions
   but unalarming.  Patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia,
   predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary infection. Patient briefly met
   criteria for ARDS.
   - continue to Wean O2, now at 4L NC
   - Continue Cefepime (renally dosed, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]) and
   Vancomycin (dosed per level, day1: [**3-2**], day [**9-20**]),  Levofloxacin 250mg
   IV q24H, day 7
   - Ipratropium & Albuterol nebs
   - aspiration precautions
   - HOB elevation
   - F/U CXR
   - F/U Pulmonary recs
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient with h/o CAD and ruled in on [**3-2**] PM with elevated
   enzymes, unchanged EKG and no chest pain in the context of heart demand
   ischemia,. She was continued on BB, ASA, statin, and Heparin gtt per
   protocol and managed medically as she is not an ideal candidate for
   cardiac catheterization. Since then, she has been chest pain free.
   Repeat TTE on [**3-7**] demonstrates mild to moderate regional LV systolic
   dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum
   and inferior walls. LVEF = 40 %. mod MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1560**] HTN. Heartrate
   control between 53-77 on [**3-8**]
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   - Continue ASA, Simvastatin, Plavix
   .
   3) Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] felt
   patient
s presentation not c/w with acute exacerbation of sCHF. Per Dr.
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10529**], Amlodipine was held and patient restarted on
   home Imdur/Hydralazine.  This was then held again when started on ACE.
   - Continue ASA, Captopril 6.25mg PO TID. In the setting of hypotension,
   might consider lower rose (2.5 of ramipril?)
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], for goal I/O of even
   - Titrate O2 to goal of 92-93%
   .
   4) Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient has stage
   III-IV CKD at baseline and currently back to baseline.  The initial [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   was likely due to prerenal azotemia and poor forward flow particularly
   given 2:1 BUN to Cr ratio.
   - IV Lasix prn goal I/O of even
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   5) Anemia: Iron studies c/w iron deficiency & chronic inflammation.
   Patient also chronic kidney disease which could contribute low hct. Has
   been received pRBC
s (3u, the most recent unit on [**3-6**]) with initial
   appropriate rise in Hct, but then trends down.  Last colonoscopy in
   [**2162**], guaiac negative stool. Negative hemolysis labs. Hct improved
   today, will continue to monitor.
   - Touch base with outpatient PCP regarding need for EPO [**3-15**] kidney
   disease
   - Ferrous Sulfate 325mg with ascorbic acid daily
   - Protonix 40 mg PO DAILY
   - ideal Goal Hct >30 given ischemia, but this may be challenging in
   context of fluid overload and red cell consumption
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend CBC
   .
   6) Rhythm: Patient is in sinus rhythm currently and has no history of
   arrythmia.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
   .
   7) Diabetes Mellitus: Insulin sliding scale and NPH increased on [**3-5**]
   in context of hyperglycemia.
   -Continue NPH & insulin sliding scale
   .
   8) Hypertension: Resolved with restarting her home regimen. Control may
   be overshot.
   - Continue Carvedilol 25mg PO BID, Clonidine 0.1 PO BID, Captopril
   6.25mg TID
   .
   9) Disposition: SW has been helpful in organizing family. Patient needs
   rehab on d/c and unlikely to adequately care for self at home

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria for ARDS. She continues to improve on antibiotics and is being weaned off oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to her tracheobronchomalacia and recurrent pulmonary infection.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD and was ruled in for NSTEMI on admission. She is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's presentation is not consistent with an acute exacerbation of systolic CHF, but she is at risk of developing further cardiac complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage III-IV CKD and is at risk of developing further kidney damage due to her underlying condition and potential prerenal azotemia.
5. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency and chronic inflammation, which can contribute to her anemia. She is at risk of developing further anemia due to her underlying conditions.
6. Rhythm: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but is at risk of developing arrhythmias due to her underlying cardiac conditions.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is at risk of developing further hyperglycemia due to her underlying condition and potential insulin resistance.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently under control, but she is at risk of developing further hypertension due to her underlying conditions.

Action Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and wean off oxygen therapy as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with iron supplements and erythropoietin therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust medication as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medication as necessary.
7. Consider referral to a rehabilitation facility for further care and management.

Recommendations:

1. Consider adding a diuretic to the patient's medication regimen to help manage her fluid overload.
2. Consider adding a medication to help manage the patient's anemia, such as epoetin alfa.
3. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her cardiac conditions.
4. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of her kidney disease.
5. Consider referring the patient to a dietician for further evaluation and management of her nutrition and fluid intake."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   86 year old woman with PMH significant for CAD, chronic systolic CHF,
   CKD, and diabetes mellitus presenting with dyspnea on exertion, weight
   gain, and lower extremity edema c/w COPD & systolic CHF exacerbation.
   She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria
   for ARDS. She continues to improve on abx and reduce O2 requirement.
   .
   1) Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient is
   improving clinically on broad spectrum antibiotics with a decreasing O2
   requirement in the context of a negative flu swab and no pathogen
   isolated with sputum culture due to contamination.  Bilateral
   consolidation (R>L) on chest CT also consistent with persistent
   aspirations, but S&S bedside evaluation on [**3-7**] was without clinically
   significant aspiration. Video swallow reinforced need for precautions
   but unalarming.  Patient also has evidence of tracheobronchomalacia,
   predisposing her to recurrent pulmonary infection. Patient briefly met
   criteria for ARDS.

Summary:

The patient is a 86-year-old woman with a history of CAD, chronic systolic CHF, CKD, and diabetes mellitus, admitted to the ICU for dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, and lower extremity edema. She was found to have a multilobar pneumonia and briefly met criteria for ARDS. She has been improving clinically on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has reduced O2 requirement. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including NSTEMI, acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require further management to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI puts her at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or acute coronary syndrome.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury may lead to further kidney damage or require dialysis.
4. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency and chronic inflammation may worsen her anemia, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular events or increased risk of infections.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's multilobar pneumonia and chronic kidney disease may increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as sepsis or urinary tract infections.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroparesis, diarrhea, or constipation.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve her overall outcome."
