You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and rate-related left bundle branch block. The patient underwent external DC/CV with resolution of hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm with intermittent pacing.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37°C (98.6°F), Tcurrent 36.4°C (97.6°F), HR 76 (70-80) bpm, BP 132/91 mmHg, RR 14 (9-22) inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,244 mL of fluid since 12:00 AM, with a total output of 637 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 11.0, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 292,000/μL. His creatinine is 1.9 mg/dL, and his potassium is 4.7 mEq/L.
* Medications: The patient is receiving amiodarone, heparin, and furosemide (Lasix).
* Assessment and plan: The patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and infection. He will continue to receive amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm, and blood cultures will be obtained. The patient will also receive antibiotics if necessary, and small fluid boluses will be given as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response puts him at risk for further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure and recent episode of hypotension puts him at risk for further episodes of heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's erythematous left lower extremity and history of atrial fibrillation put him at risk for infection.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and treatment with amiodarone puts him at risk for further episodes of hypothyroidism.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's history of hyperkalemia and treatment with amiodarone puts him at risk for further episodes of hyperkalemia.
6. Anemia: The patient's history of anemia and recent blood transfusions puts him at risk for further episodes of anemia.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's history of elevated INR and treatment with anticoagulation puts him at risk for further episodes of elevated INR.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and rate related left
   bundle.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for rhythm.  S/p
   attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol and ace-I for now
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with intermittent pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue home digoxin
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Now
   putting out urine to lasix; Cr rising.
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension and rising
   Cr
   - daily weights and strict I&Os - lasix PRN
   - continue home Simvastatin
   - continue home Midodrine, Digoxin for inotropic support
   - Hold Spiranolactone in the setting of hypotension
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior.
   - Cycle enzymes today - may be elevated secondary to DC/CV
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol.
   - Recheck K
   - Administer kayexalate
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine
   .
   # LLE Erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection.  If
   the patient has an elevated temp or drops pressure again will consider
   starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.
   - wound care
   .
   # Insomnia: stable
   - continue home Ativan PRN and Ambien
   .
   # Depression: stable. per pt, was switched to half-dose because he was
   dc'd on it completely upon last hospital discharge. so, psychiatrist
   started half dose to taper it.
   - continue buproprion 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - sw c/s for med noncompliance
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 36 today, at baseline.
   - continue to monitor
   - consider Fe studies
   .
   # Elev INR: unclear etiology (perhaps [**1-1**] to hepatic congestion from
   heart failure), off anticoagulation bc of h/o GIB
   - continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension. He had a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was transferred to the ICU for further management. He was found to have an unstable rhythm with rapid ventricular response and rate-related left bundle branch block, which was treated with external DC/CV and amiodarone. He also had a left lower extremity erythematous rash and a right heel ulcer, which may be related to an infectious process.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infectious process: The patient's left lower extremity erythematous rash and right heel ulcer may be related to an infectious process, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib and VT, combined with his current unstable rhythm, may lead to further cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to his cardiac arrhythmias, and further management is needed to address this issue.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output may indicate AKI, which could lead to further complications.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be related to his cardiac arrhythmias and poor perfusion state, and further management is needed to address this issue.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may be exacerbated by amiodarone toxicity, and further monitoring is needed to ensure that his thyroid function is within normal limits.
7. Insomnia and depression: The patient's insomnia and depression may be related to his underlying medical condition, and further management is needed to address these issues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication as needed to maintain sinus rhythm.
2. Administer antibiotics if the patient's infectious process is confirmed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, and adjust his medication as needed to prevent hyperkalemia.
6. Restart the patient's thyroid medication and monitor his thyroid function to ensure that it is within normal limits.
7. Continue to manage the patient's insomnia and depression with medication and therapy as needed."

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old male, was transferred to the CCU for hypotension in the setting of ventricular tachycardia (VT). He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiac arrest. The patient was treated with internal and external defibrillation, and his rhythm has been stabilized with amiodarone. He has a history of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and VT, and has had several episodes of VT and Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 132/91 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. He is oxygenating well, with an SpO2 of 100%. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, and his electrolytes are stable, except for a slight elevation in potassium.

The patient has been extubated and is now breathing spontaneously. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and his ejection fraction (EF) is 20%. He has been treated with lasix, and his urine output has been significant. His creatinine (Cr) level is rising, and he is at risk for acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and is currently taking levothyroxine. He has a history of insomnia and depression, and is taking medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is rising, and he is at risk for ARF due to his history of chronic heart failure and hypotension.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of erythematous left lower extremity and a possible site of infection. He is at risk for sepsis and septic shock.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of VT and Afib, and is at risk for cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac conditions.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a history of hypokalemia and is at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to his underlying cardiac conditions and medications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is at risk for hypothyroidism due to his underlying thyroid condition.
7. Insomnia: The patient has a history of insomnia and is at risk for sleep disturbances due to his underlying medical conditions.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is at risk for depressive episodes due to his underlying medical conditions.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
2. Continue to treat the patient's underlying cardiac conditions, including his history of VT and Afib.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine level to assess for ARF.
4. Continue to treat the patient's underlying medical conditions, including his history of COPD and hypothyroidism.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels to assess for electrolyte imbalance.
6. Consider starting low-dose ACE-I to help manage the patient's blood pressure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's sleep patterns to assess for insomnia.
8. Consider starting Vanc for MRSA coverage if the patient's erythematous left lower extremity worsens or if he develops a fever."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%). He was admitted to the CCU for hypotension in the setting of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has a known history of CAD, anterior myocardial infarction (MI), and 5-vessel CABG in 2144.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
* Respiratory support: nasal cannula with oxygen delivery device.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous catheter, arterial line, and Swan-Ganz catheter.
* Fluid balance: 904 mL of fluid has been infused, with a total output of 3,645 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,741 mL.
* Blood products: 3,645 mL of blood has been transfused, with a total output of 415 mL.
* Urine output: 3,645 mL, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.
* NG tube: in place.
* Stool: soft and brown.
* Drains: none.
* Balance: -2,741 mL.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): white blood cell count of 11.0, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 301 K/uL.
* Blood chemistry: sodium of 133 mg/dL, potassium of 1.9 mg/dL, and creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL.
* Troponin-T: 0.08 ng/mL.
* Lactic acid: 3.6 mmol/L.
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL.
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL.
* Phosphorus: 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Hypotension: likely related to unstable rhythm of wide-complex tachycardia, namely VT. The patient was successfully resuscitated with external DC/CV and restoration of sinus rhythm.
* Rhythm: the patient is now in sinus rhythm with pacing.
* Pump: the patient has an EF of 20% on echo, likely ischemic cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI. The patient was being treated for decompensated failure on the [Hospital1] service with lasix. The patient is now putting out significant urine to lasix, with a rising creatinine level.
* Coronaries: the patient has a known history of CAD, s/p 5-vessel CABG in 2144, and anterior MI in 2144. This episode is unlikely to be an acute MI given no chest pain prior.
* Hyperkalemia: likely secondary to poor perfusion state. The patient was administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb, and kayexelate, and corrected today.
* Hypothyroidism: likely secondary to amiodarone toxicity. The patient was restarted on amiodarone emergently, and will decide when to stop and restart sotalol.
* LLE erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection. If the patient has an elevated temperature or drops pressure again, consideration will be given to starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.
* Insomnia: stable. The patient is being continued on home Ativan PRN and Ambien.
* Depression: stable. The patient is being continued on half-dose buproprion, and sw c/s for med noncompliance.
* Anemia: Hct 36 today, at baseline. The patient will continue to be monitored, and consideration will be given to Fe studies.
* Elev INR: unclear etiology, possibly related to hepatic congestion from heart failure. The patient is off anticoagulation due to h/o GIB.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient has a history of VT and is currently being treated with amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm.
* Heart failure: the patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and is currently being treated with lasix and other medications to manage his condition.
* Renal failure: the patient has a rising creatinine level and is at risk for acute renal failure.
* Infection: the patient has erythematous lesions on his left lower extremity and right heel, which could be indicative of a site of infection.
* Hypothyroidism: the patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently being treated with amiodarone, which can exacerbate hypothyroidism.
* Anemia: the patient has a low hemoglobin level and is at risk for anemia.
* Elevated INR: the patient has an elevated INR, which could be related to hepatic congestion from heart failure or other causes.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to treat the patient's heart failure with lasix and other medications.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as necessary.
* Consider starting low-dose ACE-I as cardiologist first.
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider Fe studies.
* Continue to monitor the patient's elevated INR and adjust his anticoagulation status as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%). He was admitted to the CCU for hypotension and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's rhythm is currently stable, with an EF of 20% on echo, likely ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is being treated for decompensated heart failure with lasix, and his creatinine (Cr) is rising. The patient has a history of anterior MI in 95 and was being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr is rising, and he is producing significant urine with lasix. This may indicate ARF, which could worsen his overall condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and he may require further treatment to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Infection: The patient has erythematous lesions on his left lower extremity, which may indicate an infection. This could lead to sepsis and worsen his overall condition.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be secondary to poor perfusion or other underlying conditions. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may be exacerbated by amiodarone toxicity. This could lead to symptoms such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as angina or MI.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be exacerbated by his underlying heart failure and other conditions, which could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
8. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be due to hepatic congestion from heart failure or other underlying conditions. This could lead to bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's Cr levels closely and consider adjusting his diuretic regimen to prevent further worsening of ARF.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting his antihypertensive medications as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's potassium levels closely and consider adjusting his potassium supplements as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and consider adjusting his thyroid medication as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing blood products as needed.
6. Consider starting low-dose ACE-I to help manage the patient's blood pressure and cardiac function.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adjusting his medications as needed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-inch tall male, weighing 113.3 kg, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of chronic systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone 400mg daily, and digoxin was discontinued due to renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/64 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and is on a heparin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to the underlying condition, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased mortality.
2. Sepsis: The patient's acute renal failure and respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to increased fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and death.
5. Skin Integrity Compromise: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to increased risk of infection, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's acute renal failure and respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing thrombosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's pre-existing hypothyroidism may worsen due to the underlying condition, leading to decreased thyroid hormone levels and potential cardiovascular complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm closely to detect any changes in cardiac function.
2. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory support to prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly to prevent further fluid overload.
4. Consider antibiotic therapy to prevent sepsis and treat any potential infections.
5. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and take measures to prevent further compromise.
6. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis.
7. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and consider adjusting thyroid hormone replacement therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension in the
   setting of VT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of wide-complex
   tachycardia, namely VT.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for
   rhythm (EP changed pacer settings yesterday based upon this concern).
   S/p attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity. Now patient
s hypotension significantly improved s/p
   extubation.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol, digoxin and ace-I for now d/t
   hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - d/c digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Now
   putting out significant urine to lasix; Cr rising.
   - goal I
s & O
s: >1L out today; use lasix gtt to titrate to this goal
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension and rising
   Cr
   - daily weights and strict I&Os
   - continue home Simvastatin, midodrine, spinolocatone
   - d/c digoxin d/t renal failure
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I; as cardiologist first
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior. Cardiac enzymes peaked and now
   downtrending.
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol, and kayexelate. Corrected today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine
   .
   # LLE Erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection.  If
   the patient has an elevated temp or drops pressure again will consider
   starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.
   - wound care
   .
   # Insomnia: stable
   - continue home Ativan PRN and Ambien
   .
   # Depression: stable. per pt, was switched to half-dose because he was
   dc'd on it completely upon last hospital discharge. so, psychiatrist
   started half dose to taper it.
   - continue buproprion 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - sw c/s for med noncompliance
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 36 today, at baseline.
   - continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
   systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and
   atrial fibrillation transferred to the CCU for hypotension in the
   setting of VT.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely related to unstable rhythm of wide-complex
   tachycardia, namely VT.  Unclear why internal ICD did not fire for
   rhythm (EP changed pacer settings yesterday based upon this concern).
   S/p attempted internal and successful external DC/CV with resolution of
   hypotension and restoration of sinus rhythm intermittently paced.
   Concerning for infectious process as well given erythematous left lower
   extremity. Now patient
s hypotension significantly improved s/p
   extubation.
   - Attempt to maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone
   - Blood cultures
   - Antibiotics if spikes
   - Hold spironolactone, sotalol, digoxin and ace-I for now d/t
   hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of Afib, h/o VT, now with several
   episodes of VT and Afib with RVR s/p external dc/cv. Pt now in sinus
   rhythm with pacing.
   - Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - Continue amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm
   - Will hold sotalol for now, may decide to restart and stop amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   - d/c digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - f/u EP recs
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has an EF of 20% on echo in [**12-8**], likely ischemic
   cardiomyopathy in the setting of anterior MI in 95.  The patient was
   being treated for decompensated failure on the [**Hospital1 2259**] service with
   lasix.  CXR on admission to CCU shows mild volume overload.  Now
   putting out significant urine to lasix; Cr rising.
   - goal I
s & O
s: >1L out today; use lasix gtt to titrate to this goal
   - monitor UOP, concern for ARF in the setting of hypotension and rising
   Cr
   - daily weights and strict I&Os
   - continue home Simvastatin, midodrine, spinolocatone
   - d/c digoxin d/t renal failure
   - consider starting low dose ACE-I; as cardiologist first
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a known history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG
   in [**2144**] and anterior MI in [**2144**]. This episode is unlikely to be an
   acute MI given no chest pain prior. Cardiac enzymes peaked and now
   downtrending.
   - Continue aspirin and simvastatin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to poor perfusion state.
   Administered calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, sodium bicarb and
   albuterol, and kayexelate. Corrected today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently no symptoms.
   Restarted amiodarone emergently, will decide when to stop and restart
   sotalol.
   - continue home Levothyroxine
   .
   # LLE Erythema and R heel ulcer: concerning for site of infection.  If
   the patient has an elevated temp or drops pressure again will consider
   starting Vanc for MRSA coverage.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, and CABG, who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has a history of VT, Afib, and recurrent VT, and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's rhythm was unstable, with episodes of VT and Afib, and he was treated with amiodarone and external DC/CV. He was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism, likely secondary to amiodarone toxicity. The patient has a history of kidney disease and was treated with lasix, but was discontinued due to renal failure. He has also been diagnosed with anemia, hyperkalemia, and elevated INR.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT and recurrent VT, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's unstable rhythm and history of VT and Afib make him at high risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and he has been treated with lasix, which may not be effective in managing his fluid status.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be a sign of underlying disease, such as chronic kidney disease or cancer, which can worsen his prognosis.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be a sign of underlying electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and arrest.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be a sign of underlying liver disease or coagulopathy, which can increase his risk of bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including MRSA, which can lead to sepsis and death.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he may be at risk for respiratory failure.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Depression: The patient's depression may be a sign of underlying psychological distress, which can worsen his prognosis and quality of life.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for cardiac arrest, renal failure, anemia, hyperkalemia, elevated INR, infection, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and depression."
