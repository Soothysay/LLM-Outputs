   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 67 F with DM, 2VCAD, CKD, and ischemic CMP (EF (20-25%)
   presenting with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days.
   Hyperglycemia corrected but now being admitted to CCU for hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension - Most likely intravascularly depleted secondary to
   volume loss in the setting of several days of osmotic diuresis from
   hyperglycemia.  Pt without fever or WBC or other evidence of infection
   to indicate Sepsis.  No e/o hemorrhage. Possibly cardiogenic but no ST
   elevations to indicate MI or other inciting event. Pt currently SBP
   90-100 after 750mL of IVF.  Total body overloaded.  O2 sats good
   currently on 2L.  Baseline blood pressures are low 90-100.
   - recheck Hct, coags, send T&S.
   - urine & blood cx
   - will place central line & possibly swan ganz to eval pressures.
   - will obtain cxr
   - goal MAP>60, bolus PRN, will use pressors if needed.
   - hold lisinopril and metoprolol
   - recheck ECHO.

   # Diabetes: pt admitted with hyperglycemia after no insulin for a few
   days. No anion gap this admission.  BS in low 100s currently.
   - glargine at home dose
   - sliding scale
   .
   # Hyponatremia: most likely hypovolemic at this point. improved from
   admission which was most likely even lower secondary to hyperglycemia.
   - will check urine lytes.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: [**12-20**] Ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Will
   carefully monitor volume status and I/Os.
   - hold metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix & spironolactone for hypotension
   .
   # CAD: CAD is not intervenable. no angina or cp
   - continue aspirin 325 and statin.
   .
   # Chronic kidney disease: Cr at baseline of 1.4.  Continue to monitor
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes, 2-vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and hyperglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure of 77/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is receiving phenylephrine, milrinone, and levophed infusions to maintain his blood pressure.

The patient's physical examination is significant for distant heart sounds, decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, and +3 edema to the thigh. His laboratory results show anemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk for further hypotension due to his underlying conditions and medications.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further hyperglycemia due to his diabetes and medications.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage due to his underlying condition and medications.
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient's left ventricular function is impaired, and he is at risk for further cardiac damage due to his underlying condition and medications.
5. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's heart failure is chronic, and he is at risk for further heart failure due to his underlying condition and medications.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and he is at risk for further CAD due to his underlying condition and medications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and he is at risk for further hyponatremia due to his underlying condition and medications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and he is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and medications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Intravenous fluids: The patient will receive intravenous fluids to maintain his blood pressure and prevent dehydration.
2. Medications: The patient will receive medications to manage his blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory status.
3. Blood transfusions: The patient may require blood transfusions to manage his anemia and bleeding risk.
4. Cardiac monitoring: The patient will be monitored closely for cardiac arrhythmias and further cardiac damage.
5. Respiratory support: The patient will receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation if necessary.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes, 2-vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%). He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days. The patient had a PEA arrest this morning and was intubated and started on three pressors. He is currently receiving phenylephrine, milrinone, and levophed. The patient has end-stage heart failure and is not a candidate for a balloon pump or other invasive therapies.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's history of PEA arrest and end-stage heart failure, there is a high risk of further cardiac arrests.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a central line and arterial line, which increases the risk of sepsis.
4. Kidney injury: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is at risk of further kidney injury due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
5. Worsening heart failure: The patient's heart failure is likely to worsen due to the lack of effective therapy and the presence of underlying cardiac disease.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his intubation and the presence of central lines.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to arrhythmias and other cardiac complications.
8. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, due to his underlying cardiac disease and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's condition is likely to cause significant psychological distress for both the patient and his family, particularly given the poor prognosis and the lack of effective therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, 2-vessel coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days. She had a PEA arrest this morning and was resuscitated with CPR and intubation. She is currently on three pressors and has end-stage heart failure. The patient's condition is deemed hopeless, and the team is discussing DNR status with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient has already experienced a PEA arrest and is at risk for another cardiac arrest due to her severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and end-stage heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s on three pressors, which may indicate a high risk of further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has significant fluid overload, which may exacerbate her hypotension and increase her risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which may increase her risk of respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling lines and tubes, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may exacerbate her cardiac arrhythmias and increase her risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to her fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and be prepared for further cardiac arrests.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels to minimize the risk of further hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's pressors to optimize her blood pressure and cardiac output.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and be prepared for further respiratory failure.
5. Implement infection prevention measures, such as sterile dressing changes and antibiotic administration, to minimize the risk of infection.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust her medications as necessary to maintain normal electrolyte levels.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's fluid and electrolyte management and minimize the risk of renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall, 94.4 kg male who was admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (systolic, acute on chronic), and has been experiencing profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm (91-154 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/63 mmHg (70-101/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure: 19 mmHg

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and has been weaned off pressors except for levo. The patient has a profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with high lactate levels, which is being compensated by ventilator settings.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 335 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.58 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 3.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are responding to stimuli and have a sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's history of heart failure and cardiac arrest
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory acidosis and need for invasive ventilation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's high lactate levels and metabolic acidosis
* Renal failure due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's history of diabetes and potential gastrointestinal ulcers
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and need for prophylactic anticoagulation
* Infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing management of their cardiac arrest, heart failure, and diabetes, as well as close monitoring of their laboratory results and vital signs. The patient will require continued invasive ventilation and pressor support, as well as ongoing management of their glycemic control and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. He was admitted to the CCU for hypotension and later suffered a cardiac arrest, requiring invasive ventilation and pressors.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, which is being maintained with phenylephrine and levo.
* Respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results show:
	+ Lactic acid level of 3.6 mmol/L, indicating a profound anion gap metabolic acidosis.
	+ Troponin-T level of 0.58 ng/mL, indicating ongoing myocardial injury.
	+ Electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
* Physical examination reveals:
	+ Intubation and sedation with minimal spontaneous movement.
	+ Decreased breath sounds at the bases of the right lung.
	+ +3 edema in the thigh.
	+ No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and any further decline in lung function could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has ongoing myocardial injury, and any further cardiac events could lead to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's minimal neurologic function increases the risk of further neurological decline or development of new neurological deficits.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's sedation and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient's invasive lines and devices increase the risk of infection, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

The patient's goals of care are unclear, and the family has not been consulted regarding the patient's condition. Further discussion with the family and consideration of a comfort measure order (CMO) may be necessary to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected and that his care is aligned with his goals."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage heart failure. The patient presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was admitted to the CCU for hypotension. The patient had a cardiac arrest this morning, requiring invasive ventilation and pressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 84/63 mmHg, with a heart rate of 108 bpm and a respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%.
* Cardiac status: The patient has end-stage heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's troponin T level is 0.58 ng/mL, and his lactate level is 3.6 mmol/L. His creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 20 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's end-stage heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac rupture.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to his end-stage heart failure and respiratory acidosis. The risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory failure, is high.
3. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury (AKI) increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or chronic kidney disease progression.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's decreased level of consciousness and decreased neurological function increase the risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection (UTI).

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue invasive ventilation and pressors to maintain blood pressure and oxygenation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   heart failure. Balloon pump not an option as the patient cannot be
   bridged to other therapy. CAD is not intervenable.
   - maintain MAPS > 60 and wean levo as tolerated
   - hold sedation, fentanyl, versed and monitor mental status
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - family discussion regarding level of care and possible CMO. Pt son
   was coming overnight, but did not come. Will need to discuss with
   family regarding goals of care.
   - no planned escalation of care

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage heart failure. The patient presented with hyperglycemia after missing insulin for several days and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension.

The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, requiring invasive ventilation and multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%. The patient's kidney function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, indicating minimal neurologic function. The patient has 3+ peripheral edema and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for fluid management.

The patient's electrolytes are replete, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is being administered to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's lines include an 18-gauge peripheral IV, an arterial line, and a multi-lumen central venous catheter.

The patient's code status is do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI). The patient's family has been informed of the poor prognosis and has requested DNR status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further cardiac arrest: Given the patient's compromised cardiac function and history of cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of further cardiac events.
2. Worsening renal function: The patient's kidney function is already impaired, and further deterioration could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his compromised immune function and the presence of central lines.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are replete, but further imbalance could occur due to ongoing medical therapy or other factors.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his compromised immune function and the presence of central lines.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his status and manage his care accordingly to prevent further complications."
