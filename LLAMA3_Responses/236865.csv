   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: today
s echocardiogram shows ?
   residual clot in pericardial space with minimal free flowing fluid;
   ventricular function is normal and valves look fine;  I am somewhat
   concerned about the possibility of an effusive constrictive evolution
   of this pericardial problem, and she will need serial echocardiographic
   monitoring post discharge
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, stent, and recent myocardial bridge complicated by bleeding. She presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac cath and pericardiocentesis, which resulted in a stable condition overnight. Her vital signs are stable, and she has no complaints of shortness of breath. She has a drain in place, which is draining minimal fluid.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Effusive constrictive pericarditis: The patient's echocardiogram shows residual clot in the pericardial space with minimal free-flowing fluid. The cardiology teaching physician is concerned about the possibility of an effusive constrictive evolution of this pericardial problem, and the patient will need serial echocardiographic monitoring post-discharge.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has mild wheezing on exam, which may be related to fluid overload. A CXR is pending, and the patient will be given Lasix 20 mg IV x 1.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory wheezing may worsen if not managed properly. She will be given ipratropium nebs to help alleviate the wheezing.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of PAFib and stent. She will need to continue her anticoagulation therapy with Plavix 75 mg po daily.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications. She will need to be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding, and if bleeding occurs, she may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but she will need to be closely monitored for any signs of complications. She will need to continue her anticoagulation therapy and be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding. She will also need to be monitored for any signs of respiratory complications, such as worsening wheezing."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up serial pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA desensitation vs. Plavix [**Hospital1 7**] for stent
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 418 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL.

The patient's pericardial fluid analysis shows a total protein level of 5.6 g/dL, glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase level of 839 U/L. Her white blood cell count in the pericardial fluid is 1833 cells/mL, with a differential count showing 61% polymorphonuclear cells, 31% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Follow-up serial pulsus for evidence of tamponade
* Flush drain with 5cc of normal saline every 8 hours
* Repeat echocardiogram today
* Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0
* Continue to monitor on telemetry
* If bleeding occurs, may need another stent and/or urgent cardiac surgery
* Follow-up hemoglobin level at 2 pm to ensure stability

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding or tamponade
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Fluid overload
* Pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia
* Infection, such as pericarditis or sepsis
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her management plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She has a history of pulmonary embolism and myocardial bridge with stent placement 2 weeks ago, complicated by bleeding and balloon tamponade.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg. She has a mild diffuse wheezing on lung examination, and her pericardial drain is putting out minimal serosanguinous fluid.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 10.2 K/uL
* Hct: 29.5%
* Plt: 418 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 135 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 21.8/36.5/2.0, ALT/AST: 36/30, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's pericardial fluid analysis shows:

* TotProt: 5.6
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* LD(LDH): 839
* Albumin: 3.2

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Follow-up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
* Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6 hours, pull drain
* Repeat echocardiogram today
* Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is 1, may not need coumadin at this time
* Continue to monitor on telemetry
* If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
* F/u Hct at 2 pm to make sure stable

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac tamponade recurrence
* Pericardial effusion reaccumulation
* Bleeding complications
* Fluid overload
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability

The patient's plan includes close monitoring, repeat echocardiogram, and holding coumadin to manage her bleeding risk. Further therapy will depend on the patient's response to treatment and the outcome of her echocardiogram."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Follow-up serial pulsus for evidence of tamponade
* Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours
* Repeat echocardiogram today
* Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0
* Continue to monitor on telemetry
* If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Tamponade physiology due to pericardial fluid accumulation
* Bleeding complications due to coumadin therapy and recent stent placement
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to rate control with diltiazem
* Pericardial fluid re-accumulation despite drainage
* Infection due to pericardial fluid contamination
* Cardiac failure due to underlying myocardial bridge and stent placement

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and pericardial fluid drainage to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion. Possibly due to overhydration
   -          Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   -          FU Chest Xray this morning. Plan for lateral and decub CXR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient, a 73-year-old woman, is being treated in the ICU for a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. The patient has a history of PAFib, coumadin, and a recent myocardial bridge with stent placement. She presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a pulsus of 6, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 102/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3L nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased air movement at the bases bilaterally, increased on the left, with no wheezing or rales/rhonchi. Her cardiac examination shows a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 418. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a slight elevation in potassium and magnesium.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CXR and ECHO, show a large pleural effusion on the left and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Pericardial effusion: Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade, hold coumadin at this time, and continue to monitor on telemetry.
2. Rhythm: Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily, digoxin as part of her home regimen, and hold coumadin given bleeding.
3. Respiratory: Continue oxygen and wean as tolerated, and follow up with a chest X-ray this morning.
4. Pump: Continue to monitor for volume overload in the setting of tamponade.
5. CAD: Continue Plavix 75 mg po daily and ASA 81mg po daily.
6. Dyslipidemia: Continue home dose of pravastatin.
7. ICU care: Continue cardiac/heart healthy diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory symptoms and the presence of a large pleural effusion, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and the continued use of anticoagulants pose a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology may worsen, leading to cardiac tamponade.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory symptoms and the presence of a large pleural effusion may lead to respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's pericardial drain and the presence of a large pleural effusion may increase the risk of infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her medical plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her overall well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion.
   -          Continue O2 and wean as tolerated

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, coumadin, and recent myocardial bridge with stent placement, who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and now has a drain in place, draining minimal fluid overnight.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a pulsus of 6 and no signs of tamponade. She is on telemetry monitoring and has a cardiac rhythm of sinus rhythm. Her respiratory status is improved, with decreased wheezing and improved oxygen saturation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Tamponade recurrence: The patient's pericardial effusion is still present, and there is a risk of tamponade recurrence if the fluid accumulation continues or worsens.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of PAFib and recent stent placement make her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's large left-sided pleural effusion may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
4. Bleeding: The patient's recent bleeding episode and ongoing anticoagulation therapy make her at risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's pericardial drain and pleural effusion increase her risk of developing an infection.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac condition and volume overload may lead to cardiac failure if not managed properly.

In terms of medical management, the patient is currently on a variety of medications, including diltiazem, digoxin, and aspirin, and is receiving cardiac monitoring and respiratory support. The patient's INR is trending down at 1.5, and her CHADS2 score is 1, which may indicate that she may not need coumadin at this time. Further management will depend on the patient's response to treatment and any changes in her condition."

   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.

   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: She is in and out of atrial fib.  I
   am concerned about the possibility of constriction.  She has a fairly
   sizable burden of residual clot in the pericardial space, and she has a
   Kussmaul sign.  Her large left pleural effusion is also of concern.  I
   am hoping that this is due simply to aggressive volume loading.
   However, it is necessary to follow this effusion to its spontaneous
   resolution, or else diagnose and treat it.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   11:02 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 73-year-old woman, was admitted with a large pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and a pericardial drain was placed. The patient's condition has improved, with the drain draining minimal fluid overnight and pulsus stable at 6 this morning. The patient is currently on telemetry and is being monitored for signs of tamponade.

The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, and she is being treated with diltiazem 120 SR daily and digoxin as part of her home regimen. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was previously on coumadin, but it was stopped due to bleeding.

The patient has a large left pleural effusion, which is thought to be due to overhydration. She is being treated with lasix 20mg IV and is on oxygen therapy at 3L NC.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and platelet counts, but elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show a large pleural effusion on chest x-ray and a trivial pericardial effusion on echocardiogram.

The patient's plan includes daily monitoring for signs of tamponade, holding coumadin at this time, and continuing to monitor on telemetry. If the patient bleeds, she may require another stent and/or urgent CT surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tamponade physiology: The patient's large pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology put her at risk for cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest if left untreated.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient's large pleural effusion can cause respiratory compromise, particularly if it is not treated promptly.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and the need to hold coumadin at this time put her at risk for further bleeding complications.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the need to continue diltiazem and digoxin put her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's pericardial drain and pleural effusion put her at risk for infection, particularly if the drain becomes contaminated or if the effusion is not treated promptly.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure her safe and effective treatment."
