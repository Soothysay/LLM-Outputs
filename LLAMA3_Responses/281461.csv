You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and sedated in the ICU. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure ranging from 70/48 to 108/81 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's weight has decreased from 32.3 kg at admission to 29.3 kg currently.

Fluid balance is a concern, with a total intake of 3,597 mL and a total output of 2,620 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 977 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 300 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 264 mL. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 107 K/uL. Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is a concern, and further evaluation of the patient's respiratory function is necessary to determine the optimal level of support.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance may lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but further evaluation of the patient's infection status is necessary to determine the optimal treatment plan.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis is a concern, and further evaluation of the patient's gastrointestinal function is necessary to determine the optimal level of prophylaxis.
5. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism, and further evaluation of the patient's risk factors is necessary to determine the optimal level of prophylaxis.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is a concern, and further evaluation of the patient's nutritional status is necessary to determine the optimal level of nutrition.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but further evaluation of the patient's glycemic control is necessary to determine the optimal level of insulin therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps.  On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient.
   Patient transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
   FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / NPO given bowel edema but

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the 24-hour events and progress note, the patient is a 3-year-old child with a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, cerebral palsy, and chronic intermittent diarrhea. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, fever, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 71 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 70/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 100%
* CVP: 14 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.0 g/dL

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Abdominal pain due to a suspected chronic process, possibly related to chronic pancreatitis
* Respiratory failure due to HAP/VAP
* Fever, possibly due to infection or ischemia
* Hypotension, possibly due to vagal tone, infectious process, or medication reaction
* SMV occlusion, requiring anticoagulation therapy
* Anemia, possibly due to chronic disease, anticoagulation, or dilutional component
* Renal insufficiency, possibly due to hypovolemia, infection, or medication reaction
* Thrombocytopenia, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Coagulopathy, possibly due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease
* Hypoalbuminemia, possibly due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease
* Cerebral palsy, with a history of chronic, intermittent diarrhea and chronic pancreatitis

    Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

    Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps.  On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient.
   Patient transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. **Bowel Ischemia/ Congestion**: The patient has diffuse bowel edema, which is concerning for bowel ischemia or congestion. This can lead to translocation of bacteria, sepsis, and organ failure.
2. **HAP/VAP**: The patient is being treated for HAP/VAP with Vanc, Zosyn, and Tobramycin. The continued presence of LLL infiltrate on CXR and heavy secretions may indicate a persistent respiratory infection.
3. **Fever**: The patient has intermittent fever since admission, which could be due to various causes, including infection, ischemia, or other underlying conditions.
4. **Hypotension**: The patient's baseline BP is in the 70s-80s, and they have become newly bradycardic and hypotensive overnight. This could be due to vagal tone with ET/CVL or an infectious process.
5. **SMV Occlusion**: The patient has a SMV occlusion with a plan for 6 months of anticoagulation. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. **Anemia**: The patient's anemia is unclear in origin, but it may be due to anticoagulation, bowel wall edema, or other underlying conditions.
7. **Renal Insufficiency**: The patient's Cr has increased to 0.7, which could be due to hypovolemia, infection, or medication reaction with AIN.
8. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient has new thrombocytopenia, which could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or other medications.
9. **Coagulopathy**: The patient has a coagulopathy, which could be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease.
10. **Hypoalbuminemia**: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which could be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or underlying conditions.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications from worsening."

    Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.0 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
     - Trial pressure support today and ? extubation
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy, initially admitted for concern of abdominal infection and now reintubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, chronic diarrhea, and malnutrition.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.0, which is an increase from the baseline level of 0.3-0.4. This is likely multifactorial, with series of renal insults including hypovolemia, infection, and medications.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient has a finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals, indicating a chronic process. The patient is at high risk for translocation of bacteria due to compromised bowel wall.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated for HAP/VAP with Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin. The patient has a persistent LLL infiltrate on CXR, but no appreciable changes in ventilator settings.
4. Fever: The patient has intermittent fever since admission, which could be due to ischemia, pulmonary infection, or other sources of infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient has been newly bradycardic and hypotensive overnight, which could be due to vagal tone with ET/CVL or infectious process.
6. SMV Occlusion: The patient has a SMV occlusion, which is being treated with anticoagulation with Heparin gtt and Coumadin.
7. Anemia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, with an unclear source. The patient is being monitored for stool guaiac and Hct.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new thrombocytopenia, which could be due to new exposure to heparin with HIT or other medications.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is being treated with Lovenox.
10. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is being treated with TF and support nutrition as able.

The patient's medications include:

* Antibiotics: Zosyn, Vanc, and Tobramycin
* Anticoagulation: Heparin gtt and Coumadin
* Pain management: Fentanyl
* Sedation: Pantoprazole
* Seizure management: Dilantin and Phenobarbital
* Nutritional support: TPN and tube feeds

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.4
* Hct: 30.9
* Plt: 107
* Cr: 1.0
* TropT: <0.01

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was initially admitted with concerns of abdominal infection and later reintubated for respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic pancreatitis, and his current condition is complicated by SMV thrombus with collaterals, diffuse bowel edema, and possible bowel ischemia/congestion. He is receiving antibiotics for HAP/VAP and has a high risk of translocation of bacteria due to compromised bowel wall. His laboratory results show renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 1.2, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level of 1.2 indicates worsening renal function, which may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions like uremic syndrome.
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient's SMV thrombus with collaterals and diffuse bowel edema may lead to bowel ischemia/congestion, which can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's reintubation for respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, and potentially life-threatening conditions like respiratory acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrest.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, including petechiae, ecchymoses, and potentially life-threatening conditions like intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including petechiae, ecchymoses, and potentially life-threatening conditions like intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia may lead to edema, ascites, and potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's underlying condition may lead to further complications such as seizures, muscle weakness, and potentially life-threatening conditions like respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued monitoring and management of his various medical conditions, including antibiotics for HAP/VAP, anticoagulation for SMV thrombus, and management of his anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia. He also requires close monitoring of his respiratory status, including frequent assessments of his oxygen saturation and ventilator settings. The patient's family should be educated on his condition and the importance of adhering to his treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 29.3 kg (admission: 32.3 kg) child in the ICU, extubated 24 hours ago and tolerating moderate cough on humidified face mask and nasal cannula. The patient received 2 500 cc NS boluses during the day. The central venous pressure (CVP) remains stable at 10 mmHg. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/62 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula at 70% FiO2, with an SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show stable kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 10.1 K/uL, and the platelet count is 129 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's moderate cough and need for humidified face mask and nasal cannula may indicate ongoing respiratory issues. Close monitoring of respiratory status and potential for reintubation is necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 3,394 mL and a total output of 3,517 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 123 mL. Close monitoring of fluid status and potential for fluid overload is necessary.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and chloride, are within normal limits. However, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of laboratory results and potential for infection is necessary.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 129 K/uL, which is within normal limits. However, close monitoring of platelet count and potential for bleeding is necessary.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's nasogastric tube output is 300 mL, which may indicate ongoing gastrointestinal issues. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal status and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary.
7. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are stable, but close monitoring of cardiovascular status is necessary to prevent potential issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible ATN/AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission,
   likely poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg QD per Pharmacy)
   -  Start on Coumadin 5mg PO tonight
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN and tube feeds
 start weaning TPN once INR starts to
   elevate (would indicate gut absorption)
   - Continue pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - F/U celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible ATN/AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission,
   likely poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra

   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
