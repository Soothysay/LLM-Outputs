   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs for Hct<25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs for Hct<25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens, presenting with acute respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory Distress: The patient has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand, and the differential includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible underlying infection.
* Hypotension: The patient's MAP is currently at 60 with a systolic blood pressure of 80, which is suspected to be in part due to sedation, but other causes must be considered.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but it is suspected to be due to stress of respiratory event versus SVT.
* Reported fevers, leukocytosis: The differential includes secondary to progressive disease versus infectious process, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is suspected to be due to chronic disease and chemotherapy, and 1 unit of PRBCs has been transfused.
* Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: The patient has a history of numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens, and her oncology fellow is following along with the ICU team.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which are suggestive of liver injury, but the elevation is not obstructive.
* Elevated troponin: The patient has elevated troponin, which is suspected to be due to demand with subsequent troponin leak.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema or reaction to paclitaxel
* Cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac failure due to hypotension and tachycardia
* Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, or bacteremia, given the patient's leukocytosis and reported fevers
* Hepatic injury or failure due to elevated liver function tests and suspected low flow state
* Anemia or bleeding due to transfusion of PRBCs and possible demand ischemia
* Metastatic disease progression or recurrence of cancer

The plan of care includes:

* Extubation today, pending clinical improvement
* Holding off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
* Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
* Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of fevers, and elevated lactate
* Repeat ABG after extubation
* Consider repeat echocardiogram if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with IVF today
* Evaluate BP after extubation and follow lactate, urine output, and SvO2 off of her port
* Consider placing an arterial line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's if MAP not at goal."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.

   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with
   IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet

   [**Name2 (NI) 129**] status: Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with progressive recurrent stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory support: on pressure support with satisfactory ABG
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP 60, systolic 80, with suspected hypotension due to sedation
* Tachycardia: resolved, with suspicion of stress-related or sinus tachycardia
* Leukocytosis: with differential suggestive of infectious process
* Fevers: reported, with pending blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Anemia: with elevated lactate, tachycardia, and borderline blood pressure, with suspicion of chronic disease and chemotherapy
* Elevated LFTs: suggestive of liver injury, with possible low flow state and hepatic injury
* Elevated troponin: with suspicion of demand-induced troponin leak

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: due to underlying pleural effusions, flash pulmonary edema, or reaction to paclitaxel
2. Sepsis: due to indwelling port, frequent healthcare visits, and reported fevers
3. Anaphylaxis: although less likely, given lack of vasodilatory response
4. Cardiac arrhythmia: given tachycardia and borderline blood pressure
5. Liver failure: due to known liver metastases and elevated LFTs
6. Infection: pending results of blood, urine, and sputum cultures
7. Bleeding: due to anemia and borderline blood pressure
8. Thrombosis: due to indwelling port and chemotherapy

The patient's plan includes:

* Extubation today
* Holding off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
* Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
* Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of fevers, and elevated lactate
* Repeat ABG after extubation
* Consider repeat echocardiogram if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with IVF today."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient has a pleural effusion, which was drained on 09/21/2114 at 11:58 PM, resulting in the removal of 1.3L of fluid. The patient's blood pressure was in the low 80s after the procedure, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of around 65, but no intervention was necessary.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/70 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 242, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 96.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.5 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 401 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of cancer, specifically a gynecological malignancy, and is currently undergoing treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Empyema: The patient's pleural effusion has been drained, but there is a risk of recurrent empyema or development of a secondary infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is ongoing, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, which may indicate an underlying infection.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lactate level is slightly elevated, which may indicate an underlying metabolic disorder or electrolyte imbalance.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer is currently being treated, but there is a risk of disease progression or recurrence.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Continue pressure support ventilation overnight, weaning Fi02 and
   PEEP as tolerated.
   - Lighten her current minimal sedation for SBT and RSB in AM for
   possible extubation
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP, sending BNP
   - Trending cardiac enzymes
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Likely thoracentesis for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (given
   leukocytosis, question of pulmonary infection given cough, fevers),
   either tonight or possibly post-extubation
   - Repeat ABG now
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Infectious work up as noted below.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Would consider stress dose steroids, though does not appear that she
   has been on continuous steroids
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - PRBCs for now in lieu of IVF to help expand intravascular space for
   goal MAP >65. If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus
   pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs as discussed
   below
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures if possible.
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above;
   will need to determine further details of PCN allergy. Vancomycin for
   now given indwelling port and frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   .
   #) FEN: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI (on at home and for while
   intubated)
   .
   #) Access: Right-sided chest port, right groin triple lumen placed in
   ED, one peripheral line
   .
   #) Code:  Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   .
   #) Communication: [**Name (NI) **] father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8080**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens, who presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on pressure support ventilation, with satisfactory ABG. She has underlying pleural effusions, which may have contributed to her acute respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or underlying infection.
* Cardiovascular: She has hypotension, with a MAP of 60, which may be due to sedation, but other causes should be considered. She has a history of tachycardia, which has resolved.
* Hemodynamic: She has leukocytosis, which may be secondary to progressive disease or an infectious process. The differential diagnosis includes secondary to progressive disease, infectious process, or anaphylaxis.
* Renal: Her creatinine is elevated, but improving.
* Liver: Her LFTs are elevated, suggestive of liver injury, possibly due to low flow state with possible hepatic injury.
* Troponin: Her troponin is elevated, which may be due to demand ischemia with troponin leak.
* Anemia: She has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
* Infection: She has reported fevers, leukocytosis, and a cough, which may be due to an infectious process.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Liver failure
* Anemia
* Infection

The plan is to continue pressure support ventilation, wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated, and lighten sedation for SBT and RSB in the morning for possible extubation. The patient will also receive antibiotics, diuresis if needed, and trending cardiac enzymes. A repeat ABG will be done, and consideration will be given to repeat imaging if the above is unrevealing."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Infectious work up as noted below.
   - Would consider stress dose steroids, though does not appear that she
   has been on continuous steroids
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - PRBCs for now in lieu of IVF to help expand intravascular space for
   goal MAP >65. If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus
   pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs as discussed
   below
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures if possible.
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above;
   will need to determine further details of PCN allergy. Vancomycin for
   now given indwelling port and frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   .
   #) FEN: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI (on at home and for while
   intubated)
   .
   #) Access: Right-sided chest port, right groin triple lumen placed in
   ED, one peripheral line
   .
   #) Code:  Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Infectious work up as noted below.
   - Would consider stress dose steroids, though does not appear that she
   has been on continuous steroids
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - PRBCs for now in lieu of IVF to help expand intravascular space for
   goal MAP >65. If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus
   pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs as discussed
   below
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures if possible.
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above;
   will need to determine further details of PCN allergy. Vancomycin for
   now given indwelling port and frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   .
   #) FEN: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI (on at home and for while
   intubated)
   .
   #) Access: Right-sided chest port, right groin triple lumen placed in
   ED, one peripheral line
   .
   #) Code:  Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   .
   #) Communication: [**Name (NI) **] father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8080**]

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, a 47-year-old female, is a stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer patient who has undergone optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel, which may be related to flash pulmonary edema, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or underlying infection. The patient's respiratory distress is being managed with pressure support, and her ABG results are satisfactory.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is being treated with PRBCs and diuresis. Her tachycardia has resolved, and her reported fevers and leukocytosis are being investigated with blood, urine, and sputum cultures. Anemia is suspected due to chronic disease and chemotherapy, and the patient has been transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to liver injury or low flow state. Her troponin levels are elevated, but CK remains flat, suggesting a possible troponin leak due to demand ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potential lung damage.
2. Sepsis: The patient's reported fevers, leukocytosis, and possible infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and increase mortality.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia, elevated troponin levels, and possible demand ischemia may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Liver injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver injury, which can lead to liver failure, coagulopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, which can exacerbate existing conditions and increase mortality.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling port and recent surgery may increase the risk of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and possible coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
8. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and possible liver injury may increase the risk of kidney damage, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

To prevent or mitigate these complications, the patient's care team should continue to monitor her respiratory status, blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory results. They should also maintain a high index of suspicion for infection and bleeding, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG. Pt was extubated successfully yesterday.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on NC. No history of CHF with
   relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in 3/[**2114**].
   - diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - d/c abx given no signs/symptoms of infection and cx NTD
   - consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] at future date.
   .
   #) Hypotension: mostly resolved, SBP in 90-100s now.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.  Now resolved, except for low
   temp this AM (100.2).
   - no abx for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   .
   #) Anemia: Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Onc  following along;
   they reported the family is very involved and communication with
   parents is best via Russian interpreter.
   - follow onc recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Diff icl low flow state with possible hepatic injury; also has known
   liver metaseses.
   - trending down
   - holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - d/c ASA 325 mg daily

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens, presenting with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel.

The patient has undergone extubation successfully and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Her post-extubation ABG shows pH 7.38, pCO2 37, pO2 89, and HCO3 23, indicating a mild respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds with decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, no wheezes, occasional ronchi, and transmitted upper airway noises. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with a cystic ventral lesion.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 20 (increased from 30)
* Hct: 25.6%
* Platelet count: 289 K/uL
* Troponin: 0.48 ng/mL (elevated)
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Trop-T: 0.17 ng/mL (elevated)
* LFTs: Elevated AST, ALT, and LDH
* TCO2: 24
* Glucose: 164 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has underlying pleural effusions, which may have contributed to her acute respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has mostly resolved, but it is still being monitored.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but it is suspected to be due to stress or sinus tachycardia.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is suspected to be due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are suggestive of liver injury, which may be due to liver metastases.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin is elevated, which may be due to demand with subsequent troponin leak.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Diuresis if needed and tolerated by blood pressure.
2. Discontinuation of antibiotics given no signs or symptoms of infection and negative blood and urine cultures.
3. Consideration of repeat imaging at a future date.
4. Continued pain control and maintenance of Hct > 25.
5. Monitoring of blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
6. Follow-up with oncology team and communication with the patient's family via a Russian interpreter.
7. Holding hepatotoxic agents and trending down of elevated LFTs.
8. Discontinuation of ASA 325 mg daily.
9. Transfer to BMT floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to underlying lung disease and pleural effusions.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infection or indwelling port.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to underlying cardiac disease or chemotherapy.
4. Liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy due to liver metastases or liver injury.
5. Anemia or bleeding due to chronic disease, chemotherapy, or liver disease.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to underlying gastrointestinal disease or chemotherapy."

   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with
   IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with
   IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily

Summary:

The patient, a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress. She has undergone optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. The patient was successfully extubated, and her post-extubation ABG showed pH 7.38, pCO2 37, pO2 89, and HCO3 23. Her PM CXR revealed marked volume loss in both lower lungs, which may be due to volume loss or underlying infiltrate. The patient has been advanced to a regular diet, and her WBC has decreased from 30 to 20.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying pleural effusions and poor reserve to tolerate additional demand may lead to further respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, and underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's MAP is currently 60, and her systolic blood pressure is 80. Sedation may be contributing to this, but other causes should be evaluated, such as cardiac arrhythmia or sepsis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to stress or SVT. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to progressive disease or an infectious process. The differential diagnosis includes secondary to chemotherapy, infection, or indwelling port.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease, chemotherapy, or demand ischemia. A transfusion is planned to address this.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs may be due to liver injury, low flow state, or known liver metastases.
7. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin may be due to demand ischemia with subsequent troponin leak.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate, tachycardia, and respiratory distress may indicate sepsis.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's cough, atelectasis, and consolidation on CT may indicate pneumonia.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her indwelling port and immobility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic coverage for possible PNA.
2. Repeat ABG after extubation.
3. Consider repeat CXR if the patient's respiratory distress persists.
4. Monitor blood pressure, lactate, and urine output.
5. Place an arterial line for better monitoring of blood pressure and ABG.
6. Consider IVF or pressors if the patient's blood pressure remains low.
7. Continue pain control and monitor Hct.
8. Follow up with oncology team regarding patient's course and social situation.
9. Monitor liver function tests and trend enzymes.
10. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures."
