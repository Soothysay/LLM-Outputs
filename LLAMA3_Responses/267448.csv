   Changes to medical and family history:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 8791**] is a 25 yo male with severe cerebral palsy, non-verbal at
   baseline who was transferred from [**Hospital3 1492**] where he was being
   evaluated for Left foot swelling and incidentally found to have Hct of
   20. There was concern that his stools were melanotic. He was given 2
   units of PRBC, a PPI and transferred for further evaluation.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: 100.0 110 117/84 18 98%
   ra. He spiked a fever to 102 and had a leukocytosis of 33. He was given
   vancomycin 1 gm x1, Levofloxacin 750mg X1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1 to
   empirically cover both HAP and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 4158**] abdominal process. He was also
   give NS 1L and ativan. For evaluation of his GIB, his NG lavage was
   negative, stool dark & guiaic positive but not obvious melena. His
   abdomen was rigid on exam so general surgery was conulted and a CT of
   the abd/pelvis was performed which showed a large mass in the right
   proximal colon and possilby a partial bowel obstruction. GI felt that
   surgery was not necessary urgently and requested that the patient have
   either a barium enema or a colonoscopy. The mass was noted to be
   obstructing the ureter and causing hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
   Urology was consulted and will see the patient this morning. He will
   likely need percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed by IR. His vital signs
   prior to transfer as as follows: 98.4 110 108/79 20 100% ra.
   .
   In conversation with his caregiver he had a change in behavior
   approximately 3 months ago when his mood seemed to become more labile.
   He was crying frequently and often reporting abdominal pain. He was
   admitted at [**Hospital3 **] and spent 3-4 weeks there. Per [**Hospital1 **] ED notes, he had 2 abd CT scans there without acute change, a
   bone marrow bx w/o myeloproliferative findings and pan cultures were
   persistently negative. The caregiver knows that he required blood
   transfusions but does not know of any diagnosis. He developed diarrhea
   2-3 weeks ago. He has had about a 40lb weight loss over the past few
   months despite a good appetite. He vomited (foodstuff; non-bloody) once
   on the day prior to admission and this is a new symptom for him. He is
   able to sign yes or no when asked questions. He reported pain in his
   right foot and his belly. He has had intermittent fevers for the past
   few weeks.
   .
   Since admission, the patient has been followed by general surgery, GI
   and urology.  The patient was originally put on cipro and flagyl and
   was transitioned to cefepime and flagyl.  An NGT was recommended for
   decompression which the patient had removed 4 times.  Pt was scheduled
   to have colonoscopy on Friday with Gen [**Doctor First Name 3**] on stand-by in case of a
   perforation but it was decided to hold off, continue antibiotics and
   repeat CT scan specifically trying to get contrast in the RLQ and also
   to assess renal issues.  Pt was also to have percutaneous nephrostomy
   tube placement for his right-sided hydronephrosis by IR but is was felt
   that poitioning could be an issues.  Tube placement was deferred unless
   he decompensates though he supposed to get a Mag S study on Monday.  Pt
   was also noted to have an IVC thrombosis for which he was started on a
   heparin drip.  Pt's diet was liberalized and he aspirated Ensure
   pudding this evening.  Pt briefly desatted to 80% on ra but O2 sats
   recovered with suctioning.  Pt tachycardic to the 140s with a
   respiratory rate to 34.  Pt was then transferred to the ICU for further
   management.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   evaluated for Left foot swelling and incidentally found to have Hct of
   20. There was concern that his stools were melanotic. He was given 2
   units of PRBC, a PPI and transferred for further evaluation.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals: 100.0 110 117/84 18 98%
   ra. He spiked a fever to 102 and had a leukocytosis of 33. He was given
   vancomycin 1 gm x1, Levofloxacin 750mg X1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1 to
   empirically cover both HAP and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 4158**] abdominal process. He was also
   give NS 1L and ativan. For evaluation of his GIB, his NG lavage was

   surgery was not necessary urgently and requested that the patient have
   either a barium enema or a colonoscopy. The mass was noted to be
   obstructing the ureter and causing hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
   Urology was consulted and will see the patient this morning. He will
   likely need percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed by IR. His vital signs
   prior to transfer as as follows: 98.4 110 108/79 20 100% ra.
   .
   In conversation with his caregiver he had a change in behavior
   approximately 3 months ago when his mood seemed to become more labile.

   able to sign yes or no when asked questions. He reported pain in his
   right foot and his belly. He has had intermittent fevers for the past
   few weeks.
   .
   Since admission, the patient has been followed by general surgery, GI
   and urology.  The patient was originally put on cipro and flagyl and
   was transitioned to cefepime and flagyl.  An NGT was recommended for
   decompression which the patient had removed 4 times.  Pt was scheduled
   to have colonoscopy on Friday with Gen [**Doctor First Name 3**] on stand-by in case of a

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with severe cerebral palsy, non-verbal at baseline, who was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal mass, fevers, and witnessed aspiration. He has a history of severe gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Tachypnea, tachycardia, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardia with a heart rate of 124 beats per minute.
* Abdominal: Tender, tense, and guarding, with a large mass in the right proximal colon, causing small-bowel obstruction and right-sided hydronephrosis.
* Neurological: Follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has no motor or sensory deficits.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has witnessed aspiration of Ensure pudding and own vomitus, which may lead to pneumonia.
* Small-bowel obstruction: The patient has a large abdominal mass causing small-bowel obstruction, which may lead to bowel perforation and peritonitis.
* Hydronephrosis: The patient has right-sided hydronephrosis, which may lead to kidney damage and sepsis.
* IVC thrombosis: The patient has an IVC thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
* Blastocytosis: The patient has Blastocytosis in his stool, which may lead to diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps.
* Poor nutritional status: The patient has poor nutritional status, which may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue antibiotics to cover for potential infections.
* Monitor stool output and abdominal exam to assess for small-bowel obstruction.
* Continue NGT to suction to prevent aspiration.
* Monitor urine output and renal function to assess for hydronephrosis.
* Continue heparin gtt to treat IVC thrombosis.
* Continue TPN to improve nutritional status.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction.

The patient's disposition is to be transferred back to the floor in the morning if stable from a respiratory standpoint."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, admitted to the ICU with a large abdominal mass, suspected to be either an infected missed appendiceal rupture or a malignancy (lymphoma or sarcoma). He has been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea, and has had a GI bleed, leukocytosis, anemia, and a possible small bowel obstruction. He also has a history of aspiration pneumonia, hydronephrosis, hypernatremia, and an IVC thrombosis. The patient is currently receiving TPN, antibiotics, and other medications, and is being monitored for respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological stability.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's abdominal mass may be infected, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's abdominal mass may be causing a small bowel obstruction, which could lead to bowel perforation, peritonitis, and death.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and death.
5. Hydronephrosis: The patient's hydronephrosis may worsen, leading to renal failure and death.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to seizures, coma, and death.
7. IVC Thrombosis: The patient's IVC thrombosis may worsen, leading to pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and death.
8. Poor Nutritional Status: The patient's poor nutritional status may worsen, leading to malnutrition, weakness, and increased risk of infection.
9. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may worsen, leading to increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological complications.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics to treat infection and sepsis.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
3. Consider surgical intervention to remove the abdominal mass and treat any underlying infections.
4. Monitor for signs of small bowel obstruction, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
5. Continue respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
6. Monitor for signs of hydronephrosis, including flank pain and hematuria.
7. Continue IV fluids to manage hypernatremia and hypovolemia.
8. Monitor for signs of IVC thrombosis, including pain, swelling, and shortness of breath.
9. Continue TPN to manage poor nutritional status.
10. Monitor for signs of cerebral palsy worsening, including increased spasticity and decreased respiratory function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   Assessment and Plan
   25M with cerebral palsy admitted with GI bleed with acute blood loss
   anemia, leukocytosis found to have a large abdominal mass concerning
   for infection (walled off missed appendiceal rupture) v malignancy
   (lymphoma v sarcoma), complicated by right-sided hydronephrosis and an
   IVC thrombosis.
   .
   #.  GI Bleed
 Acutely bleeding.  Likely [**1-22**] intra-tumor hemorrhage
   though has been persistently anemic since presentation to OSH in [**Month (only) 93**]
   of this year.  s/p 3 units pRBCs since presenting to OSH.
   - vitamin K
   - hold heparin gtt
   - serial HCT, stat HCT now
   - Active T&S
   - Transfuse 2 units PRBCs
   - Tele
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - GI and gen [**Doctor First Name **] following

   #. Abdominal Mass - Possible etiologies infection missed appendiceal
   rupture) v malignancy (lymphoma v sarcoma; CEA 4.7, borderline
   elevation). Felt to be a high risk for either surgery or colonoscopy.
   Mass appears larger on reimaging today.  It is important at this point
   to obtain a tissue diagnosis.  GI and general surgery have refused to
   intervene given patient's poor nutritional status.
   - team meeting with GI and gen [**Doctor First Name **] to come up with plan for tissue
   diagnosis.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - NPO
   - Replace NGT if nauseated
   - Monitor stool output
   - Continue TPN in effort to improve nutritional status to optimize
   surgical candidacy
   .
   #. Small Bowel Obstruction - [**1-22**] abdominal mass.  Has been having
   extensive diarrhea.  BMs seemed to have diminished today, and have been
   more consistent with seepage.
   - replace NGT if possible
   - NPO
   - Gen [**Doctor First Name **] following
   - Monitor fecal output
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - KUB if clinically worsens to r/o free air
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia - Pt has witness aspiration this evening.
   Initially aspirated on Ensure pudding and subsequently on own vomitus.
   Lactate 1.8.
   - Continue vanc, cefepime and flagyl.
   - NPO
   - Continue IVFs.
   .
   #.  Hydronephrosis - Likely secondary to large right-sided mass.
   Urology following and has recommended IR-guided percutaneous drain
   placement.  However, Urology felt that it would be best to defer for
   renal decompensation given that he would he a difficult person to put a
   drain into given body habitus.
   - MAG 3 deferred
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - GI losses v fevers v high repiratory rate.  Have to
   way benefits of giving free water aloing with that of giving volume
   given fevers, tachycardia and pneumonitis.  Therefore will continue to
   give D5 1/2NS.  Urine osms consistent with Complete DI.  Could be
   related to poor nutritional status, postobstruction hydronephrosis.
   - Free water deficit ~1.8L
   - Urine osm, urine na

   #.  Leukocytosis - Bone marrow biopsy at [**Hospital3 **] unrevealing.
   Could be ongoing infection.  Pt did also have UTI and blastocytosis
   infections.
   - Continue antibiotics
   - trend
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #.  IVC Thrombosis - Likely secondary to venous stasis from abdominal
   mass.  On Heparin gtt,  IVC now patent with therapy.
   - Holding heparin in setting of GI bleed
   - Remove compressive mass when possible
   .
   #. Blastocytosis in Stool -  Symptoms that have been reported to be
   associated with B. hominis infection include: diarrhea, nausea,
   anorexia, abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence and fatigue. Watery
   diarrhea is usually described. Both acute and chronic diarrhea have
   been reported. Fever is usually absent.  Significance in this patient
   is unclear, should be adequately treated by flagyl.
   - Continue flagyl
   - Continue supportive fluids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was admitted with a gastrointestinal bleed, acute blood loss anemia, and leukocytosis. He was found to have a large abdominal mass, which is concerning for infection or malignancy. The patient has a complex medical history, including a history of missed appendiceal rupture, right-sided hydronephrosis, and an IVC thrombosis.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient is acutely bleeding, and it is likely due to an intra-tumor hemorrhage. He has received 3 units of packed red blood cells since admission and is being treated with vitamin K, holding heparin, and serial hemoglobin checks.
2. Abdominal Mass: The patient has a large abdominal mass that is concerning for infection or malignancy. He has been treated with antibiotics, and a tissue diagnosis is being planned.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has been experiencing extensive diarrhea and has a history of small bowel obstruction. He is being treated with replacement of nasogastric tubes, NPO, and serial abdominal exams.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspirated on Ensure pudding and own vomitus, and has a lactate level of 1.8. He is being treated with antibiotics and NPO.
5. Hydronephrosis: The patient has right-sided hydronephrosis, which is likely secondary to the large abdominal mass. Urology has recommended IR-guided percutaneous drain placement, but has deferred due to renal decompensation.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely due to GI losses, fevers, and high respiratory rate. He is being treated with D5 1/2NS and has a free water deficit of approximately 1.8L.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is being treated with antibiotics and monitored with serial white blood cell counts.
8. IVC Thrombosis: The patient has an IVC thrombosis, which is likely secondary to venous stasis from the abdominal mass. He is being treated with heparin and has a patent IVC.
9. Blastocytosis in Stool: The patient has blastocytosis in his stool, which is being treated with flagyl.

The patient's current medications include:

* Morphine sulfate
* Dilaudid
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Flagyl
* Vitamin K
* Heparin

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 38.7
* Platelet count: 379
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 134 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.4 g/dL
* LDH: 489 IU/L

The patient's plan includes:

* Tissue diagnosis of the abdominal mass
* Further management of the GI bleed
* Management of the small bowel obstruction
* Treatment of the aspiration pneumonia
* Monitoring of the hydronephrosis
* Treatment of the hypernatremia
* Monitoring of the leukocytosis
* Treatment of the IVC thrombosis
* Management of the blastocytosis in stool
* Continued TPN for nutritional support

   Abdominal Mass - Possible etiologies infection  missed appendiceal
   rupture) v malignancy (lymphoma v sarcoma). Felt to be a high risk for
   either surgery or colonoscopy.  Mass appears larger on remiaging
   today.  It is important at this point to obtain a tissue diagnosis.  GI
   and general surgery have refused to intervene given patient's poor
   nutritional status.
   - team meeting with GI and gen [**Doctor First Name **] to come up with plan for tissue
   diagnosis.
   - Continue antibiotics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a large abdominal mass, which may be infected, and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, all of which are indicative of sepsis.
2. Intestinal Obstruction: The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which can lead to further complications such as bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspirated on Ensure pudding and own vomitus, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
5. Hydronephrosis: The patient has right-sided hydronephrosis, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease if left untreated.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, seizures, and coma if not treated promptly.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation.
8. IVC Thrombosis: The patient has IVC thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death if not treated promptly.
9. Poor Nutritional Status: The patient has poor nutritional status, which can lead to malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function.
10. Cerebral Palsy: The patient has cerebral palsy, which can lead to seizures, spasticity, and decreased cognitive function if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's current condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Obtain a tissue diagnosis of the abdominal mass to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
2. Continue antibiotics to treat any underlying infections.
3. Monitor the patient's stool output and abdominal exam to assess for any signs of intestinal obstruction.
4. Replace the NGT if possible to prevent further aspiration.
5. Continue TPN to improve the patient's nutritional status.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat any signs of respiratory failure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and treat any signs of hypernatremia or hypokalemia.
8. Consider imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI to assess for any signs of IVC thrombosis or hydronephrosis.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cognitive function and treat any signs of cerebral palsy.
10. Consider involving a nutritionist to develop a plan for the patient's nutritional needs."

Summary:

The patient is a non-verbal individual admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. Over the past 24 hours, they have experienced significant bleeding, requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells and vitamin K administration. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 145 bpm, blood pressure of 105/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 68%. They are receiving hydromorphone and lorazepam infusions for pain and anxiety management. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating potential sepsis. The patient's condition is deemed comfort care, with a code status of ""comfort measures only.""

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels suggest potential sepsis. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction, failure, and death if left untreated.
2. Bleeding: The patient's significant bleeding and requirement for blood transfusions indicate a high risk of further bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic shock and organ damage.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 68% and lack of respiratory support suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac compromise, which can lead to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure if left untreated.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated lactate levels and potential sepsis may indicate a risk of renal failure, which can further complicate the patient's condition.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and bleeding may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal perforation, obstruction, or bleeding, which can lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a non-verbal individual who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. Over the past 24 hours, they have been experiencing copious bright red blood per rectum, requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and vitamin K administration. The patient's family has been informed of their condition, and a comfort care plan has been initiated. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 145 bpm, blood pressure of 105/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 68%. They are receiving hydromorphone and lorazepam infusions for pain and anxiety management. The patient's laboratory results show a low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: Given the patient's low platelet count and recent bleeding episode, there is a risk of further bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of indwelling lines and drains increase their risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or central line-associated bloodstream infections.
3. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of liver failure, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and abnormal ABG results indicate the possibility of respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by their underlying condition and medical treatments.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding and abdominal pain may be indicative of gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, obstruction, or ischemia.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and potential gastrointestinal complications may lead to nutritional compromise and malnutrition.
8. Psychological distress: The patient's non-verbal state and comfort care plan may lead to psychological distress and emotional suffering for the patient and their family.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to adjust their treatment plan accordingly and provide optimal care."
