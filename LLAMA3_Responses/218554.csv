   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 20.8 so will hold current dose and recheck
   tomorrow
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN:
    - IVF boluses as needed
    - Replete lytes PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia
    - NPO while mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron
   # Access: PIV, Port

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 20.8 so will hold current dose and recheck
   tomorrow
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

   [**Name2 (NI) 66**] status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition: ICU pending improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic hypoventilation, CRI, ARF, DVT, MDS, and IBD. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has a long list of medications and treatments.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis, with an ABG of 7.02/92/26. She is on non-invasive ventilation (NPPV/BiPAP) and is being treated for possible LLL pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis. She has a history of cardiac silhouettes and pulmonary vessels that are difficult to evaluate due to patient motion or breathing.
* Renal: The patient has oliguria and worsening renal function, with a creatinine of 2.8. She is being treated with IVF and is at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Metabolic: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with intermittent respiratory acidosis. She is being treated with hydrocortisone succinate for adrenal insufficiency.
* Hematological: The patient has acute blood loss due to multiple ecchymoses and hematomas. She has received 5 units of PRBC and is being treated with steroids and blood transfusions.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has diarrhea and is being treated with mesalamine and steroids.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status (AMS) and is being treated with pain management and sedation.
* Wound care: The patient has multiple wounds, including decubitus ulcers, and is being treated with wound care and dressing changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising WBC count are concerning for sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria and worsening renal function put her at risk for acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis put her at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
* Infection: The patient's multiple wounds and history of DVT put her at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid use and current treatment with hydrocortisone succinate put her at risk for adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and death.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Non-invasive ventilation (NPPV/BiPAP) for respiratory failure
* Hydrocortisone succinate for adrenal insufficiency
* IVF and blood transfusions for renal failure and anemia
* Wound care and dressing changes for decubitus ulcers
* Pain management and sedation for altered mental status
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

The patient's prognosis is poor due to her complex medical history and current condition. She is at risk for multiple complications, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, infection, and adrenal insufficiency."

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin (vanco dosed
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN:
    - IVF boluses as needed
    - Replete lytes PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia
    - NPO while mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron
   # Access: PIV, Port

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates

   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension.
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics

   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but

Summary:

The patient is a 83-year-old woman with a history of chronic hypoventilation, CRI, ARF, IBD, DVT, MDS, and chronic steroid use. She was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of ARF and was treated with Lasix and antibiotics. However, her condition worsened, and she developed hypotension, oliguria, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred back to the ICU for management of her progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Cultures are pending, and she is being treated with antibiotics.
2. Oliguria and Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's intermittent and worsening oliguria is a concern, and her creatinine levels are slightly up. She may require further treatment for acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia is a significant concern, and she requires non-invasive ventilation (NPPV) and close monitoring of her VBGs.
4. Fall with Multiple Fractures and Lacerations: The patient's fall and subsequent injuries may have caused bleeding and may require further treatment.
5. Acute on Chronic Anemia: The patient's history of myelodysplastic disorder and acute blood loss may require further treatment, including transfusions and medication.
6. Crohn's Disease: The patient's history of Crohn's disease may require further treatment, including medication and dietary changes.
7. Hx of PE/DVT: The patient's history of PE/DVT may require further treatment, including anticoagulation therapy.
8. Loss of Vision/Cataracts: The patient's loss of vision and cataracts may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may require further treatment, including wound care and pressure relief measures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, urine output, and electrolyte levels closely.
3. Continue non-invasive ventilation (NPPV) and monitor the patient's VBGs.
4. Consider further treatment for acute on chronic renal failure, including dialysis.
5. Monitor the patient's pain levels and adjust her pain medication as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her medication as needed.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's loss of vision and cataracts.
8. Continue wound care and pressure relief measures for the patient's decubitus ulcer."

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficienct).
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q12
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon
   transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today. Per renal,
   somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.   Previous baseline 1.7 - 2.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.
    - Lovenox daily, daily Hct
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   .
   # FEN: IVF while poor PO intake / Replete PRN & monitor for
   hyperkalemia / NPO while mental status poor
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron
   .

   For hypotension - minimal evidence of systemic infection, poor response
   to fluids and limited ability to tolerate more volume - will add
   florinef for mineralocorticoid effect as she is only on dex right now
   and will monitor BP / UOP response. For fall, continue wound / skin
   care, tylenol and low dose morphine for pain. ARF on CRI - may be near
   new baseline, will follow UOP and Cr trend, vanco to level, RD meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficienct).
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q12
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon

    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today. Per renal,
   somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.   Previous baseline 1.7 - 2.

    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.
    - Lovenox daily, daily Hct
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficient).
    - Hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon
   transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
   - Renally dose all medications
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   - Pt w/ persistent acidotic pH
   - Well follow serum lactate
   -monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
   - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today. Per renal,
   somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.   Previous baseline 1.7 - 2.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses as needed / Replete PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia /
   NPO while mental status poor
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron
   .
   # Access: PIV, Port

   Agree with plan to
   For hypotension - minimal evidence of systemic infection, poor response
   to fluids and limited ability to tolerate more volume - will add
   florinef for mineralocorticoid effect as she is only on dex right now
   and will monitor BP / UOP response. For fall, continue wound / skin
   care, tylenol and low dose morphine for pain. ARF on CRI - may be near
   new baseline, will follow UOP and Cr trend, vanco to level, RD meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CXR [**2195-4-7**]:
   In comparison with study of [**4-5**], there is continued enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat difficult to
   evaluate due to patient motion or breathing, but they do not appear to
   be
   appreciably engorged. There is increased opacification at the left base
   most
   likely related to atelectasis and effusion. However, in the absence of
   a
   lateral view, it is impossible to exclude overlying pneumonia.
   Central catheter remains in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension:  Newly the day of transfer to the ICU.  The night prior
   was given Lasix IV x 2 the day prior.  Some concern for hypovolemia
   (but minimal urine output which limits bolusing)   Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Many pending cultures.  She was bolused with NS x 3
   L and treated.  Additionally her steroid burst was decreased the day
   prior from Dexamethasone 4 mg TID to [**Hospital1 **] (she's chronically on steroids
   for her Crohn's disease so most likely adrenally insufficient).
    - Hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - Continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.  Upon
   transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
   - Renally dose all medications
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On last admission to ICU, patient
   with worsened hypercarbia.  Unclear what CO2 level is today, bu pH
   7.09. Poor mask fit on floor with possible contribution of sedating
   meds, possibly Tramadol + morphine dosing for ongoing pain due to femur
   fracture. Other considerations include PE (given history, femur
   fracture and off Lovenox) vs PNA.  CXR today with worsened atelectasis
   vs effusion vs PNA.
   - Pt w/ persistent acidotic pH
   - Well follow serum lactate
   -monitor vbgs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic respiratory
   failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
   - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
    - BiPAP
    - VBG now and post-BiPAP
    - IS as able
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  Currently being treated for HAP; with hypercarbia on
   VBG.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.8 today. Per renal,
   somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.   Previous baseline 1.7 - 2.

   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a PortaCath inserted for chemotherapy, requiring non-invasive ventilation and experiencing hypoxemia, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of allergies, including belladonna alkaloids, itching, and swelling, and has received infusions and other medications. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 81/37 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as elevated creatinine and glucose levels. The patient's mental status is altered, and they have a code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This condition can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 levels are 100%, but the ABG results indicate a pH of 7.19, which may indicate respiratory acidosis. This condition can lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to further complications, such as infection, necrosis, and decreased mobility.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, but the ECG results are not provided. This condition can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which can lead to further complications, such as dehydration, increased risk of infection, and decreased wound healing.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 81/37 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. This condition can lead to further complications, such as decreased organ perfusion, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of infection.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which can lead to further complications, such as decreased cognitive function, increased risk of falls, and decreased ability to communicate.
8. Impaired Tissue Perfusion: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, which may indicate impaired tissue perfusion. This condition can lead to further complications, such as decreased organ function, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of infection.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of acute renal failure, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, pain, dyspnea, cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/37 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation with a bipap mask, with a Vt of 461 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 104 K/μL. The patient's blood chemistry results show a creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL, glucose of 127 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 0.7 mmol/L. 

The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.05, pCO2 of 78 mmHg, pO2 of 59 mmHg, and HCO3 of 23 mmol/L. 

The patient's physical examination shows a soft, mildly distended abdomen, and warm, well-perfused extremities. The patient has multiple skin tears with wound care and a large bandage on the right arm with ecchymosis in the right shoulder. 

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further decline in kidney function.
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation, and there is a risk of aspiration of secretions and development of VAP.
3. Skin infections: The patient has multiple skin tears with wound care, and there is a risk of skin infections.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, and there is a risk of further cardiovascular instability.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, and there is a risk of further hyperglycemia.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is a risk of further hypotension.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.

The patient's ICU care plan includes management of acute renal failure, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, pain, dyspnea, cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation, and further management will depend on the patient's response to treatment and the development of any complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. They have a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, hyperglycemia, and hypotension. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, heparin, and pain management agents. They are being monitored closely for respiratory and cardiovascular stability.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may persist or worsen, potentially leading to respiratory failure, acidosis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity may progress, increasing the risk of infection, tissue necrosis, and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's cardiac dysrhythmia may recur or worsen, potentially leading to cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, or cardiac failure.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may persist or worsen, increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or cardiovascular events.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist or worsen, potentially leading to organ dysfunction, shock, or cardiovascular events.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's altered nutrition may lead to malnutrition, decreased immune function, and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, increasing the risk of falls, medication errors, and prolonged hospitalization.
9. Tissue Perfusion: The patient's altered tissue perfusion may lead to organ dysfunction, tissue necrosis, or delayed wound healing.
10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support may increase the risk of VAP, potentially leading to sepsis, pneumonia, or respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, hypoxemia, impaired skin integrity, pain, and dyspnea. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been bolused for hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 76/27 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and fluid overload.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as infection, sepsis, and organ failure.
4. Pain: The patient's pain may not be adequately managed, leading to further complications, such as delirium, agitation, and increased risk of falls.
5. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
6. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's cardiac dysrhythmia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac arrest and death.
7. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to delirium, agitation, and increased risk of falls.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infections.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to shock, organ failure, and death.
10. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and presence of central venous catheter and urinary catheter may increase the risk of infection, leading to sepsis and organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox

Summary:

The patient is a 83-year-old female with a history of chronic hypoventilation, CRI, ARF, DVT, MDS, and Crohn's disease. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She has multiple comorbidities, including acute on chronic renal failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and acidosis. She has also had multiple falls, leading to fractures and lacerations, and has a history of PE/DVT.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on non-invasive ventilation (NPPV/BiPAP) and has worsening hypercarbia with an ABG of 7.02/92/26.
* Cardiovascular: She has hypotension and is at risk for sepsis.
* Renal: She has acute on chronic renal failure with intermittent and worsening oliguria.
* Hematological: She has a history of myelodysplastic disorder and has received PRBC transfusions.
* Gastrointestinal: She has diarrhea and is on mesalamine for Crohn's disease.
* Neurological: She has AMS and is at risk for further decline due to toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, and hospital delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising WBC count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis may lead to ARDS.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening oliguria and acidosis may lead to AKI.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of PE/DVT and recent falls may lead to bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's history of MDS and recent falls may increase her risk of infection.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid use and recent stress may lead to adrenal insufficiency.
7. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's prolonged bed rest may lead to decubitus ulcer.
8. Cataracts: The patient's history of cataracts and recent vision loss may worsen with continued hospitalization.
9. Pressure Sores: The patient's prolonged bed rest and immobility may lead to pressure sores.

Plan:

1. Continue NPPV/BiPAP for respiratory support.
2. Monitor VBGs and adjust NPPV as needed.
3. Continue antibiotics for possible LLL pneumonia.
4. Monitor lactate levels and adjust hydrocortisone succinate dose as needed.
5. Continue to monitor urine output and adjust IVF as needed.
6. Continue to monitor electrolytes and adjust kayexelate dose as needed.
7. Monitor Hct daily and adjust PPx Bactrim as needed.
8. Continue eye gtts per home regimen.
9. Follow wound care recs for decubitus ulcer.
10. Monitor for bleeding complications and adjust lovenox dose as needed.
11. Monitor for infection and adjust antibiotics as needed.
12. Monitor for adrenal insufficiency and adjust hydrocortisone succinate dose as needed.
13. Monitor for pressure sores and adjust positioning as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended

   Communication:  Patient (Russsian), Emergency Contact: Daughter
   [**Name2 (NI) 66**] status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition: ICU pending improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old female who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and myelodysplastic disorder (MDS).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on non-invasive ventilation (NPPV) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.02, pCO2 of 92 mmHg, and pO2 of 26 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 76/27 mmHg, and is at risk for sepsis. Her lactate levels are elevated at 1.0 mmol/L.
* Renal: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL. She is oliguric, with a urine output of 10-20 mL/hour.
* Metabolic: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with an anion gap of 26.53%.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is currently taking mesalamine and Flagyl (metronidazole).
* Hematological: The patient has a history of MDS and is currently receiving transfusions.
* Wound care: The patient has multiple wounds, including decubitus ulcers, and is being followed by wound care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels suggest that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Wound complications: The patient's multiple wounds may become infected or develop complications, such as decubitus ulcers.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and current medications may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or bleeding.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's history of MDS and current transfusions may increase her risk for hematological complications, such as bleeding or infection.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include:

1. Close monitoring of her respiratory status, including frequent ABG measurements and adjustments to her non-invasive ventilation settings.
2. Management of her hypotension, including the use of vasopressors and fluid boluses as needed.
3. Monitoring of her renal function, including frequent creatinine measurements and adjustments to her fluid management plan.
4. Management of her metabolic acidosis, including the use of bicarbonate supplements and adjustments to her ventilation settings.
5. Wound care, including regular dressing changes and monitoring for signs of infection or wound complications.
6. Gastrointestinal care, including monitoring for signs of diarrhea or bleeding and adjusting her medications as needed.
7. Hematological care, including monitoring for signs of bleeding or infection and adjusting her transfusion plan as needed.

Overall, the patient's care plan should be individualized and tailored to her specific needs and medical history."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Cefepime / Vancomycin
   - Will start Flagyl IV today
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO

   [**Name2 (NI) 66**] status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition: ICU pending improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 83-year-old female with a history of chronic hypoventilation, CRI, and MDS, who was transferred back to the ICU due to progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She has a complex medical history, including recent falls/fractures, IBD, DVT, and MDS. She is currently experiencing hypotension, oliguria, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with intermittent respiratory acidosis. She is also experiencing acute on chronic anemia, and has a history of PE/DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and rising WBC count suggest a high risk of sepsis, particularly given her recent antibiotic use.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and worsening creatinine levels suggest AKI, which may be due to pre-renal or ATN causes.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest.
4. Anemia: The patient's acute on chronic anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiovascular instability.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers increase her risk of developing decubitus ulcers.
6. Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and presence of wounds/injuries increase her risk of developing infections, particularly SSI.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of IBD and recent antibiotic use increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's hypotension, oliguria, and anemia may lead to cardiovascular instability, including cardiac arrest.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's recent antibiotic use and presence of respiratory failure increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and recent immobilization increase her risk of developing recurrent DVT.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and renal status. She should be continued on NPPV/BiPAP, and her antibiotics should be adjusted based on her culture results. She should also be continued on hydrocortisone succinate and Cefepime/Vancomycin. Her pain should be managed with Tylenol and morphine as needed. Her wound care should be continued, and she should be monitored for signs of infection and decubitus ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood pressure has remained in the 80s/30s, indicating hypotension, and their respiratory status has worsened, with increasing labored breathing, shallow tidal volumes (Vt), and rapid respiratory rates (RR). The patient has also experienced two distinct runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which have resolved.

The patient's laboratory results show a significant increase in white blood cell count (WBC) from 6.4 to 15.0, indicating a possible infection. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) counts have decreased, and their creatinine (Cr) and glucose levels have increased. The patient's liver function tests (ALT/AST) and lactate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their unstable condition, but they do not have any significant abnormalities in their peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examination.

The patient is receiving amiodarone for their VT, and their antibiotic regimen has been changed to metronidazole. They are also receiving prophylactic heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's increasing WBC count and possible infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status may lead to respiratory failure, which can require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT and AFib increases their risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's possible infection may lead to complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or septic shock.
5. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's increasing lactate levels and decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts may indicate multi-organ dysfunction, which can lead to a poor outcome.

Given the patient's unstable condition, close monitoring and frequent reassessment are necessary to address these potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - Eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Matress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN:
    - IVF boluses as needed, w/ 3amps HCO3
    - Replete lytes PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia
    - NPO while mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT ppx with lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids
    - Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic hypoventilation, CRI, ARF, DVT, MDS, and Crohn's disease. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had several significant events, including:

* Ventricular tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously terminated, likely related to underlying metabolic disorders.
* Acidosis: mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with intermittent respiratory acidosis, likely related to declining renal function and hypotension.
* Hypotension: new onset hypotension on day of transfer back to ICU, with concern for sepsis, given low temperatures and rising WBC.
* Oliguria: intermittent and now worsening oliguria across hospitalization, likely pre-renal vs ATN.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: worsening hypercarbia across past weeks, now returning to ICU, possibly related to poor mask fit on floor, sedating meds, and underlying PNA.
* AMS: multifactorial, including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital delirium, and possible infection.
* Fall with multiple fractures and lacerations: intraarticular right knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture, with associated head injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg.
* Acute on chronic anemia: history of myelodysplastic disorder, now with acute blood loss to multiple ecchymoses/hematomas.
* Crohn's disease: patient has had diarrhea during admission, possibly related to Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia.
* Hx of PE/DVT: patient has a history of DVT and PE, and is currently on SQH for prophylaxis.
* Loss of vision/cataracts: patient has lost vision in left eye 2 months ago, and is being followed by ophthalmology.
* Decubitus ulcer: patient has a decubitus ulcer and is being followed by wound care.

The patient is currently being treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, pain medications, and steroids. She is also receiving IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's history of DVT and PE, and the presence of hypotension and rising WBC, sepsis is a concern.
* ARF: the patient's creatinine is slightly elevated, and her urine output is decreasing, which could indicate worsening ARF.
* Hyperkalemia: the patient is at risk for hyperkalemia due to her medications and electrolyte imbalances.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* AMS: the patient's AMS could worsen, leading to further cognitive decline and increased risk of falls.
* Infection: the patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
* Bleeding: the patient's history of DVT and PE, and her current use of anticoagulants, puts her at risk for bleeding.
* Renal failure: the patient's ARF could worsen, leading to renal failure.

The patient's DNR/DNI status and code status are DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.  Has otherwise
   been in A. Fib
 not a candidate for anticoagulation.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension/Anemia: Initially concerning for sepsis especially given
   low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures all pending. Some response to
   NS boluses but limited due to lack of UOP. Pt. is maintained on
   steroids.  Difficult fluid balance, but are treating with boluses of
   D5with bicarb as well as PRBCs when necessary.
   - Give 1 unit PRBCs
   - DC heparin
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning still 19, will hold and check another
   levels tomorrow
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization, likely pre-renal vs ATN.
   Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable, baseline
   prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis. Now
   making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and now
   with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF fand blood as needed for now
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - DC bactrim
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia being treated
   with BiPap intermittenyl
 she has spent more time on BiPap than off
   and now has skin breakdown as a result.  Is also being treated for LLL
   pneumonia.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg.
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
   - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
     - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
   - T&S
   - 1 unit PRBCs as above
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
   - steroids as above
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but

Summary:

The patient is a 83-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including chronic hypoventilation, chronic renal failure, myelodysplastic disorder, Crohn's disease, and a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. She has been experiencing worsening hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis, and metabolic acidosis, which is likely contributing to her declining renal function. She has also developed oliguria, and her urine output is being closely monitored. The patient has a history of falls, fractures, and lacerations, which have resulted in significant blood loss and the need for blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis may be contributing to the development of ARDS, which could further compromise her respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's rising white blood cell count and the presence of cultures pending may indicate the development of sepsis, which could be exacerbated by her underlying medical conditions.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's declining renal function and oliguria may be indicative of AKI, which could further compromise her overall health.
4. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low urine output may be indicative of hypovolemic shock, which could be exacerbated by her underlying medical conditions.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's immobility and skin breakdown may be contributing to the development of decubitus ulcers, which could lead to further complications and morbidity.
6. Infection: The patient's underlying medical conditions and immobility may increase her risk of developing infections, which could further compromise her health.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia may be indicative of respiratory failure, which could require invasive mechanical ventilation.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular function, as well as her mental status and nutritional needs. The patient's care should be individualized to address her unique needs and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 83-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic hypoventilation, CRI, ARF, IBD, DVT, MDS, and a recent fall with multiple fractures and lacerations. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of progressive hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had two episodes of VT, which were spontaneously terminated. The underlying cause is likely an underlying metabolic disorder, and the patient is being treated with amiodarone.
2. Acidosis: The patient has mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to declining renal function. The patient's ABG reflects progressive acidosis despite improved ventilation.
3. Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: The patient has new hypotension, which is concerning for sepsis, especially given her low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with antibiotics and hydrocortisone succinate.
4. Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening oliguria, which is likely pre-renal or ATN. The patient's creatinine is slightly elevated, and she is making minimal urine output despite significant hypotension.
5. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has worsening hypercarbia, which is likely due to poor mask fit on the floor, sedating medications, and an underlying PNA. The patient is being treated with NPPV/BiPAP and antibiotics for possible LLL pneumonia.
6. AMS: The patient has multifactorial AMS, including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital delirium, and possible infection. The patient is being treated with Tylenol for pain and avoiding sedating medications.
7. Fall with Multiple Fractures and Lacerations: The patient has multiple fractures and lacerations, which are being treated with pain management and wound care.
8. Acute on Chronic Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss due to multiple eccymoses and hematomas. The patient is being treated with steroids and blood transfusions.
9. Crohn's: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is being managed with mesalamine and steroids.
10. Hx of PE/DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently being treated with SQH and holding lovenox due to concern for bleeding.
11. Loss of Vision/Cataracts: The patient has lost vision in one eye and is being treated with eye drops.
12. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer, which is being treated with wound care.

The patient's medical team is managing her complex medical conditions and potential complications with a multidisciplinary approach, including antibiotics, pain management, and wound care. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83F chronic hypoventilation, CRI c/b ARF in the setting of recent falls
   / fractures, IBD, DVT, MDS treated yesterday with lasix for low urine
   output, started on tramadol - hypotensive this AM despite 3L NS, vbg c
   pH 7.09, lac 0.8 - returns to unit for management of progressive
   hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation.
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: two episodes last night, both spontaneously
   terminated. Likely [**3-3**] underlying metabolic disorders.
    - continue amiodarone
    - continue D5W with HCO3 as needed
   # Acidosis: Mixed respiratory and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with
   intermittent respiratory acidosis as above, and metabolic acidosis
   likely [**3-3**] declining renal function. ABG reflects progressive acidosis
   despite improved ventilation
 likely evolving ARF in the setting of
   hypotension and low UOP, check lactate.
   # Hypotension with Concern for Sepsis: New hypotension on day of
   transfer back to ICU in the context of recent Lasix (given night prior
   to transfer with hope for increasing UOP) but minimal UOP. Concerning
   for sepsis especially given low temperatures and rising WBC. Cultures
   all pending. Some response to NS boluses but limited due to lack of
   UOP. Burst steroids slightly decreased day prior to transfer (4mg TID
   to [**Hospital1 **]). Patient likely has some degree of adrenal insufficiency given
   chronic steroid use (for Crohn
    - serial lactates
    - continue hydrocortisone succinate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
    - continue Meropenem / Vancomycin
    - Vanco level this morning 19.5 so will give next dose
    - follow-up Micro / C.diff (Negative x 3)
    - follow-up urine and blood cultures, check c diff x3
    - SBP 100 on arrival, will continue to bolus PRN for low pressure with
   careful consideration of respiratory status. Will target SBP in 80s,
   will give 250-500 D5 w/ 3 amps HCO3 cc bolus now.
   # Oliguria + Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Intermittent and now
   worsening oliguria across hospitalization in conjunction with poor PO
   intake and acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely pre-renal vs
   ATN. Creatinine slightly up on transfer to 2.8 from 2.5 now stable,
   baseline prior to admission ~1.7-2.0, renal U/S without hydronephrosis.
   Now making ~10-20 cc per hour in setting of significant hypotension and
   now with worsening metabolic acidosis. No eos on UA. FEUrea: 26.53%
    - continue to monitor urine output closely
    - renally dose all medications
    - continue IVF for now
    - urine lytes, urine eosinophils (multiple antibiotics exposures)
    - kayexelate PR/PO if becomes hyperkalemic
   - Will hold bactrim dose today
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Worsening hypercarbia across past
   weeks, now returning to ICU hypercarbic with ABG 7.02/92/26 ([**4-7**])
   possibly [**3-3**] poor mask fit on floor +/- sedating meds (tramadol +
   morphine for femur fracture) with likely contribution from an
   underlying PNA. CXR today with worsened atelectasis vs effusion vs PNA.
   Cannot r/o PE given history, femur fx, and currently being off lovenox
   ([**3-3**] renal function) however less likely given that she is on SQH ([**Hospital1 **])
   and that her hypercarbia improvement with BIPAP.
    - continue NPPV/BiPAP
    - monitor VBGs while continuing NPPV for ongoing hypercarbic
   respiratory failure in addition to abx for possible LLL pneumonia.
    - will hold on CTA given ARF/CKD; d-dimer not helpful in this context
    - IS as tolerated
   # AMS: multifactorial including toxic-metabolic, hypercapnia, hospital
   delirium +/- infection. Treating underlying causes as above.
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   - Will give Tylenol PR for pain
   .
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and lacteration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Patient
   became more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was
   then treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was
   discontinued [**2195-4-2**].
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Hold Tramadol given change in respiratory status
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   .
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 5U PRBC (last [**2195-4-5**]).
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   .
   # Crohn's: During admission, has had diarrhea though may be related to
   Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - On Cefepime for HAP
   .
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant laceractions and
   fractures.
   - Will continue Hep SC BID
   - Holding lovenox
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with a complex set of medical issues. She has a history of chronic hypoventilation, Crohn's disease, myelodysplastic disorder, and has recently suffered from multiple fractures and lacerations. She is currently experiencing worsening hypercarbia, acidosis, and oliguria, and is at risk for sepsis, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and creatinine levels, indicating a possible underlying infection and kidney injury. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.

The patient's medications include amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia, metronidazole for possible Clostridium difficile infection, and vancomycin for possible sepsis. She is also receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest a possible underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels indicate a possible AKI, which could be further exacerbated by her underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia and acidosis suggest a possible respiratory failure, which could be further complicated by her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and her current use of amiodarone suggest a possible risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and her current use of anti-inflammatory medications suggest a possible risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and her current use of low-molecular-weight heparin suggest a possible risk of DVT.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor skin integrity suggest a possible risk of pressure ulcers.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and to adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage potential complications."
