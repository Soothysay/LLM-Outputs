   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home with cholangitis & sepsis.  She is improved this morning after
   aggressive fluid hydration and antibiotics.
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: The patient looks improved this morning with
   resolving hypotension and tachycardia, decreased white count and
   increased urine output. Her lactate and Cr are improving, anion gap
   decreasing and her metabolic alkalosis appears to have resolved.  She
   is NPO with INR of 1.5 pending ERCP today.
   - Continue Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dosed
   - NPO with IVF titrated to UOP>= 30mL/hr until signs of fluid overload
   on exam
   - PM Hct & Lytes
   - Symptomatic control with Zofran
   - Trending fever curve, white count
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   #. Oliguric renal failure: UOP improving with fluid administration and
   Cr at 1.9 (baseline still unknown).
   - Treat underlying sepsis as above
   - Aggressive volume hydration to goal UOP >= 30mL/hr
   - Renally dose medications/Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. UGIB/Tear: According to recent lavage the patient is not actively
   bleeding, likely has a small tear from vomiting.  Hematocrit has
   decreased signficantly as expected with aggressive hydration
   - Convert home Omeprazole to Protonix 40mg IV Q12
   - Repeat Hct Q12 while stable, expecting a drop overnight after fluid
   hydration
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&Screen
   - Telemetry
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.  Delerium seems to have improved.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine)
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day to start [**2116-6-25**]
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV PRN when hemodynamically stable.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily, will return to
   100mcg PO daily once taking POs
   #. CAD: Holding ASA, Statin
   #. FEN - NPO, Fluids as above, replete lytes

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   84 yo F from NH w/ PMH if vascular dementia, recently treated for
   urosepsis admitted with cholangitis.
   Presented after 2 days n/v/abd pain.
   In ed febrile 102, tachy to 114 and transiently hypotensive to 90's
   systolic with fluid response.  94% on 2 L.  LFTs c/w obstructive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and ongoing cholangitis and ARF can lead to further septic episodes.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has not undergone ERCP, which is planned for today, and the INR is still elevated. This may lead to ongoing cholangitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and oliguric ARF is likely due to prerenal or septic causes. Continued fluid management and close monitoring of urine output are crucial to prevent further renal damage.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is still elevated, which may lead to bleeding complications, especially in the gastrointestinal tract.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may worsen with ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
7. Leukocytosis: While the patient's white blood cell count is trending down, ongoing sepsis and cholangitis may lead to further leukocytosis.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap is decreasing, but ongoing sepsis and cholangitis may lead to further metabolic acidosis.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of vomiting and coffee-ground emesis, which may indicate ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
10. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, and ongoing sepsis and cholangitis may worsen cognitive function.
11. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and ongoing sepsis and cholangitis may affect thyroid function.
12. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, CAD, and tia/cva, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

To address these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive aggressive fluid management, antibiotics, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with dementia who was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and sepsis. She has been receiving aggressive fluid hydration and antibiotics, which have resulted in improvements in her condition, including resolving hypotension and tachycardia, decreased white count, and increased urine output. Her lactate and creatinine levels are improving, and her anion gap is decreasing. She is currently NPO with an INR of 1.5 pending ERCP today.

Potential medical complications:

1. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's urine output is improving with fluid administration, but her creatinine level is still elevated at 1.9 mg/dL. Aggressive volume hydration and renally dosed medications may be necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. UGIB/Tear: The patient has a small tear from vomiting, which may continue to bleed, requiring close monitoring and potential endoscopic treatment.
3. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen with the discontinuation of home medications, such as Celexa and Clonazepam, and may require additional treatment.
4. HTN: The patient's hypertension may worsen with the discontinuation of home anti-hypertensives, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
5. Gout: The patient's gout may worsen with the discontinuation of allopurinol, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
6. Spinal Stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis may worsen with the discontinuation of Vicodin, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen with the discontinuation of statin, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen with the discontinuation of Levoxyl, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
9. CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen with the discontinuation of ASA and statin, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN may worsen with the discontinuation of allopurinol, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and potential treatment for various medical complications."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing IVF hydration and pending ERCP due to an elevated INR (goal <1.5). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/74 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 94%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Imaging studies are limited by positioning, and microbiology results are pending. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to elevated INR and potential coagulopathy.
2. Infection, including MRSA, given the pending screen and potential for sepsis.
3. Liver dysfunction, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or multi-organ failure.
4. Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, which may exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's SpO2 levels decline.
6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite systemic anticoagulation, given the patient's immobility and risk factors.
7. Stress ulcer bleeding, potentially requiring increased monitoring and prophylaxis.
8. Delayed transfer to the floor due to ongoing medical instability or need for continued ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home recent nausea and vomiting with a concern for cholangitis based on
   fever, white count and RUQ pain.  On arrival to the floor she appears
   profoundly dry despite aggressive fluid hydration in the ED.
   .
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: Given the patient's Fever, WBC count, RUQ
   pain, LFT abnormalities, Imaging her primary process is cholangitis
   stemming from possible gallstones or ? clots based on CT.  Her fever
   curve is trending down with initial antibiotics (Vanc/Levo/Flagyl) and
   her pain is improving.  Recent urosepsis hospital admission with change
   in diet likely contributed to biliary sludging predisposing her to
   cholangitis.  She has [**5-17**] of the [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad (unable to assess
   mental status changes without appreciating her baseline).  The
   patient's elevated lactate is attributable to sepsis, and she is
   demonstrating a mixed metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) and
   alkalosis from volume contraction.
   - Change Antibiotic coverage to Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dose
   - NPO with aggressive NS boluses and oral care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady with dementia who was admitted to the ICU due to suspected cholangitis, sepsis, and RUQ pain. She has a history of recent nausea and vomiting, and her initial lab results showed elevated liver function tests (LFTs), white blood cell count, and lactate levels. 

The patient's primary process is cholangitis, which is likely caused by gallstones or clots, as evident from the CT scan. She has received initial antibiotics and is showing improvement in her fever and pain. The patient is also experiencing oliguric renal failure, with a current urine output of 125 mL and an elevated creatinine level of 2.4. 

Other notable conditions include upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely caused by a small tear from vomiting, and hypertension, which is currently being managed with medication hold. The patient is also experiencing dementia, depression, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease, all of which are being managed with various medications. 

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis worsening: The patient's sepsis is not yet fully controlled, and there is a risk of worsening if the antibiotics are not effective or if the patient develops additional infections.

2. Oliguric renal failure worsening: The patient's current urine output is low, and her creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential worsening of her renal function if not managed aggressively.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding worsening: The patient has a small tear in her esophagus, which may worsen if not managed properly, leading to bleeding complications.

4. Hypertension worsening: The patient's hypertension is currently being managed with medication hold, but there is a risk of worsening if not properly managed, leading to complications such as cardiac arrest.

5. Dementia worsening: The patient has a history of dementia, and there is a risk of worsening if not managed properly, leading to increased cognitive decline and decreased quality of life.

6. Infection control: The patient has a history of MRSA and is at risk of developing additional infections, particularly in the ICU setting.

7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient is receiving aggressive fluid hydration, which may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.

8. Medication interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications, which may interact with each other and cause adverse effects if not properly monitored.

9. Discharge planning: The patient's discharge planning is pending, and there is a risk of complications if not properly managed, particularly if the patient is not able to receive adequate care in the next setting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-ERCP and stent placement, who was intubated due to concerns about ""debris"" in the airway. They were kept on invasive ventilation overnight, with a switch from PSV to VC and back to PSV in the morning. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, propofol, and pantoprazole. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's lab results show normal to mildly elevated liver enzymes, with an elevated WBC count. The patient's imaging studies, including a CXR, show an ET tube in place with the tip terminating between the clavicles. The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis and is being treated with ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the presence of ""debris"" in the airway and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis, which is a potentially life-threatening infection. There is a risk of sepsis and septic shock if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's lab results show mildly elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver dysfunction. This could be a sign of a more severe liver injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis, which can cause bleeding complications. There is also a risk of bleeding due to the presence of ""debris"" in the airway.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is a risk of cardiovascular complications due to the presence of sepsis and the need for invasive ventilation.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, but there is a risk of neurological complications due to the presence of sepsis and the need for invasive ventilation.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a diagnosis of cholangitis, which can cause gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Renal complications: The patient's lab results show normal kidney function, but there is a risk of renal complications due to the presence of sepsis and the need for invasive ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman who underwent ERCP with stent placement for cholangitis. She was intubated due to concerns of debris in the airway and kept on invasive ventilation overnight. She was switched from pressure support ventilation (PSV) to volume control ventilation (VC) and back to PSV in the morning. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/57 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes, indicating sepsis. She has a history of dementia, depression, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not optimized.
3. Renal failure: The patient's urine output is oliguric, which can indicate renal failure if not managed promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of cholangitis and presence of stones in the common bile duct increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia can exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular instability, making it essential to manage her airway and hemodynamics carefully.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can affect her cardiovascular stability and require close monitoring and management.
7. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.
8. Spinal stenosis: The patient's spinal stenosis can exacerbate her respiratory instability and require careful management of her respiratory status.
9. Gout: The patient's gout can exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular instability, making it essential to manage her pain and inflammation carefully.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure prompt detection and management of any complications.
2. Optimize the patient's ventilator settings to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Manage the patient's pain and inflammation carefully to minimize the risk of exacerbating her respiratory and cardiovascular instability.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and adjust her fluid management accordingly to minimize the risk of renal failure.
5. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to manage her sepsis.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and adjust her medication regimen accordingly to minimize the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Consider adding medications to manage the patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy accordingly to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.
9. Consider adding medications to manage the patient's depression and dementia.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her fluid management accordingly to minimize the risk of electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted with cholangitis, who underwent ERCP and intubation with positive blood cultures for Pseudomonas. She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.

The patient has the following medical conditions:

1. Pseudomonal Bacteremia: She has a GNR bacteremia, sensitivities pending, and is being treated with Cipro/Zosyn for a 2-week course.
2. Cholangitis s/p ERCP: She has a history of cholangitis, and ERCP was performed to place a biliary stent.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: Her current urine output is approximately 50/hr.
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding/Tear: There is an erythematous patch in the proximal esophagus, but no bleeding.
5. Dementia: The patient reportedly has dementia, but this will be confirmed with her family in the morning.
6. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypotensive and is holding her home anti-hypertensives.
7. Gout: She is being treated with Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other day.
8. Spinal Stenosis: She is being treated with a Lidoderm patch and is holding Vicodin.
9. Hyperlipidemia: She is holding her Statin while NPO.
10. Hypothyroidism: She is being treated with Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily.
11. Coronary Artery Disease: She is holding ASA and Statin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.5, 14.5, 11.7
* Hct: 33.4, 33.5, 31.9
* Plt: 119, 112, 82
* Cr: 1.9, 1.6, 1.5
* TCO2: 18, 18
* Glucose: 67, 57, 71
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.7/33.4/1.5, ALT / AST: 56/28, Alk Phos / T Bili: 38/0.5, Amylase / Lipase: 21/13, Differential-Neuts: 85.0 %, Band: 9.0 %, Lymph: 1.0 %, Mono: 1.0 %, Eos: 0.0 %, Lactic Acid: 2.4 mmol/L, Albumin: 1.2 g/dL, LDH: 66 IU/L, Ca++: 6.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* CXR: ET tube in place, tip terminates between clavicles.
* ERCP Report: An erythematous patch without any evidence of active bleeding was seen in the proximal esophagus. A medium size hiatal hernia was seen. Three stones ranging in size from 6mm to 10mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct. There was post-obstructive dilation. A detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to history of cholangitis. Successful placement of a 10FR by 7 cm Cotton biliary stent. Some stone fragments/sludge and black bile mixed with pus was seen draining from the CBD stent.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue Cipro/Zosyn for a 2-week course, narrowing or broadening based on returning microbiology.
* Continue fluid resuscitation and electrolyte repletion.
* Hold home medications, including anti-hypertensives, Statin, and ASA.
* Continue Lidoderm patch and hold Vicodin.
* Consider Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
* Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily.
* Continue Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other day.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to Pseudomonal bacteremia
* Renal failure due to oliguric renal failure
* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to erythematous patch in the proximal esophagus
* Deterioration of respiratory status due to volume overload
* Cardiac complications due to coronary artery disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to cholangitis
* Deterioration of neurological status due to dementia
* Hypothyroidism
* Hyperlipidemia

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.

   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old woman, was admitted with cholangitis and underwent ERCP with stent placement. She was intubated due to concerns about debris in her airway and remained intubated overnight. The patient was successfully extubated, but appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation. She has a pseudomonal bacteremia, and antibiotics have been continued for two weeks. The patient has several medical conditions, including thrombocytopenia, oliguric renal failure, dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to pseudomonal bacteremia, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can increase the risk of bleeding and organ failure.
3. Oliguric renal failure can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and increased risk of complications.
5. Dementia and depression can worsen with prolonged ICU stay and may impact the patient's ability to recover.
6. Spinal stenosis and gout can increase the risk of complications with prolonged immobility and may require adjustments to pain management and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Hypothyroidism can impact the patient's metabolism and hormone regulation, which may require adjustments to medication and monitoring.
8. CAD can increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for two weeks to treat pseudomonal bacteremia.
2. Monitor thrombocytopenia and consider transfusions for fibrinogen <100.
3. Manage fluid overload by giving fluids throughout the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix.
4. Monitor renal function and consider adjusting medications for oliguric renal failure.
5. Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock, and consider adjusting antibiotic therapy if necessary.
6. Consider adjusting pain management and anticoagulation therapy for spinal stenosis and gout.
7. Monitor for signs of hypothyroidism and adjust medication as necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was previously intubated and is now extubated. They have a history of cholangitis and are being treated with antibiotics, including Zosyn and ciprofloxacin. The patient's blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and they are awaiting sensitivity results. They are receiving advanced diet and continue to receive abx. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/75 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. They have a history of liver dysfunction and are being monitored for signs of liver failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's history of cholangitis and ongoing liver dysfunction increase their risk of developing further complications, such as liver failure or abscesses.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory support increase their risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of liver dysfunction and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase their risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Liver failure: The patient's history of liver dysfunction and ongoing liver injury increase their risk of developing liver failure.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiovascular disease and ongoing stress increase their risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA, Statin
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, No IVF, replete lytes
   #. Access - PIV x2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old lady, was admitted with cholangitis and underwent ERCP with stent placement. She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation. Her blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and she is being treated with Cipro and Zosyn. She has thrombocytopenia, oliguric renal failure, and is at risk for developing DIC. She is also experiencing fluid overload, and her code status has been changed to DNR only.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonal Bacteremia: The patient's GNR bacteremia is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to septicemia, sepsis, and organ failure if not properly treated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is concerning for DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications if not managed promptly.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's current urine output is oliguric, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient is currently fluid overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and cardiovascular complications if not managed promptly.
5. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, which can affect her cognitive function and ability to follow medical instructions.
6. Gout: The patient is at risk for gout flares due to her current medical condition and treatment with allopurinol.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen during her hospitalization, which can increase her risk for cardiovascular complications.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require adjustment during her hospitalization, which can affect her thyroid hormone levels and overall health.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Cipro and Zosyn for the treatment of Pseudomonal bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing cryoprecipitate if her platelet count is <100.
3. Manage the patient's fluid overload by administering diuretics and monitoring her urine output.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's antihypertensive medications to manage her blood pressure.
5. Monitor the patient's cognitive function and adjust her medications accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications accordingly.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's thyroid hormone replacement therapy during her hospitalization.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including Pseudomonal bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, oliguric renal failure, fluid overload, and dementia. It is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal health outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted with cholangitis, who underwent ERCP and intubation. She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation. She has positive blood cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive cocci. She is receiving antibiotics, and her condition is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonal Bacteremia: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock and multi-organ failure due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to acute kidney injury and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's volume overload may lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and other complications if not managed promptly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she undergoes invasive procedures.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent ERCP and intubation may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and other complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support and potential reintubation may lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension, cardiac disease, and potential cardiac failure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust antacid therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust respiratory support as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed.
8. Consider consultation with infectious disease, nephrology, and cardiology specialists as needed.

Please note that this is a summary and analysis of the patient's condition based on the provided progress note. It is essential to review the patient's chart and consult with the treating physician to ensure accurate and up-to-date information."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia following ERCP and intubation. She has been extubated and is receiving oxygen therapy via a shovel mask. Her blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and GPC, and she is being treated with Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin. She has ongoing respiratory distress, fluid overload, and thrombocytopenia. Her laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and ongoing oxygen requirement may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by fluid overload and thrombocytopenia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia and ongoing infection could lead to sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure and fluid overload may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing infection may increase her risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cholangitis and ongoing infection may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as abscesses or perforation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension, ongoing infection, and fluid overload may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Maintain strict infection control measures to prevent sepsis and other complications.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust fluid management as needed to prevent fluid overload and acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust platelet transfusions as needed to prevent thrombotic complications.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed to prevent cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 6451**] has remained extubated without difficulty. She has had
   minimal PO intake and denies dyspnea.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with edema Tm of 98.9 BP 140/50 HRof 88 RR
   of 18 with sats of 97% on 2 lpm . There is dullness to percussion at
   bases but no evidence for wheeze.
   Labs notable for WBC 13.5 K, HCT  31.9, K+ 3.3, Cr 1.2 , alb of 2.6,
   plts of 54K  CXR with large bilateral effusions and small lung
   volumes .
   Agree with plan to continue broad Antibiotics pending sensitivities of
   GNR/ GPC's in blood. She will need gentle diuresis over next few  days
   to help with anasarca. suspect thrombocytopenia is drug related ( ? PPI
   vs Vanco).  We will follow off these medications.after PICC placement
   she will transition to medical floor for further care. Will need to
   speak wih guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is slowly improving.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenic
   .

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 6451**] has remained extubated without difficulty. She has had
   minimal PO intake and denies dyspnea.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with edema Tm of 98.9 BP 140/50 HRof 88 RR
   of 18 with sats of 97% on 2 lpm . There is dullness to percussion at
   bases but no evidence for wheeze.
   Labs notable for WBC 13.5 K, HCT  31.9, K+ 3.3, Cr 1.2 , alb of 2.6,
   plts of 54K  CXR with large bilateral effusions and small lung
   volumes .
   Agree with plan to continue broad Antibiotics pending sensitivities of
   GNR/ GPC's in blood. She will need gentle diuresis over next few  days
   to help with anasarca. suspect thrombocytopenia is drug related ( ? PPI
   vs Vanco).  We will follow off these medications.after PICC placement
   she will transition to medical floor for further care. Will need to
   speak wih guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is slowly improving.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia following ERCP and intubation. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC, and GNRs. She is currently receiving Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin, which should provide coverage for all of her organisms.

The patient's condition has been stable, with a constant elevated WBC count, but she remains afebrile. Her respiratory status is a concern, as she is not stable on room air and has fluid overload. Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload, and she has been autodiuresing well above her goal of 1L. Lasix is not indicated at this time.

The patient's platelets have dropped from 118 to 54, and the most likely cause is medication-related, possibly due to PPI or Vancomycin. Given that the patient is not bleeding, she will be monitored and considered for discontinuation of medications as indicated.

The patient's creatinine is improving, and her current UOP is >100/hr. She is also experiencing anemia, with a Hct drop, and guaiac is pending. A Picc line has been ordered.

The patient's medical history is significant for dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, CAD, and fen ADAT.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, and she may require further interventions to improve her oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not adequately treated.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk for bleeding if not monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine is improving, but she may still be at risk for acute kidney injury if not managed appropriately.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is low, and she may require further evaluation and management to address this issue.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
7. Infection: The patient has a polymicrobial bacteremia, and she may be at risk for further infections if not adequately treated.
8. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk for bleeding if not monitored and managed appropriately.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her multiple medical complications and improve her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
    Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenia is sorted out
   .
   #. FEN

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
    Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 100mcg PO daily
   .
   #. CAD: Holding ASA while thrombocytopenia is sorted out

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia following ERCP and intubation. She has been treated with Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin, and her regimen has been adjusted to cover all of her organisms. She still requires supplemental oxygen and has fluid overload, which is being managed with diuresis and monitoring of her urine output. Her platelet count has dropped, and her labs are being repeated today with arterial blood gas. She has oliguric renal failure, and her creatinine is improving. She has several underlying medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's fluid overload and respiratory distress may worsen her respiratory status, potentially leading to respiratory failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed effectively.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if she requires invasive procedures or has traumatic injuries.
5. Infection: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, if not properly managed.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cholangitis and pancreatitis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, if not managed effectively.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and underlying cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, if not properly managed.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's dementia and underlying neurological conditions may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure that her sepsis is being managed effectively.
2. Adjust the patient's fluid management plan to prevent further fluid overload and promote diuresis.
3. Consider administering Lasix to help manage the patient's fluid overload and promote diuresis.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust her platelet transfusions as needed to prevent bleeding.
5. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory distress with supplemental oxygen and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust her diuretic therapy as needed to prevent further kidney damage.
7. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent secondary infections.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider administering prophylactic antibiotics to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
9. Consider administering anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
10. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider administering anticonvulsants if necessary to prevent seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.

   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and polymicrobial bacteremia. She has been receiving antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Vancomycin, and has had a successful ERCP with stent placement. She is currently on oxygen therapy and has a continued oxygen requirement. The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and hypertension, and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has polymicrobial bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure if not properly treated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage. Close monitoring and transfusion as needed are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which can indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Close monitoring and treatment with antihypertensive medications are necessary.
5. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air, which can increase the risk of respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has been autodiuresing well above goal, which can increase the risk of fluid overload and cardiac complications.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of cholangitis and has had a successful ERCP, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, which can affect her ability to cooperate with medical treatment and increase the risk of falls and other complications.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment for her polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and other medical complications."
