   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for EGD this AM. Can consider outpatient colonoscopy depending
   on results of EGD.
   - If EGD negative and Pt continuing to bleed, consider tagged RBC scan.
   Will discuss possible scan with IR and notify surgery
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - Will plan to transition vent settings to pressure support, but will
   maintain on respirator for now
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Conside use of Vigileo for continuous assessment for fluid
   responsiveness
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Severe AS--Last echo [**2177-2-25**] shows preserved EF 55-60% but patient
   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve
   area
 will obtain Echo report from OSH.
   - Judicious use of beta blockers to maintain adequate HR to ensure
   adequate diastolic filling time (preload dependence) if tachycardic
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion to prevent both flash
   pulmonary edema and decreased pre-load.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA catheter placement as above
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] INR
   - LENIs; f/u final read.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control.
   - Hold home glipizide
   - Insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission.
   - LFTs and alk phos
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for cardiac ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - NPO for possible scope tomorrow
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 2.7; holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / IV PPI gtt; daily wake-ups
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18X1 and 20 X3, PIVs
   - R arterial line
   - Needs CVL
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent pulmonary embolus (PE), and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress.

The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight, with a total of 4 units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP transfused. Her hemoglobin (Hb) level has increased from 22.7 to 26.3 g/dL with transfusion.

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to flash pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 133/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels (1.03 ng/mL) and a recent echocardiogram shows preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60%. She has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is at risk for myocardial ischemia.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. GI bleeding: The patient is being transfused with PRBCs and FFP to correct anemia and bleeding. She will undergo an upper GI endoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding. If the EGD is negative, she may undergo a tagged RBC scan to identify the source of bleeding.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is being mechanically ventilated to optimize her respiratory status. She will be transitioned to pressure support ventilation, but will remain on the ventilator for now.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient is being monitored for signs of myocardial ischemia, including troponin levels and EKG changes. She will receive high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) to reduce her risk of cardiac events.
4. Severe AS: The patient's severe AS is being managed with judicious use of beta blockers to maintain adequate heart rate and diastolic filling time. She will undergo an echocardiogram to assess her valve function and may require aortic valve replacement in the future.
5. Pulmonary embolus: The patient is currently therapeutically anticoagulated and has a negative lower extremity ultrasound (LEUS). She will be monitored for signs of PE recurrence.
6. Type II DM: The patient's DM is being managed with insulin sliding scale and finger sticks qAC and HS.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl and midazolam infusions. She will be monitored for pain control and will not receive NSAIDs.
8. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and alkaline phosphatase levels will be monitored, and she may undergo a RUQ ultrasound in the future.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is receiving high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) to reduce her risk of cardiac events.
10. LUE pain: The patient's LUE pain is being managed with celexocib and ROMI. She will be evaluated further as her course progresses.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient may continue to bleed and may require additional transfusions.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient may experience respiratory failure and may require invasive ventilation.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient may experience cardiac ischemia and may require additional medical therapy or invasive procedures.
4. Severe AS: The patient's severe AS may lead to cardiac failure and may require aortic valve replacement.
5. Pulmonary embolus: The patient may experience PE recurrence and may require anticoagulation therapy.
6. Type II DM: The patient's DM may worsen and may require insulin therapy.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis may worsen and may require additional pain management therapy.
8. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient's liver function may worsen and may require additional therapy.

Overall, the patient's medical plan is focused on managing her GI bleeding, respiratory distress, and cardiac risk factors. She will require close monitoring and may require additional medical therapy or invasive procedures to manage her conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for EGD this AM. Can consider outpatient colonoscopy depending
   on results of EGD.
   - If EGD negative and Pt continuing to bleed, consider tagged RBC scan.
   Will discuss possible scan with IR and notify surgery
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - Will plan to transition vent settings to pressure support, but will
   maintain on respirator for now
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Conside use of Vigileo for continuous assessment for fluid
   responsiveness
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Severe AS--Last echo [**2177-2-25**] shows preserved EF 55-60% but patient
   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve
   area
 will obtain Echo report from OSH.

   - [**Hospital1 7**] INR
   - LENIs; f/u final read.

   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for EGD this AM. Can consider outpatient colonoscopy depending
   on results of EGD.
   - If EGD negative and Pt continuing to bleed, consider tagged RBC scan.
   Will discuss possible scan with IR and notify surgery
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - Will plan to transition vent settings to pressure support, but will
   maintain on respirator for now
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Conside use of Vigileo for continuous assessment for fluid
   responsiveness
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Severe AS--Last echo [**2177-2-25**] shows preserved EF 55-60% but patient
   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve
   area
 will obtain Echo report from OSH.
   - Judicious use of beta blockers to maintain adequate HR to ensure
   adequate diastolic filling time (preload dependence) if tachycardic
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion to prevent both flash
   pulmonary edema and decreased pre-load.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA catheter placement as above
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] INR
   - LENIs; f/u final read.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control.
   - Hold home glipizide
   - Insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission.
   - LFTs and alk phos
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for cardiac ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male admitted with severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma overnight, and was transfused 1 unit this morning for a total of 4 units.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 133/45 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin level of 1.03, indicating myocardial ischemia. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB), making it difficult to interpret for ischemia. The patient is at high risk for cardiac ischemia due to his severe aortic stenosis, recent acute bleeding, and long-standing LBBB.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 303 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 38 mmHg. The patient's blood gas analysis shows an elevated bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L, indicating metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is controlled, with a hematocrit of 26.3% after transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells. The patient's bleeding is likely due to supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and aspirin use.

The patient's other medical conditions include type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, and dilated intrahepatic biliary tree. The patient's medication regimen includes proton pump inhibitors, fentanyl, midazolam, and atorvastatin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin level and LBBB on EKG suggest myocardial ischemia, which may progress to myocardial infarction if left untreated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's underlying pulmonary embolus and aortic stenosis may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding is controlled, but the patient is at risk for further bleeding if the INR is not optimized.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's LBBB and myocardial ischemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which may require further management.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to his underlying medical conditions, which may increase his risk for infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for myocardial infarction.
3. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and transfusion of packed red blood cells as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust settings as needed to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Consider placement of a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the patient's cardiac output and preload.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for myocardial infarction.
7. Consider a cardiology consult for possible catheterization pending resolution of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust settings as needed to prevent hypotension.
9. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust settings as needed to prevent hypoxia.
10. Consider placement of a central venous catheter to monitor the patient's central venous pressure and blood pressure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Unclear whether bleeding is from upper GI or lower GI
   source. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 with 2U. Not actively bleeding this AM, NGT
   lavage negative.
   - Access: 4 PIVs
   - Transfusing one more unit this AM for goal Hct >28.
   - Obtain post-transfusion Hct
   - Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - INR 2.7: hold off on more FFP since patient is not actively bleeding
   now.
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Plan for [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD today
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - If continues to bleed, will consider possibility of additional FFP
   and possible IVC filter
    - Monitor closely, if worsens would involve surgery / IR
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema from
   AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. Acute anemia may be
   contributing. Although no obvious changes to EKG, cannot exclude
   myocardial ischemia given this patient's risk factors for CAD and
   recent acute bleeding, as well as long-standing LBBB making EKG
   difficult to interpret for ischemia. Also can baseline respiratory
   distress from recent history of pulmonary embolus. Unlikely new PE
   given supratherapeutic INR.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation; Most recent EKG shows alkalemia 7.49
   pCO2 38; continue to adjust vent settings to optimize pH and pCO2.
   - As blood pressure improves may need to control tachycardia with
   judicious use of Lopressor to optimize diastolic filling for
   improvement of cardiac output in the setting of severe aortic stenosis
   (hold for now given unstable blood volume)
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA line to monitor LVEDV/preload and guide
   therapeutic decision-making for lasix dosing as HD improves
   - BPs fine; no need for CVL at this time.
   - f/u final CXR read--pulmonary edema vs. multifocal PNA.
   - Hold antibiotics for now given no e/o infection
   - F/u final read LENIs (prelim negative)
    - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, too high to
   be considered elevated from demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.
   - Receive high-dose lipitor 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Severe AS--Last echo [**2177-2-25**] shows preserved EF 55-60% but patient
   is symptomatic and difficult to fluid resuscitate.  No reported valve
   area
 will obtain Echo report from OSH.
   - Judicious use of beta blockers to maintain adequate HR to ensure
   adequate diastolic filling time (preload dependence) if tachycardic
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion to prevent both flash
   pulmonary edema and decreased pre-load.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PA catheter placement as above
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] INR
   - LENIs; f/u final read.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control.
   - Hold home glipizide
   - Insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission.
   - LFTs and alk phos
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - NPO for possible scope tomorrow
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 2.7; holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / IV PPI gtt; daily wake-ups
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line
   - Needs CVL
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent pulmonary embolus, and type II diabetes. She was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, respiratory distress, and myocardial ischemia. The patient has undergone transfusions and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has a high risk of bleeding due to her supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient is at risk of continued bleeding due to her high INR and recent use of ascriptin. Further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to flash pulmonary edema from AS, acute anemia, and recent pulmonary embolus. Further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure, ARDS, and death.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial damage. Further ischemia could lead to myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and death.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient's pulmonary embolism is small and sub-segmental, further clotting could lead to pulmonary infarction, respiratory failure, and death.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient's severe AS makes her susceptible to cardiac failure, syncope, and sudden death.
6. Type II diabetes: The patient's uncontrolled diabetes could lead to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and other complications.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis could lead to chronic pain, limited mobility, and decreased quality of life.
8. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient's dilated intrahepatic biliary tree could lead to cholangitis, jaundice, and liver failure.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia could lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's medical conditions to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall prognosis."

   Studies:
   ECHO Results
   - There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
   thinning/akinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). c/w mid-LAD CAD.
   - There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Trace
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   - There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.   Repeat Hct at 26, was given 1 more unit.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red [**Month/Day (2) 573**] cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
 will
   likely change to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - f/u GI recs on scope or possible virtual colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Pt. on CPAP/PS
 will continue to monitor and if persistent need for
   [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] keep her intubated
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as she
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   - If hypertensive, could consider NTG drip if SBP>150
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data ([**First Name3 (LF) 573**] and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider LENIs,
   possible IVC filter placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current situation as follows:

The patient, an 85-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolus, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding, is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for continued monitoring and treatment. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a heart rate of 55 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) 26.8 g/dL, with a decrease from 29.1 g/dL on the previous day, suggesting ongoing bleeding
* Platelet count 294,000/μL, with a decrease from 330,000/μL on the previous day, suggesting platelet dysfunction
* White blood cell (WBC) count 10.7 x 10^9/L, with a decrease from 12.1 x 10^9/L on the previous day, suggesting infection
* Creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, with a decrease from 0.8 mg/dL on the previous day, suggesting improvement in renal function
* Troponin 1.50 ng/mL, with a decrease from 1.32 ng/mL on the previous day, suggesting improvement in cardiac function

   ECHO Results
   - There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
   thinning/akinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). c/w mid-LAD CAD.
   - There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Trace
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   - There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red blood cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Out-patient colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Start to wean mechanical ventilation to pressure support
depending on
   continued transfusion requirements, may not be able to extubate today.
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / IV PPI gtt; daily wake-ups
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 [**Name2 (NI) 5258**] (4 total)
   - R arterial line
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ECHO Results
   - There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
   thinning/akinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). c/w mid-LAD CAD.
   - There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Trace
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   - There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red blood cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Out-patient colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Start to wean mechanical ventilation to pressure support
depending on
   continued transfusion requirements, may not be able to extubate today.
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and type II diabetes. She was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and respiratory distress. She has undergone transfusions and has a low hemoglobin count. Her condition is complicated by myocardial ischemia, fever, and a possible infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a central line and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ongoing bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin count is decreasing, and she has received transfusions. Further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock.
2. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and she has a history of coronary artery disease. Further ischemia could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, infarction, or even death.
3. Infection: The patient has a fever and a possible infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is tenuous. Further respiratory failure could lead to cardiac arrest or death.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and pulmonary embolus. Further cardiovascular instability could lead to cardiac arrest or death.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, and she has a history of possible liver ischemia. Further liver dysfunction could lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, or even death.
7. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and she has a history of possible kidney dysfunction. Further kidney dysfunction could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of possible stroke, and her neurological status is tenuous. Further neurological complications could lead to permanent disability or death.

These are just a few of the potential medical complications that could arise in this patient. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) GI bleeding--likely precipitated from supratherapeutic INR and
   ascriptin use. Likely lower GI source given negative NGT lavage and
   BRBPR. Hct 22.7 --> 26.3 --> 29.2 --> 25.2 after 4U PRBs, which is
   concerning for ongoing bleeding although there is no clinical signs of
   this and patient's coagulopathy has corrected with FFP and vitamin K
   5mg IV x1.
   - Continue to follow-up Hct; if continues to worsen will obtain nuclear
   red blood cell scan with possibility of angiography
   - Access: 4 [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require repeat transfusion today if Hct continues
   to drop
   - Continue to check Q4-6H  Hct until stable
   - Continue on protonix drip per GI (18mg bolus and 8mg/hr infusion)
   - Out-patient colonoscopy
   #) Respiratory distress and aortic stenosis--most likely due to flash
   pulmonary edema due to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF.
   Euvolemic yesterday after 3U PRBCs and 1U FFP with 40mg IV of lasix
   - Start to wean mechanical ventilation to pressure support
depending on
   continued transfusion requirements, may not be able to extubate today.
   - Judicious use of lasix during transfusion for aortic stenosis; may
   need to focus on GIB now with plan to optimize pulmonary status as HD
   improves
   - CXRs QD for monitoring of volume status
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin bumped from 0.11 --> 1.03, most
   recently 1.50 too high to be considered elevated from demand ischemia
   in the setting of GI bleed. Repeat EKG shows no changes from prior but
   difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB. Echo shows septal WMAs,
   consistent with mid-LAD ischemia. This may be new, since on her
   previous echo from OSH there was no mention of regional WMAs.
   - On high dose simvastatin 80mg today
   - Holding off on beta-blocker due to severe AS, heparin and ASA due to
   bleed
   - Continue cardiac enzymes to determine if levels decreasing/increasing
   - Will continue to monitor on telemetry
   - q8h EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - Possibly cardiology consult for possible cath pending resolution of
   GI bleeding.
   #) Fever--currently afebrile. Increase in temperature may have been due
   to transfusion reaction or also infection. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable.
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   - Incision and drainage of abscess
   - Continue to monitor fever curve
   - Given abscess and continued fever, and most likely source gram
   positive organism, may consider empiric abx therapy with vancomycin
   although MRSA screen still pending.
   #) Pulmonary embolus--Currently therapeutically anticoagulated.  Per
   OSH records, small and sub-segmental.  Negative LENIs. INR 1.2.
   - F/u CTA records from OSH
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be abberant in
   setting of some liver ischemia and possible [**Doctor Last Name 4871**], but unclear at
   present.
   - When stable, will consider RUQ ultrasound
   - Obtain hemolysis labs (haptoglobin) to evaluate for whether this
   patient may be hemolyzing around thickened, stenotic valve which may
   explain the high bilirubin and LDH.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Finger sticks yesterday 95,
   101, 84, most recently 66
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / IV PPI gtt; daily wake-ups
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 [**Name2 (NI) 5258**] (4 total)
   - R arterial line

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 85-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a history of severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. She has been receiving transfusions, including 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), due to ongoing bleeding and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 55 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/40 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for GI bleeding.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ongoing bleeding: Despite receiving transfusions, the patient's hemoglobin level is still decreasing, and she may require additional transfusions.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to her severe aortic stenosis and flash pulmonary edema.
3. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting myocardial ischemia or infarction.
4. Infection: The patient has a small abscess at the back of her neck and is febrile, which may be due to a hospital-acquired infection.
5. Pulmonary embolus: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolus and is currently therapeutically anticoagulated.
6. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient has a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, which may be causing mild liver dysfunction.
7. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and is currently taking simvastatin.
8. Type II DM: The patient has type II diabetes, which may require adjustments to her insulin therapy.
9. Osteoarthritis: The patient has osteoarthritis, which may require pain management and may impact her mobility.
10. LUE pain: The patient has LUE pain, which may be due to a variety of causes, including ischemia or bursitis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued transfusions as needed to address ongoing bleeding.
2. Weaning of mechanical ventilation to pressure support.
3. Judicious use of lasix during transfusions to manage fluid balance.
4. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes to determine if levels are decreasing or increasing.
5. Continued monitoring of fever curve to assess for signs of infection.
6. Incision and drainage of abscess.
7. Consideration of empiric antibiotic therapy with vancomycin.
8. Evaluation of dilated intrahepatic biliary tree with RUQ ultrasound and hemolysis labs.
9. Management of type II DM with insulin sliding scale.
10. Pain management with fentanyl and midazolam infusions.
11. Evaluation of LUE pain with CE and ROMI.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Studies:
   Abdominal CT (prelim): significant biliary ductal dilatation but no
   pancreatic mass; Ddx ampullary stenosis or choledochal cyst. Left
   adrenal thickening without nodule.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now.
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:

   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent pulmonary embolus (PE), and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has a history of severe AS, recent PE, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 318 mL. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is 343 mmHg, and the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's troponin levels have peaked at 1.50 and have downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, and 1.11. The patient's cardiac enzymes are being cycled every 8 hours. The patient has a history of severe AS and recent PE, and the physician is concerned about ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and the physician suspects a lower GI source precipitated by supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and ascriptin use. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable at 31.6%, and there are no signs of active bleeding.
* Infectious status: The patient has a small abscess at the back of her neck, and the physician is considering hospital-acquired infections given the patient's recent discharge. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 13.0 K/uL, and the physician is covering the patient with ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) for now.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is 0.8 mg/dL, and the physician is monitoring the patient's fluid status and electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and the physician may need to consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of severe AS and recent PE puts her at risk for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. The physician should continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and consider a cardiology consult/path when the patient is more stable.
3. Infection: The patient's small abscess at the back of her neck and climbing WBC count suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired infections. The physician should continue to monitor the patient's microbiology data and consider antibiotics if necessary.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use put her at risk for further bleeding. The physician should continue to monitor the patient's Hct and consider further transfusions if necessary.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and the physician should continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolytes to prevent renal failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the physician should continue to monitor the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, infectious, and renal status closely and consider further interventions as necessary."

   Studies:
   Abdominal CT (prelim): significant biliary ductal dilatation but no
   pancreatic mass; Ddx ampullary stenosis or choledochal cyst. Left
   adrenal thickening without nodule.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now.
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Continue insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe aortic stenosis (AS), recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. The patient has a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypercholesterolemia, and a history of cardiac disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 15-26 inspirations per minute. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, PaO2 of 343, and PaCO2 of 46.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus. The troponin levels have peaked and downtrended, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or repeat event. The patient has a new regional wall motion abnormality (WMA) noted on echocardiogram (TTE).
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which is likely lower GI source precipitated by supratherapeutic INR and aspirin use. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 31.6, and there are no signs of active bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a small abscess at the back of the neck, which was drained and covered with ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient also has a fever, which may be due to transfusion reaction or infection. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is 11.0, and the differential count shows a slight increase in neutrophils.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is 0.8, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 34.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the ABG results show a slightly elevated PaCO2. The patient may require further respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin levels have peaked and downtrended, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or repeat event. The patient may require further cardiac enzymes monitoring and cardiac consult/path.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and the patient's Hct level is stable at 31.6. However, the patient may require further monitoring and treatment for GI bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a small abscess at the back of the neck, which was drained and covered with ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient may require further antibiotic coverage and monitoring for infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is 0.8, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 34. The patient may require further monitoring and treatment for renal failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: Continue CPAP/PSV ventilation and wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today pending assured cardiac status (troponins downtrending).
* Cardiovascular management: Continue high-dose simvastatin at 80mg, continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h, and consider cardiology consult/path when more stable.
* Gastrointestinal management: Continue to monitor for GI bleeding, and consider endoscopy from below when patient is stable and on floor.
* Infection management: Continue to cover the abscess with ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn), and consider further antibiotic coverage and monitoring for infection.
* Renal management: Continue to monitor renal function, and consider further treatment for renal failure if necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical condition, including respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal functions."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   - Will start ASA 81 mg today
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans, as may change in setting of ACS.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now, will d/c today
   - Will obtain repeat cultures, sputum
   - Will then initiate Vanc/Cefepime for broad anti-biotic coverage given
   unclear fever source and multiple possible etiologies including HAP,
   abscess, intra-abdominal source
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   - Will start heparin SC  today
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin peaked at 1.50 yesterday AM, then
   downtrended to 1.12, 1.01, then re-bumped to 1.11 and 1.35. Concerning
   for ongoing myocardial ischemia or repeat event. New regional WMAs
   noted on TTE.
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Continue to cycle cardiac enzymes q8h
   - Cardiology consult/path when more stable.
   - Will start ASA 81 mg today
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   pending assured cardiac status (troponins down-trending).
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   - Arterial line for improved HD monitoring
   - Out-patient discussion of aortic valve replacement.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 31.6 today and no
   signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   Follow up with their plans, as may change in setting of ACS.
   #) Fever-- Increase in temperature may have been due to transfusion
   reaction or also infection, given climbing WBC count. Must consider
   hospital-acquired infections given recent discharge. Patient also has
   small abscess at back of neck. UA unremarkable. S/p I & D of abscess
   - Covering with unasyn for now, will d/c today
   - Will obtain repeat cultures, sputum
   - Will then initiate Vanc/Cefepime for broad anti-biotic coverage given
   unclear fever source and multiple possible etiologies including HAP,
   abscess, intra-abdominal source
   - F/u abscess culture data
   - Continue to follow-up microbiology data (blood and urine cultures
   from when febrile)
   - Obtain C. diff and stool cultures
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots for now
   - If shows any evidence of clot formation, will consider IVC filter
   placement.
   - Will start heparin SC  today
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] require ERCP fur further evaluation while on floor.
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   # LUE pain: Etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 54**] family, this was the patient
   primary complaint today.  Prior OSH records with negative LUE u/s.
   Also with history of possible bursitis.  Given acute bleed and h/o CAD,
   obviously concerning for ischemia.
    - CE as above, ROMI
    - Control pain
    - Evaluate further as course progresses, when patient able to provide
   more details
    - Could consider x-ray of shoulder though no h/o trauma
   #) FEN:
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - INR 1.2, holding heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today.
   - Have IV NTG available during extubation in case pressures rise
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat, so watch carefully for post-extubation
   auto-diuresis.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, NTG vs low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - Can stop tracking enzymes unless pt reports new symptoms
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - GI signing off at this time, will follow from afar; possible scope
   from below when patient is stable +/- ERCP.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today.
   - Have IV NTG available during extubation in case pressures rise
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat, so watch carefully for post-extubation
   auto-diuresis.
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, NTG vs low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - Can stop tracking enzymes unless pt reports new symptoms
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - GI signing off at this time, will follow from afar; possible scope
   from below when patient is stable +/- ERCP.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Make NPO
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: has not had bowel movement since Sunday. Expect her to
   move bowels once tube feeds are further advanced.
   - Colace + Bisacodyl x 1 today

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary of Condition:**

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin, admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. She has undergone transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a component of developing pneumonia, which may compromise her respiratory status.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Distress:** The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to flash pulmonary edema caused by severe AS and transfusion. Weaning off ventilation for extubation is planned, but the patient will require close monitoring for post-extubation auto-diuresis.
2. **Myocardial Ischemia:** The patient's troponin levels are trending down, consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed. Cardiology has recommended continuing high-dose simvastatin and ASA, and monitoring for new symptoms.
3. **Fever:** The patient's low-grade temperature may be due to VAP/HAP, abscess, or abdominal pathology. Broad antibiotic coverage is being provided, and micro data is being followed.
4. **GI Bleeding:** The patient's Hct is stable, and there are no signs of active bleeding. However, the patient is at risk for further bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR and aspirin use.
5. **Pulmonary Embolism:** Although the patient's CT scan is limited due to motion artifact, the radiologist has noted interstitial edema, which may have been an underlying cause of the patient's chronic dyspnea.
6. **Dilated Intrahepatic Biliary Tree:** The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, and there is a possible choledochal cyst.
7. **Type II DM:** The patient's glucose levels are low, and insulin therapy is being held.
8. **Osteoarthritis:** The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam for pain relief, and NSAIDs are contraindicated.
9. **Hypercholesterolemia:** The patient is receiving 80mg of atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
10. **Constipation:** The patient has not had a bowel movement since Sunday and is expected to move bowels once tube feeds are further advanced.

**Plan:**

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean off gradually.
2. Monitor for post-extubation auto-diuresis and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue broad antibiotic coverage for VAP/HAP and abscess.
4. Monitor for new symptoms of myocardial ischemia and adjust medication as needed.
5. Hold insulin therapy and monitor glucose levels.
6. Continue fentanyl and midazolam for pain relief, and monitor for constipation.
7. Replete lytes PRN and monitor for electrolyte imbalance.
8. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; continue another three sets to monitor for any
   new cardiac injury that may occur in the context of the stress of
   extubation.
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: has not had bowel movement since Sunday. Expect her to
   move bowels once tube feeds are further advanced.
   - Colace x 1 today
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Fentanyl PRN for pain after extubation.
   - Check I/O in PM no more lasix. Would like stay even to slightly
   positive given that she has diuresed close to 2L over the last several
   days and her JVP is flat.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; continue another three sets to monitor for any
   new cardiac injury that may occur in the context of the stress of
   extubation.
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: has not had bowel movement since Sunday. Expect her to
   move bowels once tube feeds are further advanced.
   - Colace x 1 today
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees

The patient is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. She has a history of type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/36 mmHg. Her troponin levels have been trending down, suggesting demand ischemia, and her WBC count is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia, which may compromise her respiratory status.
2. Myocardial Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are trending down, but she may still be at risk for cardiac injury due to the stress of extubation.
3. Fever: The patient has remained febrile with low-grade temperature, and potential sources of infection include abscess, VAP/HAP, or abdominal pathology.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient's Hct is stable, but she may still be at risk for further bleeding due to her supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and her anticoagulation status is currently reversed due to her critical GI bleed.
6. Dilated Intrahepatic Biliary Tree: The patient has a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, which may require further work-up and management.
7. Type II Diabetes: The patient's glucose levels are currently low, and she may require insulin therapy in the future.
8. Osteoarthritis: The patient's pain control is currently managed with Fentanyl and Midazolam, but she may require further pain management strategies.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is currently on atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia, but her cholesterol levels may require further management.

Action Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider weaning her off ventilation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's myocardial ischemia with high-dose simvastatin and ASA.
3. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider further work-up for potential sources of infection.
4. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and consider further work-up for potential causes.
5. Monitor the patient's anticoagulation status and consider further work-up for potential pulmonary embolism.
6. Consider further work-up for the patient's dilated intrahepatic biliary tree and potential pancreatic mass.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and consider insulin therapy if necessary.
8. Continue to manage the patient's pain control with Fentanyl and Midazolam, and consider further pain management strategies.
9. Monitor the patient's cholesterol levels and consider further management strategies."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; if continuing to climb down we can stop cycling
   cardiac enzymes today
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   - Chlorhexadine glucontate / Protonix [**Hospital1 7**]
   - HOB > 30 degrees
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress.
   #) Respiratory distress--most likely due to flash pulmonary edema due
   to severe AS in the setting of transfusion, IVF. S/p transfusion of 5U
   pRBCs and 3+ U FFP. Currently running negative compared to admission.
   [**Month (only) 51**] have a component of developing pneumonia which may compromise
   respiratory status.
   - On CPAP/PSV. Wean off ventilation for plan for extubation today
   - Check I/O in PM, give lasix gingerly if positive. Goal for I=O today.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending once again, most
   recently 1.03 at 3am. Cards believes this to be consistent with demand
   ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - F/u BP today. If high, can start low-dose beta blocker per cardiology
   recs
   - 11am cardiac enzymes; if continuing to climb down we can stop cycling
   cardiac enzymes today
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Fever-- Has remained febrile with low-grade temperature although
   currently afebrile. Potential sources include abscess (s/p I&D),
   VAP/HAP (new developing opacity on left hemithorax concerning for
   evolving infectious process), or less likely, abdominal pathology. WBC
   count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP.
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Hct stable at 28.7 <-- 29.4 <--
   31.6 today and no signs of active bleeding, which is reassuring.
   - Change to [**Hospital1 7**] Hct; will continue [**Hospital1 7**] since started heparin and
   high-dose ASA recently.
   - Protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 2.1) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   - Per GI, will scope from below when patient is stable and on floor.
   [**Month (only) 51**] also do ERCP at that time.
   #) Pulmonary embolus
Anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI
   bleed. INR 1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is
   limited owing to motion artifact so difficult to assess small and
   subsegmental vessels. Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study.
   Rads also noted interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been
   underlying cause of patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - GI may ERCP on floor
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Will hold insulin sliding scale with finger sticks qAC and HS, given
   that Pt not requiring insulin
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient
   currently on Fentanyl / Midazolam gtt
   - Monitor for pain control, Fentanyl gtt
    - Hold outpatient po medications for now
    - Hold all NSAIDs
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN:
   - Tube feeds started
   - Judicious fluid resuscitation given AS; A-line for improved HD
   monitoring
   - Replete lytes PRN

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) and recent pulmonary embolus (PE) on coumadin, admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and respiratory distress. She has undergone transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She is currently on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPAP/PSV) and is being weaned off ventilation for possible extubation today.

Medical Complications:

1. Myocardial Ischemia: Troponin levels are trending down, suggesting demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleed. Cardiology recommends continuing high-dose simvastatin and ASA, and monitoring for further changes in troponin levels.
2. Fever: The patient has remained febrile with low-grade temperature, which may be due to abscess (s/p I&D), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or less likely, abdominal pathology. Antibiotics are being continued, and further micro data is being monitored.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient is likely experiencing lower GI bleeding, precipitated by supratherapeutic INR and Aspirin use. Hct is stable, and no signs of active bleeding are present.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and anticoagulation was reversed due to critical GI bleeding. The patient is being kept on pneumoboots and heparin for now.
5. Dilated Intrahepatic Biliary Tree: The patient has a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, which was noted on OSH CTA without work-up. Further evaluation is planned.
6. Type II Diabetes: The patient's glucose levels are low, and insulin is being held, as the patient is not requiring insulin.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient is experiencing pain, which is being managed with Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions. Outpatient medications are being held, and NSAIDs are contraindicated.
8. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is being treated with 80mg of atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.

Potential Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema and potential pneumonia.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, due to demand ischemia and potential percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to GI bleeding, abscess, and potential VAP.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient is at risk for hemodynamic instability due to fluid resuscitation and potential bleeding.

Plan:

1. Continue CPAP/PSV and wean off ventilation for possible extubation today.
2. Monitor troponin levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue antibiotics and monitor for further changes in micro data.
4. Manage GI bleeding with judicious fluid resuscitation and replete lytes PRN.
5. Continue anticoagulation with pneumoboots and heparin.
6. Monitor for pain control and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Hold outpatient medications and NSAIDs.
8. Continue 80mg of atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider d/c'ing heparin or ASA in light of new bleeding.
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema.
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient will likely need Picc line
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate

   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now, will
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider d/c'ing heparin or ASA in light of new bleeding.
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema.
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient will likely need Picc line
   - Continued management of packing in abscess
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now, will
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN: full diabetic diet
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: Bowel movement yesterday
   - Colace d/c'ed
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line; can d/c today
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, GI bleeding, and supratherapeutic INR.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Extubation in the morning, requiring 30 minutes of nitro for pressure regulation.
* Poor urine output in the afternoon (5-20 cc/hr) with a creatinine level of 0.9. The patient's urine output improved when they started taking oral medications, but decreased again when they stopped taking them.
* A frankly bloody maroon-colored bowel movement was observed at 7 pm, with a hematocrit level of 29.3. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure were stable.
* The abscess was repacked and looked improved.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count trending down, with a current level of 8.7.
* Hematocrit levels ranging from 27.9 to 29.4.
* Platelet count of 265 K/uL.
* Blood cultures pending.
* Sputum Gram stain showing >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, with 4+ Gram-negative rods and 2+ Gram-positive rods.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Contacting the GI team to discuss the bloody bowel movement and potential endoscopy.
* Continuing protonix 40 QD.
* No need for further FFP or vitamin K.
* Continuing antibiotic coverage for VAP/HAP.
* Considering a percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
* Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and considering a low-dose beta-blocker.
* Continuing high-dose simvastatin and ASA.
* Checking for signs of bleeding and adjusting anticoagulation as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Respiratory distress or failure.
* Infectious complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
* Hepatic complications, such as cholestasis or liver failure.
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting the medical plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider d/c'ing heparin or ASA in light of new bleeding.
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Low [**Month (only) **]
related to poor PO intake. Decided not to bolus given
   history of flash pulmonary edema in setting of fluid administration.
   Now that patient is advanced to full diet, will better be able to
   self-regular volume status. Low concern for hemodynamically significant
   GI bleeding given stable hematocrit, HR and BP.
   -          Continue to monitor [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt is thirsty this AM; encourage liberal PO intake.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema.
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient will likely need Picc line
   - Continued management of packing in abscess: I& D [**3-11**]. Re-packed [**3-13**].
   Needs re-packing [**3-15**] and every 2 days thereafter.
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg and ASA 325mg
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker (consider Lopressor
   6.25mg [**Hospital1 7**] if HR and BP tolerate)
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now, will
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots and heparin for now
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN: full diabetic diet
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: Bowel movement yesterday
   - Colace d/c'ed
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line; can d/c today
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   half hour post extubation
   - Poor [** **] in PM (5-20cc's/hr). Advanced diet. Did not bolus because
   patient looked clinically well. PM creatinine stable at 0.9. [** **] picked
   up when patient started taking POs, then decreased again at 10-12 when
   patient stopped taking POs
   - 7PM - had a frankly bloody maroon-colored bowel movement. HR/BP
   stable. Hct 1t 4pm was 29.3. Ordered for stat Hct; plan to contact GI

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old female admitted with severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. She was extubated yesterday and had a frankly bloody maroon-colored bowel movement at 7 pm. Her hematocrit is stable, and her vital signs are within normal limits. She has a history of severe AS, recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. She is currently on antibiotics for VAP, and her WBC count is trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and the bloody stool may indicate ongoing bleeding. The patient's hematocrit is stable, but the GI bleeding needs to be closely monitored.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient had respiratory distress initially, but it has resolved since extubation. However, she may still require close monitoring for respiratory issues.
3. Fever: The patient has had a fever, which may be related to VAP or an abscess. The WBC count is trending down, which is reassuring.
4. Myocardial ischemia: The patient has had troponin elevations, which may be related to demand ischemia due to GI bleeding. She is currently on high-dose simvastatin and ASA for myocardial ischemia.
5. Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree: The patient has a dilated intrahepatic biliary tree, which may be related to pancreatitis or a choledochal cyst. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Abnormal Chest CT: The patient had an abnormal Chest CT, which may indicate pulmonary embolism. However, the study is limited due to motion artifact, and the suspicion for PE is low.
7. Type II DM: The patient has Type II DM, and her glucose levels are low. She is not receiving insulin, and her sliding scale has been resumed.
8. Osteoarthritis: The patient has osteoarthritis, which may be contributing to her chronic pain. She is currently taking oxycodone for pain relief.
9. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia, which is being treated with atorvastatin.
10. Constipation: The patient had constipation, which has resolved since she started taking Colace.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleeding and respiratory status.
2. Continue antibiotics for VAP and abscess.
3. Monitor the patient's WBC count and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to evaluate the patient's dilated intrahepatic biliary tree and consider further imaging or endoscopic evaluation.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her sliding scale as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's osteoarthritis and hypercholesterolemia.
7. Consider further evaluation for the patient's abnormal Chest CT.
8. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust her plan of care as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements.
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - Will DC heparin and change ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Low [**Hospital1 **]
related to poor PO intake. Decided not to bolus given
   history of flash pulmonary edema in setting of fluid administration.
   Now that patient is advanced to full diet, will better be able to
   self-regular volume status. Low concern for hemodynamically significant
   GI bleeding given stable hematocrit, HR and BP.
   -          Continue to monitor [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt is thirsty this AM; encourage liberal PO intake.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema, although some crackles at bases this am
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient may need PICC, but will monitor and determine duration of abx
   pending cultures
   - Continued management of packing in abscess: I& D [**3-11**]. Re-packed [**3-13**].
   Needs re-packing [**3-15**] and every 2 days thereafter.
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Change to ASA 81 mg based on bloody BM
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker (consider Lopressor
   6.25mg [**Hospital1 7**] if HR and BP tolerate)
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yF with hx of severe AS and recent pulmonary embolus on coumadin
   admitted with GI bleeding and respiratory distress s/p extubation.
   #) GI bleeding--likely lower GI source precipitated from
   supratherapeutic INR and ascriptin use. Frankly bloody stool yesterday
   although hematocrit stable.
   - Contact GI this AM; even though they have signed off they may want to
   prep and scope given bloody bowel movements.
   - Continue to cycle Hct [**Hospital1 7**] unless ongoing signs of bleeding.
   - Will DC heparin and change ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue protonix 40 QD
   - No need for further FFP (INR 1.2) s/p 3+ U FFP and 5mg vitamin K x1.
   #) Low [**Hospital1 **]
related to poor PO intake. Decided not to bolus given
   history of flash pulmonary edema in setting of fluid administration.
   Now that patient is advanced to full diet, will better be able to
   self-regular volume status. Low concern for hemodynamically significant
   GI bleeding given stable hematocrit, HR and BP.
   -          Continue to monitor [**Name (NI) **]
   -          Pt is thirsty this AM; encourage liberal PO intake.
   #) Respiratory distress--resolved, s/p extubation, no more signs of
   pulmonary edema, although some crackles at bases this am
   - Volume management: I/O check at noon and 6pm for goal even.
   - F/u AM CXR
   #) Fever-- Remained afebrile over 24 hours with down-trending WBC count
   most recently 8.7. Potential sources include VAP/HAP (new developing
   opacity on left hemithorax concerning for evolving infectious process)
   vs abscess (s/p I+D), or less likely, abdominal pathology, no central
   line. WBC count trending down, which is reassuring.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime for broad antibiotic coverage for VAP (LLL)
   for 8 day course; 15 day course if grows out pseudamonas.
   - Patient may need PICC, but will monitor and determine duration of abx
   pending cultures
   - Continued management of packing in abscess: I& D [**3-11**]. Re-packed [**3-13**].
   Needs re-packing [**3-15**] and every 2 days thereafter.
   - F/u micro data: blood cultures, abscess cultures, respiratory
   cultures
   #) Myocardial ischemia--troponin down-trending. Cards believes this to
   be consistent with demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed
   - Continue high dose simvastatin at 80mg
   - Change to ASA 81 mg based on bloody BM
   - Check BP today and consider low-dose beta-blocker (consider Lopressor
   6.25mg [**Hospital1 7**] if HR and BP tolerate)
   - Cardiology will talk to patient's out-patient cardiologist re:
   potential percutaneous AVR.
   #) Dilated intrahepatic biliary tree--noted on OSH CTA without
   work-up.  Per family, no complaint of abdominal pain prior to
   admission. LFTs mildly elevated (AST 44), LDH 290. Tbili high at 1.9/D
   0.5/In 1.4 (now normal at 1.0), alk phos normal. Rads noted ductal
   dilatation was significant and suggested abdominal CT to evaluate
   pancreas; prelim read shows no pancreatic mass but possible choledochal
   cyst.
   - No ERCP for now
   - Will sign-out possibiltiy of MRCP to floor team, if ERCP deemed too
   invasive for now.
   #) Abnormal Chest CT
initial concern for pulmonary embolus now felt
   unlikely, anticoagulation reversed in setting of critical GI bleed. INR
   1.2. Reviewed OSH PE CTA with radiologist and study is limited owing to
   motion artifact so difficult to assess small and subsegmental vessels.
   Low suspicion for PE, but again, limited study. Rads also noted
   interstitial edema on PE CTA, which may have been underlying cause of
   patient
s chronic dyspnea when presented to OSH.
   - Keep on pneumoboots
   #) Type II DM
 Unclear level of control. Glucose low, not getting
   insulin.
   - Sliding scale resumed now that patient is on full diet.
   #) Osteoarthritis--NSAIDs contraindicated for pain relief. Patient's
   LUE pain better yesterday.
   - Continue to monitor pain level
   - Give oxycodone for pain relief
   #) Hypercholesterolemia--80 atorvastatin for myocardial ischemia.
   #) FEN: full diabetic diet
   - Replete lytes PRN
   #) Constipation: Bowel movement yesterday
   - Colace d/c'ed
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - SCH heparin
   - Pneumoboots
   #) Access
   -18 and 20 PIVs
   - R arterial line; can d/c today
   #) Communication: Patient and daughter (Family meeting held on arrival
   to ICU, HCP [**Name (NI) 11111**] [**Name (NI) 13842**] [**0-0-**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13843**] (cell)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of severe aortic stenosis, recent pulmonary embolus, and GI bleeding. The patient had a bloody stool and was diagnosed with a lower GI source of bleeding, likely related to supratherapeutic INR and aspirin use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2L of oxygen. The patient's respiratory status has improved since extubation, with no signs of pulmonary edema or respiratory distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a stable hematocrit, with a recent value of 29.3%. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, which is reassuring. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an AST of 44 and LDH of 290. The patient's pancreatic enzymes are normal, and the patient does not have a pancreatic mass.

The patient's chest CT scan shows an abnormality, initially concerning for pulmonary embolus, but the radiologist's review suggests that the study is limited due to motion artifact, and the suspicion for PE is low. The patient's OSH PE CTA shows interstitial edema, which may have been the underlying cause of the patient's chronic dyspnea.

The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoarthritis. The patient is taking medications for these conditions, including insulin, atorvastatin, and oxycodone.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and the patient's hematocrit is stable, but the patient's bloody stool suggests that the bleeding may not be fully controlled.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of respiratory distress, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L of oxygen, but the patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if the patient's respiratory function worsens.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of myocardial ischemia, and the patient's troponin levels are trending down, but the patient's cardiac function may worsen if the patient's cardiac disease progresses.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, and the patient's white blood cell count is trending down, but the patient's infection may worsen if the patient's immune system is compromised.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes are mildly elevated, and the patient's pancreatic function may worsen if the patient's pancreatitis progresses.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that the patient's bleeding is controlled and the patient's respiratory and cardiac function is stable.
2. Continuing the patient's antibiotics for broad-spectrum coverage for VAP and HAP.
3. Re-packing the patient's abscess every 2 days to ensure that the infection is controlled.
4. Monitoring the patient's liver function tests to ensure that the patient's liver function is stable.
5. Considering the patient's cardiac function and potential need for percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
6. Monitoring the patient's pancreatic function and potential need for ERCP or MRCP.
7. Continuing the patient's pain management with oxycodone and considering low-dose beta-blocker therapy.
8. Monitoring the patient's glucose levels and adjusting the patient's insulin regimen as necessary."
