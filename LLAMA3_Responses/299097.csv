You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to an infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to AKI if not managed properly. AKI can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, and further complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infections.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can increase the risk of falls, respiratory compromise, and other complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the risk of respiratory failure is still present, especially if the patient's underlying condition worsens.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock is still present.
8. Infection: The patient's VRE bacteremia and pancytopenia increase the risk of further infections, which can lead to sepsis and other complications.
9. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability can increase the risk of cardiac complications, respiratory failure, and other complications.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which can increase the risk of malnutrition-related complications such as weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   PANCYTOPENIA
   ACIDOSIS
   Renal function improved significantly over past 36 hours. Significant
   negative fluid balance with CVVH.
   Mental status better this morning; patient able to follow simple
   commands.
   Patient has respiratory alkalosis, possibly related to discomfort. She
   has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is probably a
   compensation for the respiratory alkalosis. No diarrhea. Oxygenation in
   good range.
   Insulin being adjusted to maintain serum glucose in range.
   Blood pressure remains high on hydralazine. Check with renal about
   using IV ACE inhibitor. If that is not an option, consider clonidine
   patch.
   Continues with abdominal pain, likely from the VOD. Checking stool for
   C diff. Bilirubin continues to rise. Will ask liver service to consult.
   LDH up; check smear for schistocytes.
   Continue to support blood counts with transfusions per protocol.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with pancytopenia, bacteremia, and hyperglycemia, secondary to [**Last Name (un) 3332**]-occlusive disease. The patient has received FFP, PRBCs, and platelets per oncology protocol, as well as antibiotics for bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 155/87 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95% and ABG values of 7.48/25/94. The patient's neurologic status is sedated, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's serum glucose levels are persistently high, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and increased risk of infections.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell count can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infections.
4. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's ABG values indicate respiratory alkalosis, which can lead to complications such as hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and increased risk of seizures.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG values also indicate non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Lymphoma: The patient's diagnosis of lymphoma increases the risk of complications such as infection, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.
7. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD): The patient's abdominal pain and elevated bilirubin levels suggest VOD, which can lead to complications such as liver failure, bleeding, and increased risk of infections.
8. Cytopenia: The patient's low blood cell count can increase the risk of bleeding, infection, and other complications.
9. Increased risk of infections: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of infections, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's insulin infusion to maintain serum glucose levels within a normal range.
3. Continue to support the patient's blood counts with transfusions per protocol.
4. Consult with the liver service to evaluate the patient's liver function and consider treatment options for VOD.
5. Consider using IV ACE inhibitor or clonidine patch to control the patient's blood pressure.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting the patient's oxygenation and ventilation as needed.
7. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
8. Consider consulting with a hematologist or oncologist to evaluate the patient's treatment options and manage the patient's lymphoma.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider adjusting the patient's sedation and analgesia as needed."

   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.

   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.

 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who was transferred to the ICU for initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and management of hyperglycemia. She has a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, presumed veno-occlusive disease (VOD), hypertension, and a history of C. difficile colitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 34.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/60 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 13 K/uL.

The patient's medical plan includes the following:

* CRRT to manage acute kidney injury
* Insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia
* Tacrolimus therapy to manage lymphoma
* Vancomycin therapy to manage suspected line infection
* Daptomycin and zosyn therapy to manage suspected sepsis
* Defibrotide therapy to manage presumed VOD
* Labetalol therapy to manage hypertension
* Pain management with dilaudid and Tylenol
* Supportive care to manage mucositis and nausea

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and suspected line infection
* Worsening of acute kidney injury due to the patient's underlying medical condition and therapy
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's thrombocytopenia
* Infection complications due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and suspected line infection
* Hypertension complications due to the patient's underlying medical condition and therapy
* Hyperglycemia complications due to the patient's underlying medical condition and therapy
* Mucositis complications due to the patient's underlying medical condition and therapy
* Nausea and vomiting complications due to the patient's underlying medical condition and therapy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent these potential complications and optimize her care."

   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am
   about the possibility of plt antibodies.  Was given 2 units of platlets
   after plt at recheck were 13 and post transfusion plt count was ***.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am
   about the possibility of plt antibodies.  Was given 2 units of platlets
   after plt at recheck were 13 and post transfusion plt count was ***.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Renal failure with a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity likely being the etiology
* Volume overload, requiring aggressive diuresis with high doses of Lasix/thiazides
* Hyperglycemia, with FSBG consistently above 400, and currently on insulin IV gtt with the goal of titrating up the Lantus dose
* T-cell lymphoma, with day +17 post cord stem cell transplant, and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy
* Presumed VOD, with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system, and treatment with defibrotide
* Hypertension, with current blood pressure goals of SBP 130-150, and ongoing treatment with Hydralazine
* Fevers, with suspicion of line contamination, and current treatment with vancomycin and zosyn
* C. difficile colitis, with one C. diff sent yesterday, and current treatment with Flagyl
* Diastolic HTN, likely related to Tacro toxicity
* Mucositis, with slowing improvement
* Intragluteal folds rash, likely not fungal, and ongoing treatment with Tucks pads PRN
* Nausea, with ongoing treatment with antiemetics
* Bone pain, with ongoing treatment with dilaudid PCA
* Prophylaxis, including neutropenic diet, PPI, and no SQ heparin due to severe thrombocytopenia

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening renal failure, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis
* Hyperglycemia, potentially leading to ketoacidosis and other complications
* VOD, potentially leading to liver failure and death
* Infections, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Hypertension, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications
* C. difficile colitis, potentially leading to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances
* Mucositis, potentially leading to pain, malnutrition, and infection
* Intragluteal folds rash, potentially leading to skin breakdown and infection
* Nausea and vomiting, potentially leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances
* Bone pain, potentially leading to decreased mobility and increased risk of falls

The patient's ongoing treatment and management plan includes:

* CRRT for renal failure
* Insulin IV gtt for hyperglycemia
* Defibrotide for presumed VOD
* Hydralazine for hypertension
* Vancomycin and zosyn for fevers
* Flagyl for C. difficile colitis
* Tucks pads PRN for intragluteal folds rash
* Antiemetics for nausea
* Dilaudid PCA for bone pain
* Neutropenic diet, PPI, and no SQ heparin for prophylaxis
* Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to adjust treatment as needed."

   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am
   about the possibility of plt antibodies.  Was given 2 units of platlets

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, now transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - will discuss possibiilty of CVVH on floor
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - continue insulin gtt, titrate to FSBG 100-151, FS Q1 H, will monitor
   insulin requirements to eventually wean of insulin gtt whilst
   increasing Lantus as above
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid PCA
   # Prophylaxis: neutropenic diet, PPI, no SQ heparin given severe

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, now transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - will discuss possibiilty of CVVH on floor
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - continue insulin gtt, titrate to FSBG 100-151, FS Q1 H, will monitor
   insulin requirements to eventually wean of insulin gtt whilst
   increasing Lantus as above
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 18-day-old post-cord stem cell transplant (s/p cord SCT) patient with a diagnosis of lymphoma (Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm, Lymphoid). The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), acute pain, hyperglycemia, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), pain medication, insulin infusion for glycemic control, and broad antibiotics for the VRE infection.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient's ARF may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed properly. The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
2. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HONK) if not managed properly. The patient's risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, may also increase.
3. **Lymphoma:** The patient's lymphoma may relapse or progress to a more aggressive stage if not managed properly. The patient's risk of developing complications, such as central nervous system (CNS) involvement or bone marrow failure, may increase.
4. **Hyperbilirubinemia:** The patient's hyperbilirubinemia may lead to kernicterus, a condition characterized by brain damage and intellectual disability, if not managed properly.
5. **Pancytopenia:** The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, infection, or sepsis. The patient's risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia or sepsis, may also increase.
6. **Neutropenic Fever:** The patient's neutropenic fever may lead to sepsis or septic shock if not managed properly. The patient's risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia or sinusitis, may also increase.
7. **VRE Infection:** The patient's VRE infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or death if not managed properly. The patient's risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, may also increase.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the CRRT as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust the insulin infusion as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain with a multimodal approach.
5. Monitor the patient's lymphoma response to treatment and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's hyperbilirubinemia levels and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's neutropenic fever and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's VRE infection and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
10. Continue to educate the patient and family on the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male with a history of lymphoma, who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, acute pain, hyperglycemia, and neutropenic fever. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) and has been on a pain regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/79 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, as well as a low white blood cell count. The patient's microbiology results are pending, but a C. difficile infection has been ruled out.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever may be a sign of a underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to ketoacidosis, coma, or even death if not managed properly.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding and infection if not managed properly.
5. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD): The patient's history of cord stem cell transplant and chemotherapy increases the risk of VOD, which could lead to liver failure and death if not managed properly.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications if not managed properly.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is minimal, and the patient may be at risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue RRT and monitor the patient's kidney function closely.
2. Treat the patient's infection promptly and aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin and monitor the patient's glucose levels closely.
4. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and platelet count closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function closely for signs of VOD.
6. Manage the patient's hypertension with medication and monitor the patient's blood pressure closely.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory function closely and consider intubation if necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine

   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are noted:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains persistently low, likely due to chemotherapy toxicity. The goal is to maintain a platelet count of 30, but this may be challenging given the patient's continued exposure to chemotherapy.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, likely due to steroid therapy. The goal is to maintain a blood glucose level of 100-151, and the patient is being managed with insulin therapy.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. The patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and will require ongoing monitoring of electrolyte levels.
4. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD): The patient is being treated with defibrotide for presumed VOD, which is characterized by RUQ pain, ascites, and reversal of flow in the portal system.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled with hydralazine, but further antihypertensive therapy may be needed to achieve the goal of SBP 130-150.
6. Fevers: The patient has had fevers, which have been treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's line was removed due to suspected line contamination, and the patient is being monitored for signs of infection.
7. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently being treated with Flagyl.
8. Diastolic hypertension: The patient has developed diastolic hypertension, likely due to Tacro toxicity.
9. Mucositis: The patient has mucositis, which is slowly improving with supportive care and pain management.
10. Line infection: The patient has a line infection, which is being treated with daptomycin and zosyn.
11. Intragluteal folds rash: The patient has an intragluteal folds rash, which is likely due to irritation and is being managed with Tucks pads PRN.
12. Nausea: The patient has nausea, which is being managed with antiemetics.
13. Bone pain: The patient has bone pain, which is being managed with dilaudid PRN.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
2. Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
3. Renal failure progression
4. VOD worsening
5. Hypertensive crisis due to uncontrolled blood pressure
6. Infection due to line contamination or C. difficile colitis
7. Mucositis worsening
8. Line infection progression
9. Intragluteal folds rash worsening
10. Nausea and vomiting worsening
11. Bone pain worsening

The patient's care plan should focus on managing these potential complications and addressing any new issues that arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who is currently undergoing cord blood transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU for initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Acute kidney injury (ARF) requiring CRRT, likely due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity.
2. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 30,000) likely due to chemotherapy.
3. Presumed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with RUQ pain, ascites, and possible reversal of portal blood flow, treated with defibrotide.
4. Hypertension, managed with hydralazine and labetalol.
5. Fever, managed with vancomycin, cefepime, and zosyn.
6. C. difficile colitis, managed with Flagyl.
7. Diastolic hypertension, likely due to tacrolimus toxicity.
8. Mucositis, managed with supportive care and pain regimen.
9. Intragluteal folds rash, managed with Tucks pads PRN.
10. Nausea, managed with antiemetics.
11. Bone pain, managed with dilaudid PRN.

Potential medical complications that may arise from these conditions include:

1. Further decline in renal function, leading to increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure.
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
3. Progression of VOD, leading to liver failure and death.
4. Hypertensive crisis, leading to cardiac complications or stroke.
5. Sepsis or septic shock due to fever or line infections.
6. Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to C. difficile colitis.
7. Tacrolimus toxicity, leading to further hypertension, kidney injury, or other systemic complications.
8. Mucositis, leading to malnutrition, dehydration, or increased risk of infection.
9. Intragluteal folds rash, leading to skin breakdown or infection.
10. Nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration, malnutrition, or electrolyte imbalances.
11. Bone pain, leading to decreased mobility, increased risk of falls, or secondary complications.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. CRRT for ARF.
2. Platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count > 30,000.
3. Defibrotide for VOD.
4. Antihypertensive medications (hydralazine and labetalol) for hypertension.
5. Antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and zosyn) for fever and suspected line infections.
6. Flagyl for C. difficile colitis.
7. Supportive care and pain regimen for mucositis and bone pain.
8. Tucks pads PRN for intragluteal folds rash.
9. Antiemetics for nausea.
10. Dilaudid PRN for bone pain.

The patient's current status is stable, with a platelet count of 27,000 and a hemoglobin level of 30.9%. Her blood pressure is controlled with antihypertensive medications, and her fever has been controlled with antibiotics. She remains at risk for further complications, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage these conditions."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.

   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine
   - sugars have been <200 overnight

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has coarse breath sounds present.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypertension, with a current blood pressure goal of SBP 130-150.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). She has a persistently low platelet count, likely due to chemotherapy.
* Hematologic: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 15 and a hemoglobin level of 27.5 g/dL.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has presumed VOD, with RUQ abdominal pain and ascites. She has been treated with defibrotide.
* Infections: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently on contact precautions.

The patient's medications include:

* Lantus: 50 units qam
* Solumedrol: 40 mg IV BID
* Defibrotide: Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
* Lasix: 80 mg IV, as needed
* Neupogen: 480 mcg SQ daily
* Coags: INR < 1.5, fibrinogen > 150, platelets > 30, hemoglobin > 30
* Flagyl: 500 mg IV every 8 hours
* Zosyn: 2.25 g IV every 8 hours
* Casopfungin: 70 mg IV every 24 hours
* Vancomycin: 1 g IV every 12 hours
* Dapto: 500 mg IV every 12 hours

The patient's labs are as follows:

* WBC: 0.2 K/uL
* Hct: 27.5%
* Platelet count: 15
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 21 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 388 IU/L

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's coarse breath sounds and need for mechanical ventilation may indicate respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's hypertension and need for vasopressors may indicate cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and need for CRRT may indicate renal failure.
* Infections: The patient's history of C. difficile colitis and current use of antibiotics may increase her risk of infections.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and use of anticoagulants may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Mucositis: The patient's history of mucositis and current use of antibiotics may increase her risk of mucositis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of C. difficile colitis and current use of antibiotics may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* CRRT for acute kidney injury
* Defibrotide for presumed VOD
* Lantus and SSI for hyperglycemia
* Lasix for fluid overload
* Neupogen for neutropenia
* Coags for thrombocytopenia
* Flagyl and zosyn for C. difficile colitis
* Casopfungin for fungal infections
* Vancomycin for bacterial infections
* Dapto for bacterial infections

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage her condition and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old patient in the ICU, with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and VOD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving RRT, pain medication, and insulin to manage hyperglycemia. The patient is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for neutropenic fever and VRE infection. The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, neutropenia, and hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and VRE infection increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. VOD: The patient's VOD may worsen, leading to liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and increased risk of infection.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding, infection, and organ dysfunction.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction, stroke, and organ damage.
7. VAP: The patient's VAP may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, and increased risk of death.
8. Catheter-related infections: The patient's central venous catheters may become infected, leading to sepsis, endocarditis, and increased risk of death.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, and increased risk of death.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and increased risk of death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, acute pain, hyperglycemia, lymphoma, and pancytopenia. The patient is receiving ongoing treatment for these conditions, including renal replacement therapy, pain management, insulin therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and they are receiving ongoing treatment for acute renal failure. If the patient's kidney function does not improve, they may require ongoing dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected VRE infection, and their neutrophil count is low. They may be at risk for developing sepsis or other infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are receiving anticoagulation therapy. They may be at risk for bleeding complications, particularly if their platelet count continues to decline.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and they are receiving insulin therapy. If their glucose levels become too high, they may be at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications.
5. VOD: The patient has a history of cord stem cell transplant and is receiving treatment for VOD. They may be at risk for developing further complications, such as liver failure or bleeding.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they may be at risk for developing pneumonia, particularly if they are immunocompromised.
7. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated inflammatory markers, and they are receiving antibiotics. They may be at risk for developing sepsis or other systemic inflammatory responses.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage these risks and improve their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now per heme/onc.
   Glycemic Control:  Lantus and SSI as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. She is currently on day 20 post-cord stem cell transplant and is experiencing various complications, including:

* Acute kidney injury (ARF) requiring CRRT
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) likely due to chemotherapy
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) requiring increased insulin dose
* Presumed VOD (veno-occlusive disease) with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system
* Hypertension (high blood pressure) requiring close monitoring
* Fevers (temperature > 38.3°C) with suspicion of line contamination and removal of the IJ line
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) likely due to Solumedrol
* C. difficile colitis with no diarrhea, but continued RUQ abdominal pain
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes) with slowing improvement
* Intragluteal folds rash (irritated skin) with no satellite lesions
* Nausea (feeling sick) requiring antiemetic medication
* Bone pain (pain in the bones) requiring dilaudid prn

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Further deterioration of kidney function requiring increased CRRT or dialysis
2. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
3. Increased risk of infection due to neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
4. Development of sepsis (blood infection) or septic shock
5. Increased risk of VOD-related complications, such as liver failure or gastrointestinal bleeding
6. Hypertensive crisis requiring urgent treatment
7. Increased risk of C. difficile colitis-related complications, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, or toxic megacolon
8. Mucositis-related complications, such as infection or bleeding
9. Intragluteal folds rash-related complications, such as infection or skin breakdown
10. Nausea and vomiting-related complications, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances
11. Bone pain-related complications, such as increased risk of fracture or osteoporosis

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's ARF and CRRT requirements.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary to maintain a platelet count > 20.
3. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's hyperglycemia and hypertension.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's fevers and line infections.
5. Continue to manage the patient's C. difficile colitis and mucositis.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's intragluteal folds rash and take measures to prevent infection.
7. Continue to manage the patient's nausea and vomiting.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's bone pain and take measures to prevent further complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and take measures to prevent imbalances.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's medication levels and adjust as necessary to prevent toxicity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) requiring CRRT, likely due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity.
2. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20) likely due to chemotherapy.
3. Presumed Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD) with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system.
4. Hypertension with a goal blood pressure of 130-150 mmHg.
5. Fevers/Hypothermia with a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F).
6. Hyperglycemia with a current glucose level of 154 mg/dL.
7. C. difficile colitis with no diarrhea, but continued RUQ abdominal pain.
8. Mucositis, slowly improving.
9. Intragluteal folds rash, unlikely to be fungal.
10. Nausea and bone pain, managed with antiemetics and pain regimen.

Plan:

1. Continue CRRT and monitor for volume overload.
2. Maintain volume equilibrium with 80 mg IV lasix and hold off on further CVVHD.
3. Monitor daily levels of tacrolimus and adjust dosing as needed.
4. Continue Cellcept and solumedrol, and hold tacrolimus due to concern for toxicity.
5. Monitor for and treat VOD with defibrotide.
6. Continue platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count > 20.
7. Monitor and treat hypertension with labetalol or hydralazine as needed.
8. Continue vancomycin and cefepime for suspected line contamination.
9. Monitor and treat hyperglycemia with increased lantus dose and SSI coverage.
10. Continue flagyl for C. difficile colitis and contact precautions.
11. Continue supportive care and pain regimen for mucositis and bone pain.
12. Continue Tucks pads PRN for intragluteal folds rash.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. worsening ARF and need for further CRRT
2. bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
3. progression of VOD
4. hypertension-related complications
5. hyperglycemia-related complications
6. C. difficile colitis-related complications
7. mucositis-related complications
8. intragluteal folds rash-related complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old patient in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, VRE infection, hypertension, pain control, and hyperglycemia.

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressive agents. They have also undergone a cord blood stem cell transplant and are currently receiving defibrotide therapy to prevent veno-occlusive disease (VOD).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 134/79 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 97%, and they are receiving no respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a tender right abdomen, soft and bowel sounds present, and peripheral edema. Their neurologic examination is normal, with the patient able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL, platelet count of 27, and hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL. Their liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 66 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 112 IU/L. Their lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated at 301 IU/L.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid intake of 2,914 mL and a total fluid output of 1,568 mL. They have received 574 mL of blood products and have a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 23 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and VRE infection increase their risk of developing secondary infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
3. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia increase their risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
4. VOD: The patient's history of cord blood stem cell transplant and defibrotide therapy increase their risk of developing VOD, which can lead to liver failure and death.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or other complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Pain control: The patient's pain may not be adequately controlled, leading to discomfort, anxiety, and potential complications such as respiratory depression.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance closely. The patient's medication regimen should be adjusted as necessary to manage their symptoms and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and pain management medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/79 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 97% and a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL, a platelet count of 27, and a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an alkaline phosphatase level of 112 IU/L and a total bilirubin level of 33.4%. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 5.6 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, tender right-sided abdominal pain, and bilateral peripheral edema. The patient's neurologic examination is abnormal, with the patient being attentive but unable to follow simple commands, and having no movement or tone.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they require ongoing renal replacement therapy.
2. Lymphoma: The patient has a diagnosis of lymphoma, and they are receiving treatment with immunosuppressive medications.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has a high bilirubin level, which may be related to their lymphoma or other underlying conditions.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count and platelet count, which may increase their risk of infection and bleeding.
5. Neutropenic fever: The patient has a fever and a low white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection.
6. VRE infection: The patient has a diagnosis of VRE infection, which is a potential complication of their lymphoma treatment.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a blood pressure of 134/79 mmHg, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a blood glucose level of 154 mg/dL, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing renal replacement therapy, immunosuppressive medications, and antibiotics for their VRE infection. The patient will also require ongoing monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings."

   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient called out, however the BMT team was concerned about her
   mental status when they visited her.  She was awake and alert when
   evaluated after they left as she had been in the am.  The plan is to
   call her out in the am.
   - Her lantus was increased to 65 units [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**].
   - Per renal, continue diuresing with lasix and hold of CVVHD for now.
   Continue to hold IV acyclovir and ? of restarting tacroliums.
   - Per ID, continue antibiotics as they are, except change flagyl to po
   vanc when she is able to take po's.  Heme/onc wants a S&S consult
   before allowing her to take po's.
   - She got 1 unit of pRBC, 1 unit of FFP, and a few units of Plt over
   the last 24 h.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient has been experiencing several complications, including:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) with a need for CRRT, likely due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity.
2. Thrombocytopenia, likely due to persistent low platelet count from chemotherapy.
3. Presumed VOD, with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system.
4. Hypertension, with current blood pressure goals of SBP 130-150.
5. Fevers, with a history of line contamination and suspicion of line infection.
6. Hyperglycemia, likely due to Solumedrol, with an increased dose of Lantus.
7. History of C. difficile colitis, with no diarrhea, but continued RUQ abdominal pain.
8. Mucositis, slowing improving.
9. Intragluteal folds rash, unlikely to be fungal, with continued use of Tucks pads PRN.
10. Nausea, with continued antiemetics.
11. Bone pain, with continued dilaudid PRN.

The patient has received various treatments and medications, including:

1. CRRT with high doses of Lasix and thiazides.
2. Cellcept and Solumedrol for T-cell lymphoma.
3. Neupogen for neutropenia.
4. Defibrotide for presumed VOD.
5. Platelet transfusions for thrombocytopenia.
6. Vancomycin and zosyn for suspected line infection.
7. Flagyl for C. difficile colitis.
8. Lantus for hyperglycemia.
9. Tucks pads for intragluteal folds rash.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening of ARF, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
3. Progression of VOD, leading to further liver dysfunction and potential liver failure.
4. Hypertensive crisis, potentially leading to cardiac complications.
5. Line infection, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. C. difficile colitis, potentially leading to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Mucositis, potentially leading to further pain and discomfort.
8. Intragluteal folds rash, potentially leading to further skin irritation and discomfort.
9. Nausea and vomiting, potentially leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Bone pain, potentially leading to further discomfort and decreased mobility.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting treatment plans as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."
