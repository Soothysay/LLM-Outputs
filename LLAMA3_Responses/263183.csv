   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative case of left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is currently on various medications, including furosemide, labetalol, diltiazem, and metoprolol, for heart rate control and diuresis. She is also receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia, with negative blood and urine cultures to date.
3. Hypernatremia: likely from poor free water intake and ongoing fevers.
4. Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance or if it is from acute illness.
5. Hypertension: goal SBP < 160 given head bleed.
6. Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due in part to ongoing infectious process.
7. Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow NSurg recs.
8. FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h.
9. Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress ulcer.

Note: The patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and adjustments to her medications and treatments are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever to 100.8°F, with blood and urine cultures pending
* Hypertension, with a goal SBP <160 mmHg
* Atrial fibrillation with poor rate control
* Respiratory failure, with a need for net positive 5 L for length of stay
* Hypernatremia, likely due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers
* Hyperglycemia, with unclear etiology
* Decompensated CHF, with pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic CHF

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of CHF and pulmonary edema
* Development of acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia and sepsis
* Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia or hypocalcemia
* Increased risk of bleeding due to ongoing anticoagulation
* Potential for seizures or seizure prophylaxis failure

The patient's plan includes:

* Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr to aid in diuresis
* Change in rate control agents to improve atrial fibrillation control
* Empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia
* Increase in free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h to manage hypernatremia
* Addition of glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale to manage hyperglycemia
* Contention of lisinopril and valsartan for afterload reduction
* Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and BNP to assess cardiac function

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize her outcomes."

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative patient following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including diuretics, vasodilators, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is multifactorial, with pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia contributing to her respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and potential need for mechanical ventilation is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and pneumonia increase her risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and potential need for vasopressors is necessary.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and decompensated CHF increase her risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's traumatic subdural hematoma and ongoing fevers increase her risk of developing neurological complications, including intracranial hypertension, cerebral edema, and seizures.
5. Infection: The patient's hospital-acquired pneumonia and ongoing fevers increase her risk of developing other infections, including urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and wound infections.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's decompensated CHF and ongoing fevers increase her risk of developing hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, hypertension, and cardiogenic shock.
7. Renal failure: The patient's hypernatremia and ongoing diuretic therapy increase her risk of developing renal failure.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperglycemia and ongoing sliding scale insulin therapy increase her risk of developing metabolic complications, including hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and ongoing treatment, close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and potential need for adjustments to her treatment plan is necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative patient who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving furosemide drip for diuresis, and empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF, and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. This may lead to further decline in her respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Infection: The patient's fevers and pneumonia may lead to further infection and sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and potential complications, including seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, and potential long-term damage to her kidneys and eyes.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to further complications, including cardiac damage, stroke, and kidney damage.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic therapy to target the underlying infection."

   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular

   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.

   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   -          incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   -          not resolved
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative patient who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute and blood pressure of 148/60 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also concerning, with a need for 5 liters of oxygen and a diagnosis of multifactorial respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Continued decompensated CHF, potentially leading to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
	* Atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Multifactorial respiratory failure, potentially leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
	* Pneumonia, potentially leading to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
3. Infection Complications:
	* Aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, potentially leading to further respiratory complications, sepsis, or death.
	* Urinary tract infections or other secondary infections, potentially leading to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Continued intracranial bleeding or hemorrhage, potentially leading to further neurological complications, such as brain death or death.
	* Seizures, potentially leading to further neurological complications, such as status epilepticus or brain death.
5. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hypernatremia, potentially leading to further metabolic complications, such as seizures or brain death.
	* Hyperglycemia, potentially leading to further metabolic complications, such as ketoacidosis or coma.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her chances of survival."

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   -          incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   -          not resolved
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative case of left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma, complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is also experiencing fevers, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia. The patient has atrial fibrillation with poor rate control, and is receiving treatment for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia, CHF, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and positive blood cultures may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and CHF may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's hypernatremia and hyperglycemia may lead to renal failure, which can worsen her overall condition.
5. Infection: The patient's hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia may lead to infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and worsen her condition.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's subdural hematoma and atrial fibrillation may lead to bleeding complications, such as intracranial bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's hypernatremia and hyperglycemia may lead to metabolic complications, such as seizures, coma, or even death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and diuresis.
2. Monitor the patient's fevers and blood cultures closely for signs of sepsis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control agents and anticoagulation.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely for signs of renal failure.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics and respiratory support.
6. Monitor the patient's bleeding complications closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic complications closely and consider adjusting her treatment plan if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma and is now experiencing decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, requiring a net positive 5 L of oxygen for length of stay.
2. Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia, with UA and blood cultures negative to date.
3. Hyperglycemia: unclear if the patient has baseline glucose intolerance or if it is a result of acute illness, requiring significant sliding scale insulin.
4. Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, possibly due in part to ongoing infectious process.
5. Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, with follow-up recommendations from NSurg.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: net positive 5 L of oxygen, with consideration for intubation if necessary.
2. Fevers: empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia, with plans to discontinue if cultures remain negative.
3. Hyperglycemia: continued sliding scale insulin and consideration for insulin glargine.
4. Atrial fibrillation: increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and hopefully better BP control, with continued hold on anticoagulation due to the patient's highly-morbid intracranial bleed.
5. Subdural hematoma: continued phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis and follow-up recommendations from NSurg.
6. Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis, H2-blocker for stress ulcer, and free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h.
7. Access: PIVs.
8. Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**]).
9. Code: DNR/DNI.
10. Disposition: to floor pending UOP on IV lasix.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: increased oxygen requirements, intubation, or ventilator support.
2. Uncontrolled fevers: progression to sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Hyperglycemia: development of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
4. Atrial fibrillation: worsening heart failure, increased risk of stroke, or development of a mural thrombus.
5. Subdural hematoma: worsening bleeding, increased intracranial pressure, or development of a hydrocephalus.
6. DVT: development of a deep venous thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
7. Stress ulcer: development of a stress ulcer or bleeding, which can lead to gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
8. VAP: development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a [**Name2 (NI) 1008**] year-old, is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a recent fall onto their right hip. The patient's weight has decreased from 65.5 kg to 61 kg over the past 24 hours. Their urine output has been decreasing, but was stabilized by switching back to a continuous infusion of lasix. The patient's breathing has improved clinically. The patient's phenytoin level has decreased to 4.4 mg/dL, and an albumin correction is needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deformity of the right hip: The patient's fall may have caused a deformity of the right hip, which needs to be further evaluated with a CT scan.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output has been decreasing, which may indicate kidney injury or dehydration.
3. Worsening of respiratory status: The patient's breathing has improved clinically, but further monitoring is needed to ensure stable respiratory status.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, may be imbalanced, which needs to be monitored and corrected.
5. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, which may contribute to muscle weakness and other symptoms.
8. Hypermagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is high, which may cause muscle weakness, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest.
9. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphorus level is low, which may cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and respiratory depression.
10. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes, such as ALT and AST, are elevated, which may indicate liver injury or dysfunction.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's optimal care and recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

24 Hour Events:
   -Changed lasix drip to IV bolus but urine output kept falling so
   switched back to gtt.  However, can most likely be transitioned back to
   bolus today.
   -Call out to floor today.
   -Clinically, breathing better.  At one point, pulled off NRB and
   maintained her sats
   -Wt at 61 kg, down from 65.5 on [**10-9**]
   -Net neg 366 in last 24 hrs; prev 24 hrs was net neg __ (? 700 ml)
   -Talked to daughter re [**Name2 (NI) 1008**]
   -S/p fall onto right hip on [**10-6**].  Orig xray was read as neg for
   fracture.  PT was concerned that right hip was deformed.  Large bruise
   of lateral right hip with possible deformity when compared to left
   side.  Follow up CT scan

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative case with a traumatic subdural hematoma, decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been receiving treatment for respiratory failure, fevers, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, and subdural hematoma. The patient's condition has been complicated by a fall, which resulted in a large bruise on her lateral right hip with possible deformity compared to her left side.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and there is a risk of worsening pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic CHF.
2. Aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing further complications from this infection, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and death.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be related to her acute illness or underlying glucose intolerance, and there is a risk of further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and there is a risk of further complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is at risk of further complications, such as rebleeding or hydrocephalus.
6. Fall-related injuries: The patient's fall has resulted in a large bruise on her lateral right hip with possible deformity compared to her left side, and there is a risk of further complications, such as bone fractures or nerve damage.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's decompensated CHF and atrial fibrillation put her at risk of further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure. Pt appears clinically and by CXR
   euvolemic.
      A. CHF:
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Will d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -500mL/day as patient
   euvolemic currently.
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
       B. HAP
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
      C. Apnea: Concerned for central cause esp if has re-bleed vs
   hypocapnea.
   - Will check ABG
   -Will check head CT for re-bleed
   ## Fevers and leukocytosis: Low grade only but has rising WBCslikely
   due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures negative to date.
   - Will check differential and re-culture today including C.Diff.
   - If WBCs trend up or she has more fevers today will consider starting
   empiric C.Diff treatment.
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## ?Hip fracture:
   - Will get CT hip today to assess.
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control. Only has received 3 doses lopressor today
   so will hold off adding another anti-hypertensive (She
s on Norvasc at
   home) until she has reached steady state.
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs. Will re-dose phenytoin today as has been low for several
   days.
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

24 Hour Events:
   -Changed lasix drip to IV bolus but urine output kept falling so
   switched back to gtt.  However, can most likely be transitioned back to
   bolus today.
   -Call out to floor today.
   -Clinically, breathing better.  At one point, pulled off NRB and
   maintained her sats
   -Wt at 61 kg, down from 65.5 on [**10-9**]
   -Net neg 366 in last 24 hrs; prev 24 hrs was net neg __ (? 700 ml)
   -Talked to daughter re [**Name2 (NI) 1008**]
   -S/p fall onto right hip on [**10-6**].  Orig xray was read as neg for
   fracture.  PT was concerned that right hip was deformed.  Large bruise
   of lateral right hip with possible deformity when compared to left
   side.  Follow up CT scan
   -Phenytoin level decr to 4.4 (6.1 recalc for albumin)
   -Nurses noticed periods of apnea o/n. Patient just did not breathe.

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status has improved, with the ability to breathe without assistance and maintain a saturation level of 100%. However, the patient still requires respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, but BNP is elevated.
* Neurological status: The patient has a subdural hematoma and is receiving phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis. The patient's neurological status is stable, with the ability to open eyes to name, smile, and withdraw to pain.
* Renal status: The patient has a decrease in urine output, but this is expected to improve with the transition back to IV bolus.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a small pocket of fluctuance underneath the incision site, but there is no discharge.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding.
* Infectious status: The patient has fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and is receiving empiric antibiotics.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including lasix, metoprolol, diltiazem, valsartan, lisinopril, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, phenytoin, and sliding scale insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still tenuous, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF is decompensated, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Infection: The patient has fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of further infection.
* Bleeding: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding.
* Seizures: The patient is receiving phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of seizure activity.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving sliding scale insulin and is at risk for hypoglycemia.

The plan is to continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust medications as needed. The patient will be transitioned back to IV bolus lasix, and the dose will be increased to -500mL/day. The patient will also receive empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia, and will have a chest CT to assess for pulmonary embolism. The patient's neurological status will be closely monitored, and the patient will receive phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis."
