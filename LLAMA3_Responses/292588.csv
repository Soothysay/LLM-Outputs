   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Resolving with no acidosis this morning and BS
   which are stabilizing.  Pt got home dose of glargine last night with
   HISS for correction.  Now off IV fluids and eating well.
   - continue to check FSBS q4-6 hours (qACHS)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 now resolved, unclear etiology but probably stress
   response from DKA.
   .
   #Pancreatitis
 unclear etiology, pt has been vomiting
   - recheck amylase and lipase this AM
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #Altered Mental Status
 most likely from severe DKA, appears to be
   improving.
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehydration. MB index trending down, troponin elevation may be
   in the setting of renal failure.
   - getting ASA
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct, outpatient workup
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -clonidine restarted yesterday for hypertension
   .
   # Depression
 per psych, may need inpatient psych once medically
   cleared.  Psych is following.
   - continue to provide emotional support
   #FEN
 diabetic diet, repleting lytes frequently (especially potassium)
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .
   #HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 765**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3387**] (father); mother is [**Name (NI) 3388**]

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  38 yo F with DMI c/b vascular ds, global
   systolic CHF with EF 30
s, recent BKA, and depression, admitted  from
   group home with DKA and altered mental status, also noted to have tox +
   cocaine, leukocytosis, LFT elevations and chemical pancreatitis.  Gap
   closed and BS controlled on glargine, RSSI, off insulin gtt.
   Transfused 1 U PRBCs for significant anemia with approp bump.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4   BP 133/73  HR 80
s RR 10-15 with sat 99% on
   RA. + 1 L/24 hrs.  Awake and alert, easily tearful, + thrush, MMM, CTA,
   benign abd, RR, BKA site healing, no LE edema; Labs notable for WBC 8.7
   HCT 23.9 (20.3), Na 135, K 3.5 bicarb 21 cr 1.4, glucose 84, trop 1.02
   (up), A  and lfts pending; CXR--no new film
   Agree with plan to continue glargine and humalog. Tolerating
   POs. Fluids off.  MS improved.  ARF appears prerenal in setting of DKA,
   improved to baseline with hydration with good u/o. Continue to follow
   lytes at least [**Hospital1 7**]. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely stress response
   with no clear infectious source identified.  NSTEMI/trop leak is likely
   demand, + cocaine
trop trending down, continue asa, s/p 1 unit PRBCs
   given significant anemia with appropraite bump and now close to
   baseline.  Would continue to follow h/h and check anemia w/u.  Altered
   MS
[**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3412**] in setting of cocaine and DKA/toxic metabolic,
   head CT neg, and depression--now alert and oriented X 3.  Psych c/s
   appreciated.  Chemical pancreatitis
 remains asx and tolerating POs,
   trend a/l.  Check hep serologies and consider liver imaging (elevated
   ggt). D/c fem line and place peripherals. Stable for floor transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  38 yo F with DMI c/b vascular ds, global
   systolic CHF with EF 30
s, recent BKA, and depression, admitted  from
   group home with DKA and altered mental status, also noted to have tox +
   cocaine, leukocytosis, LFT elevations and chemical pancreatitis.  Gap
   closed and BS controlled on glargine, RSSI, off insulin gtt.
   Transfused 1 U PRBCs for significant anemia with approp bump.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4   BP 133/73  HR 80
s RR 10-15 with sat 99% on
   RA. + 1 L/24 hrs.  Awake and alert, easily tearful, + thrush, MMM, CTA,
   benign abd, RR, BKA site healing, no LE edema; Labs notable for WBC 8.7
   HCT 23.9 (20.3), Na 135, K 3.5 bicarb 21 cr 1.4, glucose 84, trop 1.02
   (up), A  and lfts pending; CXR--no new film
   Agree with plan to continue glargine and humalog. Tolerating
   POs. Fluids off.  MS improved.  ARF appears prerenal in setting of DKA,
   improved to baseline with hydration with good u/o. Continue to follow
   lytes at least [**Hospital1 7**]. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely stress response
   with no clear infectious source identified.  NSTEMI/trop leak is likely
   demand, + cocaine
trop trending down, continue asa, s/p 1 unit PRBCs
   given significant anemia with appropraite bump and now close to
   baseline.  Would continue to follow h/h and check anemia w/u.  Altered
   MS
[**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3412**] in setting of cocaine and DKA/toxic metabolic,
   head CT neg, and depression--now alert and oriented X 3.  Psych c/s
   appreciated.  Chemical pancreatitis
 remains asx and tolerating POs,
   trend a/l.  Check hep serologies and consider liver imaging (elevated
   ggt). D/c fem line and place peripherals. Stable for floor transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Summary:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and depression, who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and NSTEMI. She has been treated with insulin, fluids, and other medications, and her condition has improved. She is now stable and is expected to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood sugar levels are still elevated, and she may require further treatment to control her blood sugar levels.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is still active, and she may require further treatment to manage her symptoms.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is still impaired, and she may require further treatment to manage her kidney function.
4. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are still elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage her cardiac condition.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage her hypertension.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and she may require further treatment to manage her symptoms.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is still elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage her symptoms.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are still low, and she may require further treatment to manage her anemia.
9. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are still low, and she may require further treatment to manage her symptoms.
10. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are still elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage her symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust her treatment as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pancreatitis symptoms and adjust her treatment as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure and adjust her treatment as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's NSTEMI and adjust her treatment as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and adjust her treatment as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's depression and adjust her treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust her treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and adjust her treatment as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust her treatment as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust her treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Resolving with no acidosis this morning and BS
   which are stabilizing.  Pt got home dose of glargine last night with
   HISS for correction.  Now off IV fluids and eating well.
   - continue to check FSBS q4-6 hours (qACHS)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 now resolved, unclear etiology but probably stress
   response from DKA.
   .
   #Pancreatitis
 unclear etiology, pt has been vomiting
   - recheck amylase and lipase this AM
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #Altered Mental Status
 most likely from severe DKA, appears to be
   improving.
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehydration. MB index trending down, troponin elevation may be
   in the setting of renal failure.
   - getting ASA
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct, outpatient workup
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -clonidine restarted yesterday for hypertension
   .
   # Depression
 per psych, may need inpatient psych once medically
   cleared.  Psych is following.

Summary:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and recent below-knee amputation (BKA) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was treated with insulin, fluids, and antibiotics, and her condition has been improving. However, she still has some ongoing issues, including:

* Elevated troponin levels, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe DKA and dehydration
* Anemia, with a hematocrit of 24 on admission
* Hypertension, currently borderline hypotensive
* Depression, which may require inpatient psychiatric care
* Skin breakdown on the anterior aspect of the left stump, which is being monitored

Potential medical complications:

1. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient was taking Clonazepam at home, and it is likely that she will experience withdrawal symptoms if she stops taking it. This could lead to anxiety, agitation, and seizures.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been unstable, and she is at risk of developing hyperglycemia, which could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and even death.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, and it is possible that she may develop recurrent pancreatitis, which could lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and it is possible that she may develop chronic kidney disease, which could lead to end-stage renal disease.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and it is possible that she may develop suicidal thoughts or behaviors if she is not treated appropriately.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient has skin breakdown on the anterior aspect of the left stump, which could lead to infection, cellulitis, and even sepsis if not treated promptly.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and it is possible that she may develop further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest if not treated appropriately.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: unclear cause for DKA however pancreatitis is
   most likely possibility at this time given significantly elevated
   amylase and lipase.  Other source of infection also possible given
   significantly elevated WBC.  Urine positive for cocaine which could
   also be contributing.
   -continue insulin gtt, monitor glucose Q1-2 hours, with goal of
   decreasing glucose by 100 every 4 hours
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   -will add D5 to IVF once serum glucose reaches 200
   -monitor K q2 hours, add KCL to IVF once K <5.3
   -check ABG to evaluate pH, may need NaHCO3 pH <7
   -change over to 1/2 NS once hyponatremia resolves to avoid non-gap
   acidosis
   -start SQ insulin once anion gap closes and glucose <200, then stop IV
   insulin gtt
   -treat underlying trigger
   .
   #Leukocytosis - concerning for possible infection although no obvious
   source at this time, patient is currently poor hisotrian.  CXR without
   infiltrate, consider repeating in AM once hydrated.  Urine without
   obvious infection.  Other possible cause is pancreatitis given elevated
   [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
   -keep NPO, monitor [**Doctor First Name **]/lip; hold off on CT for now
   -f/u urine cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -send stool cx for C.diff if stooling
   -d/c antibiotics for now as most likely cause is pancreatitis
   .
   #Pancreatitis - possible cause for DKA
   -monitor amylase/lipase
   -NPO
   -monitor/treat associated symptoms ie. pain/nausea
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehdration.  Creatine
   improving with hydration.
   -continue with IVF
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose all medications
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - got IV calcium gluconate, Insulin in the ED, with
   potassium down to 5.2 prior to arrival on the floor.
   -Will monitor labs q1-2 hour
   -add 20-40mEQ KCL to NS IV once K <5.3.
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -> unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**], most likely due to severe
   DKA and metabolic derangements.  Tox screen also positive for cocaine
   which could be contributing.
   -monitor mental status
   -talk with family about baseline
   .
   #Elevated Alk Phos -> appears to be chronic of unclear etiology with
   elevated GGT as well.  Had abdominal ultrasound of liver in [**8-11**] which
   was unrevealing.
   -curbside liver service re: ? further imaging
   -repeat GGT with AM labs
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehdration, although given h/o DM1 and vascular disease as well
   as recent cocaine use, ACS is possible.
   -trend CE's x 3 at least
   -follow serial EKG's
   -continue ASA
   -holding BB for now as her BP is borderline, will resume metoprolol
   when more stable
   -consider cardiology consultation in the am if enzymes still trending
   up.
   -hold statin for now given concern for acute infection/pancreatitis
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct
   -iron studies, b12, folate
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -hold clonidine for now, resume once BP more stable to aviod rebound
   hypertension
   #FEN - NPO for now until mental status improves, replete lytes as
   above, IVF as above
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: unclear cause for DKA however pancreatitis is
   most likely possibility at this time given significantly elevated
   amylase and lipase.  Other source of infection also possible given
   significantly elevated WBC.  Urine positive for cocaine which could
   also be contributing.
   -continue insulin gtt, monitor glucose Q1-2 hours, with goal of
   decreasing glucose by 100 every 4 hours
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   -will add D5 to IVF once serum glucose reaches 200
   -monitor K q2 hours, add KCL to IVF once K <5.3
   -check ABG to evaluate pH, may need NaHCO3 pH <7
   -change over to 1/2 NS once hyponatremia resolves to avoid non-gap
   acidosis
   -start SQ insulin once anion gap closes and glucose <200, then stop IV
   insulin gtt
   -treat underlying trigger
   .
   #Leukocytosis - concerning for possible infection although no obvious
   source at this time, patient is currently poor hisotrian.  CXR without
   infiltrate, consider repeating in AM once hydrated.  Urine without
   obvious infection.  Other possible cause is pancreatitis given elevated
   [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
   -keep NPO, monitor [**Doctor First Name **]/lip; hold off on CT for now
   -f/u urine cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -send stool cx for C.diff if stooling
   -d/c antibiotics for now as most likely cause is pancreatitis
   .
   #Pancreatitis - possible cause for DKA
   -monitor amylase/lipase
   -NPO
   -monitor/treat associated symptoms ie. pain/nausea
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehdration.  Creatine
   improving with hydration.
   -continue with IVF
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose all medications
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - got IV calcium gluconate, Insulin in the ED, with
   potassium down to 5.2 prior to arrival on the floor.
   -Will monitor labs q1-2 hour
   -add 20-40mEQ KCL to NS IV once K <5.3.
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -> unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**], most likely due to severe
   DKA and metabolic derangements.  Tox screen also positive for cocaine
   which could be contributing.
   -monitor mental status
   -talk with family about baseline
   .
   #Elevated Alk Phos -> appears to be chronic of unclear etiology with
   elevated GGT as well.  Had abdominal ultrasound of liver in [**8-11**] which
   was unrevealing.
   -curbside liver service re: ? further imaging
   -repeat GGT with AM labs
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehdration, although given h/o DM1 and vascular disease as well
   as recent cocaine use, ACS is possible.
   -trend CE's x 3 at least
   -follow serial EKG's
   -continue ASA
   -holding BB for now as her BP is borderline, will resume metoprolol
   when more stable
   -consider cardiology consultation in the am if enzymes still trending
   up.
   -hold statin for now given concern for acute infection/pancreatitis
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct
   -iron studies, b12, folate
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -hold clonidine for now, resume once BP more stable to aviod rebound
   hypertension
   #FEN - NPO for now until mental status improves, replete lytes as
   above, IVF as above
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .
   #HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 765**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3387**] (father); mother is [**Name (NI) 3388**]

Summary:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and recent below-knee amputation (BKA) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been treated with insulin, antibiotics, and other medications in the ICU. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 95.7°F, blood pressure of 101/49 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Her physical examination is notable for a slightly slurred speech, thrush in her mouth, and a small area of skin breakdown on the anterior aspect of her left stump.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued DKA: The patient's glucose levels are still elevated, and she requires continued insulin therapy to manage her DKA.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest ongoing pancreatitis, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, or abscess formation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated, and she requires continued IV fluid therapy to manage her acute renal failure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are still elevated, and she requires continued monitoring and treatment with potassium-lowering medications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to severe DKA and metabolic derangements, and she requires continued monitoring and treatment with insulin and other medications.
6. Elevated Alk Phos: The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels suggest chronic liver disease, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing cardiac injury, which may require further evaluation and treatment with cardiology consultation.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, and she requires continued monitoring and treatment with iron supplements and other medications.
9. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely due to her underlying medical conditions, and she requires continued monitoring and treatment with antihypertensive medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue insulin therapy to manage the patient's DKA.
2. Continue antibiotics to treat the patient's pancreatitis.
3. Continue IV fluid therapy to manage the patient's acute renal failure.
4. Monitor the patient's potassium levels and treat hyperkalemia with potassium-lowering medications.
5. Continue monitoring the patient's mental status and treat altered mental status with insulin and other medications.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.
7. Consider cardiology consultation to further evaluate the patient's elevated troponin levels.
8. Continue monitoring the patient's anemia and treat with iron supplements and other medications as necessary.
9. Continue monitoring the patient's hypertension and treat with antihypertensive medications as necessary."
