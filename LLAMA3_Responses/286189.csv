   Assessment and Plan
   1)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD. Per
   her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding but no additional information
   is know at this time. Differential for LGIB includes hemmoroids,
   diverticuliosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD,
   and neoplasm. No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an
   infectious colitis or IBD. Also, IBD would be unusual to present for
   the first time in a 71yo woman. She has no prior history of CAD to
   suggest ischemic colitis. Most likely diverticulitis vs. hemorrhoids.
   Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here. Her baseline Hct is
   between 25-30 but her Hct on admission today of 35.5. Her INR and PTT
   are elevated today.  She is on Aspirin as an outpatient but is not on
   any anti-coagulation (in light of history of atrial fibrillation).
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 PIVs in place
   - GI consult; consider colonoscopy
   - Hold ASA
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse if Hct<25
   - If PTT remains significantly elevated, consider Protamine
   2)Hypotension:  Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs in 80
   possibly lower at dialysis. Unclear how much fluid was removed at
   dialysis. She also had 400cc of BRBPR which may be accounting for her
   transient hypotension.  She received 1L NS in the ED and her BP quickly
   stabilized and remains at baseline. No fevers or chills to suggest an
   underlying infectious process.  Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but this
   was in the setting of renal failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Repeat lactate
   3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**1-11**]. Patient was acutely
   hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%. She was also noted to have
   increased secretions; she likely mucous plugged given acute
   desaturation. Her Upon transfer to the MICU, her respiratory status
   stabilized.  She is currently on 50% trachmask.  No evidence of a
   pneumonia on cxray.
   - Check ABG
   - Sputum cx
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   4)Coagulopathy: Patient presents with elevated INR and PTT. She is not
   on any anti-coagulation or blood thinners as outpatient. These labs may
   have been draw via a line that was flushed with heparin. This may also
   be due to heparin SQ she has been receiving at home.
   - Repeat coags
   5)ESRD on HD: Patient underwent dialysis today but prematurely stopped
   in the setting of BRBPR. Her BP during this time dropped and remained
   below baseline upon transfer to the ED.
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   6)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   7)Anemia: Baseline Hct between 25-30. Hct on admission was 35, which is
   slightly elevated from baseline.  She receives Epogen at HD.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend daily Hct
   8)Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bleeding (BRB) and has a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36°C (96.8°F)
* Heart rate: 87 bpm
* Blood pressure: 121/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Weight: 58.5 kg (admission weight: 63.9 kg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 31.6%
* Platelet count: 339 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 12.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 4.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe, though focal consolidation cannot be excluded.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB): The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is at risk for recurrent episodes. The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemic, IBD, and neoplasm).
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and she has received fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's lactate level has been elevated, which may be related to her renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her oxygen saturation has been low, and she has required supplemental oxygen.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are elevated, which may be related to her heparin therapy or liver dysfunction.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she requires hemodialysis to manage her electrolyte imbalance and uremia.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk for respiratory failure and pneumonia.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is receiving outpatient levothyroxine therapy.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly elevated, and she is receiving epoetin alfa therapy at hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Recurrent GI bleeding
* Respiratory failure and ARDS
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Hypotension and shock
* Pneumonia and respiratory infection
* Uremic complications, such as seizures and encephalopathy
* Electrolyte imbalance and acidosis
* Infection and sepsis

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and coagulopathy. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypothyroidism, and anemia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a stable hematocrit and lactate level.

The patient has had recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, which has led to a decision to delay overnight preparation for a tagged RBC scan. Her blood products have been stable, with no significant bleeding or transfusions. She has been receiving lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been continued on outpatient epo for anemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which have decreased after a small fluid bolus. Her coagulation studies are normal, but she has a history of coagulopathy. Her electrolyte levels are stable, and her kidney function is compromised due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recurrent episodes of GIB are a concern, and further management is needed to prevent bleeding and prepare her for a tagged RBC scan.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of coagulopathy and elevated PTT on admission may indicate a risk for bleeding or thrombotic complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's transient episode of hypotension after HD and BRBPR may indicate a risk for hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's likely secondary hypoxia due to mucous plugging may require further management with suctioning and bronchodilators.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's inability to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension may require daily small-volume HD and close monitoring of electrolytes.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require ongoing management with outpatient epo.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require ongoing management with outpatient Levoxyl.
8. COPD: The patient's COPD may require ongoing management with bronchodilators and close monitoring of respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
   # LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can likely prep this PM if she stabilizes, if
   she actively bleeds throughout the day, will put her in for a bleeding
   scan with option of angio
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   # Coagulopathy: Initially transiently elevated, and have since
   normalized on AM labs.  The patient does not take any blood thinners
   except SC heparin.  Possibly systemically absorbed in a cachectic woman
   -Continue to monitor daily coags
   # Hypotension:  Had transient episode of hypotension after HD/ and
   BRBPR, since then BP has remained stable with normal lactates and
   hematocrits, and no fevers
   -continue to monitor clinically
   -Follow up cultures
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   # ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   #COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   #Anemia: Continue outpatient epo
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall, 58.5 kg (admission: 63.9 kg) female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable hematocrit, and she has received a small fluid bolus.

The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, a stable hemoglobin level, and a normal platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal.

The patient's physical examination is notable for distant heart sounds, clear lungs, and soft, non-tender abdomen. She has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving oxygen therapy via a tracheal mask.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypothyroidism, and anemia. She is taking outpatient epo and Levoxyl for these conditions.

The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, atrovent, and albuterol.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further management, including endoscopy or surgery.
2. Coagulopathy, which may require further monitoring and management.
3. Hypotension, which may require further management, including vasopressors or fluids.
4. Hypoxia, which may require further management, including oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
5. ESRD on HD, which may require further management, including daily small-volume HD or hemodialysis.
6. Cachexia, which may require further management, including nutrition and hydration support.
7. Infection, which may require further management, including antibiotics and source control.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with regular updates to her family and healthcare providers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis
   # LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   # Coagulopathy: Initially transiently elevated, and have since
   normalized on AM labs.  The patient does not take any blood thinners
   except SC heparin.  Possibly systemically absorbed in a cachectic woman
   -Continue to monitor daily coags
   # Hypotension:  Had transient episode of hypotension after HD/ and
   BRBPR, since then BP has remained stable with normal lactates and
   hematocrits, and no fevers/signs of infection
   -continue to monitor clinically
   -Follow up cultures
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   # ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   #COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   #Anemia: Continue outpatient epo
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and presenting with Bloody Rectal Bleeding (BRB) and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, and SpO2 of 94%. Her respiratory support consists of a tracheal mask with oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit of 31.6%, platelet count of 339 K/uL, and lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. Her coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.3 seconds, but has normalized on subsequent labs.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, clear lungs, and soft and non-tender abdomen. She has autonecrosing toes bilaterally.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* BRB: The patient will be prepared for a scope this evening, either in the ICU or on the floor.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile has normalized, and she will continue to be monitored daily.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has remained stable, and she will continue to be monitored clinically.
* Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to mucous plugging, and she will continue to receive albuterol and atrovent nebs.
* ESRD on HD: The patient is unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension, and a consult has been made to the renal team to discuss daily small-volume HD.
* COPD: The patient will continue to receive Atrovent and Albuterol.
* Anemia: The patient will continue to receive outpatient epo.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient will continue to receive outpatient Levoxyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Hypotension and hypoxia, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular status
* Infection, particularly in the setting of a chronically ventilated patient with a tracheal mask
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen the patient's anemia and electrolyte imbalances
* Kidney injury or failure due to inadequate dialysis
* Respiratory failure due to worsening hypoxia and/or mucous plugging
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and/or coagulopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presents with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving oxygen therapy. Her laboratory results show anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is managed with holding her home dose of aspirin and having two peripheral IVs for access.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, requiring more aggressive management, such as angiogram or RBC tagged scan.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture growing gram-negative rods may indicate a pulmonary infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and hypoxia may lead to hemodynamic instability, requiring close monitoring and intervention.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring more aggressive management, such as transfusions or erythropoietin therapy.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, requiring more aggressive management, such as thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, requiring more aggressive management, such as dialysis or kidney transplant.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, requiring more aggressive management, such as tube feeding or nutritional supplements.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory, gastrointestinal, and hemodynamic status, as well as her laboratory results, to prevent and manage potential complications."

   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and was found to have bronchial respiratory bronchitis with purulent secretions (BRBPR). She required bagging to improve oxygen saturations and received Benadryl for an allergic reaction. She also had a 20cc maroon-colored stool and was scheduled for dialysis and a possible colonoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.4°F, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 110/43 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on a tracheostomy mask.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL and a hematocrit of 30.8%. Her white blood cell count is 12.7 K/uL, and her platelet count is 339 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, are normal. Her sputum culture shows growth of gram-negative rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's BRBPR and hypoxia can lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's gram-negative rods in her sputum culture can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and continued BRBPR can lead to further bleeding and hemorrhage.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if her hemoglobin level continues to decline, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
6. Infection: The patient's chronic medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastrointestinal bleeding, can increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.

Based on these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Continued respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and suctioning as needed.
2. Antibiotic therapy for the patient's gram-negative rods in her sputum culture.
3. Close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin level and hematocrit to ensure that anemia is managed properly.
4. Management of the patient's kidney dysfunction, including daily electrolyte monitoring and consideration of daily small-volume hemodialysis.
5. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis and infection, including fever, tachycardia, and changes in mental status.
6. Consideration of a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and potential sources of bleeding."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch, 58.5 kg individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and BRBPR (bloody respiratory bronchial proliferation). They had a sudden drop in oxygen saturation to the low 60s, which improved with bagging. The patient received Benadryl and is being screened to return to rehab today. They have a history of unknown allergies and are currently on several medications, including Lansoprazole and Heparin Sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.1°C, Tcurrent of 36.3°C, HR of 74 bpm, and BP of 110/43 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via trach mask and have an ABG reading of 7.29/58/109/20/0.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's BRBPR and low oxygen saturation levels increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and even cardiac arrest.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's BP is slightly low, and their HR is within the normal range. However, their fluid balance is positive, which may indicate fluid overload, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stool and history of BRBPR increase the risk of GI bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and even death.
4. Infection: The patient's GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S) and GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S) on sputum culture indicate a potential infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count (278 K/uL) increases the risk of bleeding, which can be exacerbated by their anticoagulant therapy.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including low potassium (3.1 mg/dL), magnesium (9.5 mg/dL), and phosphorus (11.3 mg/dL) levels. This imbalance can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of GI bleeding and BRBPR may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen their overall health and increase the risk of complications.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of BRBPR and respiratory distress increases the risk of stress ulcer development, which can lead to GI bleeding and other complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 71-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presents with respiratory distress, bronchospasm, and gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR). She had a sudden drop in oxygen saturation to the low 60s, which improved with bagging and suctioning. The patient has a history of chronic venting and is colonized with gram-negative rods, likely a colonizer. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 110/43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory support consists of a trach mask with oxygen delivery. 

The patient's laboratory results show hemolyzed blood, which will be redrawn at dialysis. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 12.7, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 339. Her blood chemistry results show a creatinine level of 4.1, troponin-T level of 0.58, and glucose level of 94. 

The patient's imaging studies are negative, and her microbiology results show a sputum culture growing gram-negative rods, likely a colonizer. 

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxia: Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, wean trach mask as tolerated.
2. LGIB: Continue to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past evening with a stable hematocrit. Prepare for a scope this evening or call out to the floor for scope in the AM.
3. ESRD on HD: Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension. Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small volume HD if this continues to be a problem. Follow daily electrolytes.
4. COPD: Continue Atrovent and Albuterol.
5. Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
6. Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to bronchospasm and hypoxia
* Hemorrhagic shock due to gastrointestinal bleeding
* Electrolyte imbalance due to chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis
* Infection due to colonized gram-negative rods
* Hypothyroidism complications if not properly managed
* Anemia complications if not properly managed
* COPD exacerbation if not properly managed

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support to prevent these complications and ensure proper management of her conditions."
