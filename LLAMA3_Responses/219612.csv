   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Images are
   suboptimal, but suggest possible mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior
   and inferolateral walls. The regamining segments contract well. Overall
   left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending
   aorta and descending thoracic aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased
   gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
   biventricular systolic function. Possible mild regional dysfunction of
   basal inferior and inferolateral wall. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   Dilated thoracic aorta.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 359**] is a 75 year-old male with COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C
   transferred to the CCU from the cardiac cath lab due to his high risk
   with significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery while
   awaiting CABG.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient went for cardiac catheterization today and
   was seen to have 90% stenosis in his left main artery.  He has already
   had a NSTEMI at the OSH and is at significant risk for additional
   cardiac events.
   - Continue heparin gtt, aspirin 325 mg daily, and metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - CABG today.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient has normal systolic function, however
   was seen to have aortic stenosis during the catheterization.  He
   appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue enalapril 10 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and diltiazem
   120 mg daily.
   # RHYTHM:  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # COPD:  Per the OSH records, his initial CXR there was clear, however
   he was treated for a community-acquired pneumonia with a 5 day course
   of levofloxacin (which finished today).  He was on a steroid taper.
   - CXR as above for pre-CABG workup.
   - Will DC steroids (given their effect on wound healing) as the
   patient
s respiratory symptoms have improved..
   - Continue nebs: Ipratropium q6h and albuterol q6h prn
   # BPH:
   - Continue terazosin 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   #  Depression:
   - Continue fluoxetine 20 mg daily and trazodone 150 mg qhs.
   #  GERD/esophageal dysmotility:
   - Continue home omeprazole and reglan.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C, who was transferred to the ICU from the cardiac cath lab due to his high risk with significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery. He has already had a NSTEMI at the OSH and is at significant risk for additional cardiac events. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 90% stenosis in his left main artery. He is currently receiving heparin, aspirin, and metoprolol, and is scheduled for CABG today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/75 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93%. His cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and his cardiac examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are slightly elevated, and his magnesium level is low. His liver function tests are normal, and his thyroid function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies, including echocardiogram, show normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. There is possible mild regional dysfunction of the basal inferior and inferolateral wall, and minimal aortic valve stenosis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient is at high risk for cardiac complications due to his significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery, and his recent NSTEMI. He may be at risk for further cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of COPD, and may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, and may be at risk for infectious complications such as sepsis or endocarditis.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and may be at risk for bleeding complications such as hemorrhage or hematoma.
5. Neurological complications: The patient may be at risk for neurological complications such as stroke or seizures due to his cardiac condition and anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 359**] is a 75 year-old male with COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C
   transferred to the CCU from the cardiac cath lab due to his high risk
   with significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery while
   awaiting CABG.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient went for cardiac catheterization today and
   was seen to have 90% stenosis in his left main artery.  He has already
   had a NSTEMI at the OSH and is at significant risk for additional
   cardiac events.  Cardiac surgery has been consulted and tentatively
   plan for CABG tomorrow.
   - Continue heparin gtt, aspirin 325 mg daily, and metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - DC plavix.
   - Pre-CABG workup as directed by CT surgery: carotid US, UA/UCx, CXR,
   and LFTs, and hepatitis serologies
   - NPO after midnight for surgery.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient has normal systolic function, however
   was seen to have aortic stenosis during the catheterization.  He
   appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue enalapril 10 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and diltiazem
   120 mg daily.
   # RHYTHM:  He is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # COPD:  Per the OSH records, his initial CXR there was clear, however
   he was treated for a community-acquired pneumonia with a 5 day course
   of levofloxacin (which finished today).  He was on a steroid taper.
   - CXR as above for pre-CABG workup.
   - Will DC steroids (given their effect on wound healing) as the
   patient
s respiratory symptoms have improved..
   - Continue nebs: Ipratropium q6h and albuterol q6h prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, a 75-year-old male with COPD, hypertension, and hepatitis C, was transferred to the ICU from the cardiac cath lab due to high-risk cardiac conditions. He has significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery and is awaiting CABG surgery. The patient has a history of incarceration and is estranged from his family. He has no known allergies to statins, morphine, citalopram, thiazides, or antibiotics.

Physically, the patient is responding to stimuli, but his peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic examinations are not assessable. He has a normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is 93% and his blood glucose level is 103 mg/dL.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 167 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 103 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.8/61.9/1.1, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL

Imaging studies show:

* Echo: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Possible mild regional dysfunction of basal inferior and inferolateral wall. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Dilated thoracic aorta.

The patient is currently on the following medications:

* Heparin gtt
* Aspirin 325 mg daily
* Metoprolol 25 mg daily
* Enalapril 10 mg daily
* Diltiazem 120 mg daily
* Terazosin 2 mg daily
* Fluoxetine 20 mg daily
* Trazodone 150 mg qhs
* Omeprazole (home)
* Reglan (home)
* Ipratropium q6h and albuterol q6h prn (nebs)

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has significant stenosis of his left main coronary artery and is awaiting CABG surgery. He is at high risk for additional cardiac events.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has COPD and was treated for a community-acquired pneumonia. He may experience respiratory symptoms and require close monitoring.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and has a history of bleeding.
4. Infection complications: The patient has a history of incarceration and is at risk for infections.
5. Wound healing complications: The patient is scheduled for CABG surgery and may experience wound healing issues.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his medications and treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
