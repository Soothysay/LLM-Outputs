 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with chest pain and was found to have left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient experienced an episode of chest pain today, which resolved with nitroglycerin, but has no electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. He is currently asymptomatic and has been taken off the nitroglycerin drip.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his temperature is 36.4°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 171 x 10^9/L. His creatinine is 1.3 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 24 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. He is currently taking aspirin, tricor, pravastatin, lisinopril, and metformin.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing aspirin, stopping the nitroglycerin drip, and starting heparin. He will also undergo a coronary angiogram and possible CABG surgery. He will be monitored for signs of acute heart failure, and his insulin dose will be adjusted as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's history of CAD and recent episode of chest pain increase his risk of developing ACS.
2. Heart failure: The patient's low ejection fraction and history of hypertension increase his risk of developing heart failure.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's use of insulin and metformin increases his risk of developing hypoglycemia.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may worsen his symptoms if not properly managed.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's use of heparin increases his risk of developing DVT.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's use of heparin increases his risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
8. Infection: The patient's history of diabetes and heart disease increases his risk of developing infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his medical conditions to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   -          Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   -          Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD. He presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG. The patient had an episode of chest pain without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved with nitroglycerin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.2°C, Tcurrent of 36.4°C, HR of 63 bpm, BP of 97/48 mmHg, RR of 21 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 97%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a normal sinus rhythm, and his fluid balance is stable.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of acute heart failure, but he has very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. He is receiving heparin drips and is awaiting CABG.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, platelet count of 171, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 117 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include aspirin, heparin, tricor, pravastatin, lisinopril, and Vitamin D. He is awaiting CABG and will have a plan for endoscopic surgery on Monday.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute heart failure: Given the patient's history of CAD and LMCA disease, there is a risk of acute heart failure, especially if the patient experiences another episode of chest pain or develops hypotension.
2. Chronic heart failure: The patient's low activity level and history of CAD suggest that he may have chronic heart failure, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, ascites, and worsening of his cardiovascular condition.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and the use of antibiotics.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and the use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy may require close monitoring to ensure that his thyroid function remains stable.
6. Insulin resistance: The patient's history of DM2 and the use of insulin may lead to insulin resistance, which can worsen his cardiovascular condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of HTN and the use of antihypertensive medications may require close monitoring to ensure that his blood pressure remains stable.
8. Kidney injury: The patient's use of nephrotoxic medications and the presence of CAD may increase his risk of kidney injury.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring to prevent potential complications and to ensure that he receives optimal care for his cardiovascular condition."

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   -          Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   -          Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and a strong family history of CAD. He presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease, awaiting CABG. He had an episode of chest pain without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved with nitroglycerin. He is currently asymptomatic and on heparin gtt, tricor, pravastatin, and lisinopril.

Physical Examination:

The patient is oriented, with no signs of acute heart failure. He has a soft, non-tender abdomen, and his extremities have no signs of edema or cyanosis. His skin is normal, with no stasis dermatitis or ulcers.

Lab Results:

* WBC: 6.6
* Hct: 37.6
* Plt: 171
* Cr: 1.1
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Ca++: 10.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.2 mg/dL
* PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/35.3/1.1

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain episode, despite being asymptomatic, suggests a high risk of ACS. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is essential.
2. Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's low activity level and potential chronic heart failure may increase his risk of CHF. Monitoring of his cardiac status and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Insulin Dose Adjustment: The patient's DM2 requires close monitoring of his insulin dose, as his last A1C was above goal. Adjusting his insulin dose may be necessary to improve glycemic control.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require further evaluation and treatment, particularly with his diaphoresis and heat intolerance.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's risk of GIB is low, but prophylaxis with Colace/Senna may still be necessary.
6. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's risk of VTE is high due to his immobility and history of CAD. Close monitoring of his VTE risk is essential.
7. Infection: The patient's risk of infection is high due to his immobility and potential chronic heart failure. Close monitoring of his infection risk is essential.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, with frequent checks of his vital signs and cardiac enzymes.
2. Adjust his insulin dose as necessary to improve glycemic control.
3. Continue prophylaxis with Colace/Senna for GIB and VTE.
4. Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's degenerative disc disease in his cervical spine.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and take necessary precautions to prevent infection."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a trans-thoracic echo done at 2:30 PM on the same day. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and has received heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/48 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 171 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose level is 17 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, which increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring of the patient's coagulation profile and platelet count is essential.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. The patient's temperature is stable, but it is essential to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased respiratory rate.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid, which increases the risk of fluid overload. Monitoring of the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is low, indicating hypoglycemia. The patient's glycemic control should be closely monitored to prevent further hypoglycemia.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, are slightly abnormal. Monitoring of these levels is essential to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, indicating mild respiratory distress. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation is essential.
7. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, but monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is essential to prevent cardiac arrhythmia.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and temperature increase the risk of sepsis. Monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.
9. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and heparin sodium infusion. Monitoring of the patient's lower extremities and prophylactic measures should be implemented.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer due to ICU admission and medication. Monitoring of the patient's gastrointestinal status and prophylactic measures should be implemented."

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Continue Nitroglycerin gtt with target SBP <140 mmHg and pain free
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - Continue pravastatin 20 mg Daily, but will discuss with pharmacy
   interactions with Tri-Cor and niacin of lipitor given his severe CAD
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - will obtain CXR, UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Starting Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn
   .
   #. Degenerative disc disease in cervical spine - Pt on percocet for
   pain control. Anesthesia should be aware, given possible cervica
   abnromalities at time of intubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO tonight for possible IABPC in case CP, aCHF or unstability.
   Will monitor electrolytes, Cr.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin subQ; Low risk for GIB (no prophylaxis needed),
   Colace/Senna.
   .
   # CODE: Full code.

   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Continue Nitroglycerin gtt with target SBP <140 mmHg and pain free
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - Continue pravastatin 20 mg Daily, but will discuss with pharmacy
   interactions with Tri-Cor and niacin of lipitor given his severe CAD
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - will obtain CXR, UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Starting Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn
   .
   #. Degenerative disc disease in cervical spine - Pt on percocet for
   pain control. Anesthesia should be aware, given possible cervica
   abnromalities at time of intubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO tonight for possible IABPC in case CP, aCHF or unstability.
   Will monitor electrolytes, Cr.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG. He had a episode of CP today and was transferred to CV-ICU for monitoring. His current vital signs are: T 97.6, BP 121/72, HR 45, RR 16, O2 sat 95%. He is on various medications including heparin, aspirin, nitroglycerin, pravastatin, lisinopril, and insulin. His lab results show a WBC count of 6.6, Hct of 37.6, Plt of 171, Cr of 1.1, and Glucose of 117 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD, LMCA disease, and awaiting CABG surgery increases his risk of cardiovascular complications such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of respiratory complications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of HTN and DM2 increases his risk of neurological complications such as stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
4. Infection: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infections (UTIs) and skin infections.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of gastrointestinal complications such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pancreatitis.
6. Endocrine Complications: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of endocrine complications such as hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of osteoporosis, particularly vertebral compression fractures.
8. Cognitive Impairment: The patient's history of DM2 and HTN increases his risk of cognitive impairment, particularly dementia and depression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Continue to administer medications as prescribed.
3. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular complications such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias.
4. Monitor for signs and symptoms of respiratory complications such as cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
5. Monitor for signs and symptoms of neurological complications such as headache, confusion, and weakness.
6. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count.
7. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Monitor for signs and symptoms of endocrine complications such as changes in thyroid function and adrenal function.
9. Monitor for signs and symptoms of osteoporosis such as back pain and vertebral compression fractures.
10. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment such as changes in mental status and depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU for planned CABG surgery. They have a history of penicillin allergy and have been receiving heparin sodium infusions. The patient has been experiencing anxiety and was written for trazodone and ativan at night. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Their lab results show normal ranges for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of creatinine and glucose. The patient has a code status of full code and is planned for CABG surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusions, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications during surgery.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and they are receiving oxygen support. This may increase the risk of respiratory complications during surgery.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is undergoing CABG surgery, which carries a risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's anxiety may increase the risk of neurological complications during surgery.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could complicate their recovery.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation during surgery.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk of developing VTE due to their immobility and the presence of central venous lines.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count may indicate the development of sepsis, which could complicate their recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour post-operative case in the ICU following a planned morning CABG surgery. The patient has been NPO and has been administered trazodone and ativan at night for anxiety.

Physiological parameters:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), Heart rate 72 bpm (normal range), Blood pressure 94/50 mmHg (slightly low), Respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute (normal range), Oxygen saturation 98% (normal range).
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving heparin infusion at 1,600 units per hour.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,321 mL of fluids, with an output of 3,840 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,519 mL.

Physical examination:

* General: The patient is oriented, with a normal mood and affect.
* HEENT: No signs of pallor or cyanosis.
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmurs, lifts, or thrills.
* Pulmonary: Unlabored breathing, no crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi.
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and obese.
* Extremities: No femoral bruits, and the right groin dressing is clean, dry, and intact.

Lab results:

* Complete blood count (CBC): WBC 6.6 K/uL, Hct 37.6%, Plt 171 K/uL.
* Blood chemistry: Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, Glucose 194 mg/dL, Calcium 10.1 mg/dL, Magnesium 2.6 mg/dL, Phosphorus 4.2 mg/dL.
* Coagulation studies: PT 13.3 seconds, PTT 75.9 seconds, INR 1.1.
* Electrolytes: Sodium 140 mEq/L, Potassium 5.0 mEq/L, Chloride 4.8 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications:

* Hypovolemia: The patient's negative fluid balance and low blood pressure may indicate hypovolemia, which could lead to decreased cardiac output and organ dysfunction.
* Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and presence of an indwelling catheter increase the risk of sepsis and infection.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory rate may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to hypoxia and acidosis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's recent CABG surgery increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac tamponade.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent surgery and use of prophylactic medications increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and bleeding.

Based on the patient's clinical status and laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results to prevent and manage potential complications."

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with DM2,
   HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with
   chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease and is awaiting CABG, who
   had CP episode today and is transfered to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspision he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lessions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefir much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Stopped nitro drip yesterday- patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - CXR done yesterday
   - will obtain UA, and TTE prior to procedure
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Getting
   echocardiogram to assess EF.
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   - Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CHEST PAIN
   Mr. [**Known firstname 275**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4964**] [**Known lastname 8175**] is a 60 year-old gentleman with DM2, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with chest
   pain and was found to have LMCA disease, awaiting CABG today, who had
   CP episode and is transferred to CV-ICU for monitoring.
   .
   # CAD: Pt presented with DOE, which can be angina-equivalent and with
   CP, which was very suspicious for CAD. TIMI score: 3, which gives him
   13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or
   severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. Due to
   high suspicion he was sent directly to cardiac cath, which showed LMCA
   and LAD lesions. Given these findings and most importantly in a DM
   patient, he certainly can benefit much more from CABG compared to PCI.
   He was awaiting CABG and had episode of CP without ECG changes while
   hypertensive. It resolved in minutes and with nitroglycerin gtt.
   - Continue Aspirin 325 mg Daily
   - Has been off nitro drip - patient asymptomatic
   - Pt on heparin gtt
   - On tricor (home dose) and pravastatin
   - no plavix as patient is awaiting CABG
   - Holding BB for now, but will start as needed for target HR of 50-70
   BPM
   - Pt on lisinopril 10 mg daily
   - plan for CABG endoscopic on Monday
   - preop cxr and UA wnl
   - TTE prior to procedure showed mild symmetric LVH with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic
   regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
   - monitor on tele
   - Started on Vitamin D 1200 IU per day for decreasing cardiovascular
   risk
   .
   # Pump - No signs of acute heart failure at the time, but patient has
   very low activity suggesting chronic heart failure. Echo findings as
   above (preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function).
   - Pt on pravastatin, lisinopril; not on beta-blocker
   - Re-start BB after surgery
   .
   # DM Type II with large insulin dose. Last A1C above goal. Will give
   insulin according to home dose. Hold metformin because of dye load. [**Month (only) 8**]
   need to increase basal insulin dose.
   - ISS
   .
   # HTN: Given bradycardia, will not add Beta-blocker. Will continue home
   lisinopril.
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Continue Tricor, niacin. Will change to atorvastatin in
   setting of ACS as above.  Normal LFTs.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose.
   - check TSH given diaphoresis/ heat intolerance.
   .
   # Neck/back pain: Percocet prn.
   .
   # Depression: Continue sertraline.
   .
   # Insomnia: Ambien prn
   .
   # Anxiety: Lorazepam prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, and strong family history of CAD who presented with chest pain and was found to have LMCA disease, awaiting CABG. He had a CP episode without ECG changes while hypertensive, which resolved with nitroglycerin gtt. He is currently on heparin gtt, tricor (home dose), and pravastatin, and is awaiting CABG.

Physically, the patient is oriented x3, with a normal affect and no signs of distress. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, and SpO2 of 98%. His cardiac exam is normal, with no murmurs or gallops.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.6
* Hct: 37.6
* Plt: 171
* Cr: 1.1
* Glucose: 194
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.3/75.9/1.1, Ca++: 10.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 4.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan is to continue aspirin 325 mg daily, hold metformin due to dye load, and restart beta-blocker after surgery. He will also continue his home medications, including pravastatin, lisinopril, and tricor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Acute heart failure
	+ Cardiac arrhythmias
	+ Myocardial infarction
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Pneumonia
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Neurological complications:
	+ Stroke
	+ Seizures
* Infection complications:
	+ Sepsis
	+ Wound infection
* Hemorrhagic complications:
	+ Bleeding complications from heparin or other anticoagulants
* Metabolic complications:
	+ Hyperglycemia
	+ Hypoglycemia
* Other complications:
	+ Renal failure
	+ Hepatic failure
	+ Anemia

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat them effectively."
