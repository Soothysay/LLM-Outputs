You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of CAD, stent placement, and AFib not on coumadin. She has lung nodules suspected to be lung cancer, and was previously hospitalized for PNA and started on avalox. She was transferred to the current hospital due to HOTN and hypoxemia, and was treated with cefepime, vancomycin, lasix, and medrol.

The patient's current condition is critical, with respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and CHF exacerbation. She has a history of NSTEMI and is currently on heparin. Her creatinine has increased from baseline, which may be related to CHF.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 125/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: not assessed

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 18.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 25.0%
* Platelet count: 319 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL
* Glucose: 200 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.9/29.9/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 489/22/1.39, ALT/AST: 52/65, Alk Phos/T Bili: 173/0.6, Differential-Neuts: 92.0%, Lymph: 4.7%, Mono: 3.2%, Eos: 0.0%, LDH: 344 IU/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 4.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* CXR: RLL infiltrate, PVC, and bilateral effusions

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and CHF exacerbation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to AFib and NSTEMI
* Renal failure due to increased creatinine and CHF
* Infection due to PNA and lung nodules
* Delirium and agitation due to medications and underlying medical conditions
* VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation

The patient's plan includes:

* Lasix to control CHF
* Beta-blocker to control heart rate
* Continued heparin for NSTEMI
* Vancomycin and zosyn for RLL infiltrate with increased WBC
* Haldol as needed for agitation
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies."

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Continue lasix
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   Heparin gtt d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increased oxygen requirements and bilateral crackles on chest exam. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.30, which may indicate respiratory acidosis.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating potential myocardial damage. The patient's EKG shows no acute ischemic changes, but the patient's cardiac history and recent DES placement increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient has received IV fluids and diuretics. The patient's urine output is decreased, and the patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be related to volume depletion or inadequate replacement of fluids.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and the patient has received blood transfusions. The patient's stool is guaiac-positive, indicating bleeding.
6. Hypertension/relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and the patient has received antihypertensive medications.
7. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of Strep bovis bacteremia, and the patient's current antibiotic regimen may not be adequate to cover all potential pathogens.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac history and recent DES placement increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, and the patient's blood pressure is labile.

Given these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the patient should receive oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's cardiac enzymes should be closely monitored to assess for further myocardial damage. The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and the patient should receive diuretic therapy as needed to manage fluid overload. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, and the patient should receive electrolyte replacement therapy as needed. The patient's anemia should be managed with blood transfusions as needed, and the patient's bleeding should be managed with anticoagulation therapy as needed. The patient's hypertension/relative hypotension should be managed with antihypertensive medications, and the patient's infectious complications should be managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Continue lasix
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   Heparin gtt d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today,
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent drug-eluting stent placement, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and acute heart failure exacerbation. She has a diagnosis of healthcare-associated pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and is suspected to have lung cancer.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: Hypoxic respiratory distress, likely multifactorial, with concern for pulmonary embolism and lung cancer.
* Cardiac: Elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to demand ischemia, with preserved global systolic function on echocardiogram.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury, likely prerenal, with hyponatremia and anemia.
* Neurological: Acute mental status changes, likely due to hypoxia, infection, and electrolyte imbalances.
* Hematological: Anemia, likely due to bleeding and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's healthcare-associated pneumonia may progress, leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's acute mental status changes may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, delirium, and cognitive decline.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and acute kidney injury may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hyponatremia and anemia may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia.
7. Infection progression: The patient's suspected lung cancer may progress, leading to increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
8. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's suspected pulmonary embolism may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. Monitor cardiac enzymes and adjust therapy accordingly.
3. Continue diuretics for acute heart failure exacerbation.
4. Monitor renal function and adjust therapy accordingly.
5. Continue anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation.
6. Monitor electrolyte imbalances and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Continue antiretroviral therapy for suspected lung cancer.
8. Monitor for signs of bleeding complications and adjust therapy accordingly.
9. Consider bronchoscopic evaluation for suspected lung cancer.
10. Consider PET scan for suspected lung cancer."

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of diltiazem 20 mg IV for a
   fib with RVR. Overnight given lasix 40 mg IV x 2 with 1 L net negative
   overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover Healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Continue lasix
   - ECHO
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   - b/l LENIs negative
   - start heparin gtt for ?PE
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well. Troponin peaked at
   1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.  No acute ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   - continue heparin gtt
   - ECHO showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia and baseline dementia.  Not hypercarbic on ABG.  Pt also
   has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic deficits on exam.
   Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain given no acute
   intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though there was no
   follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia consistent
   with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with infection,
   electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - bcxs
   - U/A, UCx
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today,
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - monitor HCT carefully while on heparin gtt
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.
   - ECHO
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well. Troponin peaked at
   1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.  No acute ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   - continue heparin gtt
   - ECHO showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia and baseline dementia.  Not hypercarbic on ABG.  Pt also
   has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic deficits on exam.
   Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain given no acute
   intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though there was no
   follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia consistent
   with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with infection,
   electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well overnight.
   - supplemental O2
   - bcxs
   - U/A, UCx
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn

   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today,
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - monitor HCT carefully while on heparin gtt
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, recent DES placement, and CRI, who was transferred to the ICU from OSH for respiratory distress. She has multiple lung lesions on CT chest, concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia.

Current medical issues include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: likely multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute CHF exacerbation, and possible PE.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: trending up, likely due to NSTEMI or demand ischemia from AFib with RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.
3. Acute MS changes: likely secondary to hypoxia, infection, hyponatremia, and baseline dementia.
4. ARF: likely prerenal, possibly due to concomitant hyponatremia, poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation, or ATN/AIN.
5. Anemia: HCT trending down, likely due to bleeding at admission, and ongoing bleeding.
6. Hyponatremia: likely secondary to volume depletion.
7. HTN/relative hypotension: likely due to volume depletion and possible sepsis/cardiogenic shock.
8. H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: concern for colon cancer.
9. H/o spiculated lung lesion: need bronch bx and PET scan as outpt.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further respiratory distress, including ARDS, and possible need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and possible need for cardiac catheterization or intervention.
3. Neurologic deterioration, including increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and possible need for neurosurgical intervention.
4. Renal dysfunction, including AKI, and possible need for renal replacement therapy.
5. Bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, and possible need for transfusions.
6. Infection, including sepsis, and possible need for antibiotic therapy.
7. Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and possible need for vasopressors.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and address potential complications."

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and low Na at OSH
   and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt also has sig.
   wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although does not carry a
   diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.  Also concern for PE
   given lack of activity and question of cancer (lung, colon).
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, may need CPAP
   - Vanc/zosyn to cover Healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Check BNP
   - ECHO
   - Duresis as tolerated by blood pressure (initially in setting of
   getting diltiazem 20 mg IV)
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   - f/u LENI's for concern of PE as CTA contraindicated given ARF and V/Q
   scan would likely not be helpful given pre-existing lung disease
   (prelim read neg)
   - start heparin gtt for ?PE
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   - start heparin gtt
   - ECHO for WMA
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection, and
   hyponatremia.  Not hypercarbic on ABG.  Pt also has afib off
   anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic deficits on exam.  Less concern
   for possible metastatic cancer to brain given no acute intracranial
   abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though there was no follow-up MRI.  CT
   head did note areas of encephalomalacia consistent with prior infarct,
   which may give patient poor reserve with infection, electrolyte
   imbalances.
   - supplemental O2
   - bcxs
   - U/A, UCx
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   - hold mirtazipine for now and other sedating medications
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  HCT here 28.9 this
   AM, currently 25.0.  No obvious bleeding at this time.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - monitor HCT carefully while on heparin gtt
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Check urine lytes, osms
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  Currently relatively hypotensive.
   Initially dropped pressure to dilt.  Some concern for early sepsis.
   Also may be cardiogenic given elevated troponins.
   - ECHO
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and low Na at OSH
   and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt also has sig.
   wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although does not carry a
   diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.  Also concern for PE
   given lack of activity and question of cancer (lung, colon).
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, may need CPAP
   - Vanc/zosyn to cover Healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Check BNP
   - ECHO
   - Duresis as tolerated by blood pressure (initially in setting of
   getting diltiazem 20 mg IV)
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   - f/u LENI's for concern of PE as CTA contraindicated given ARF and V/Q
   scan would likely not be helpful given pre-existing lung disease
   (prelim read neg)
   - start heparin gtt for ?PE
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  Denies any current chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath
   in [**2197-3-13**] resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the
   mid-LCX and proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   - start heparin gtt
   - ECHO for WMA
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection, and
   hyponatremia.  Not hypercarbic on ABG.  Pt also has afib off
   anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic deficits on exam.  Less concern
   for possible metastatic cancer to brain given no acute intracranial
   abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though there was no follow-up MRI.  CT
   head did note areas of encephalomalacia consistent with prior infarct,
   which may give patient poor reserve with infection, electrolyte
   imbalances.
   - supplemental O2
   - bcxs
   - U/A, UCx
   - MRI when stable
   - haldol prn
   - hold mirtazipine for now and other sedating medications
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure.
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos given abx at OSH
   - transfuse 1 unit for volume
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  HCT here 28.9 this
   AM, currently 25.0.  No obvious bleeding at this time.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   - monitor HCT carefully while on heparin gtt
   - transfuse 1 unit
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Check urine lytes, osms
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  Currently relatively hypotensive.
   Initially dropped pressure to dilt.  Some concern for early sepsis.
   Also may be cardiogenic given elevated troponins.
   - ECHO
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual-essel stent placement, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, likely due to a combination of factors including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure, and possible pulmonary embolism. She also has a history of diabetes, dementia, and smoking.

The patient's current condition is complicated by elevated cardiac enzymes, acute kidney injury, anemia, hyponatremia, hypertension, and relative hypotension. She is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and heparin, and has undergone several interventions, including diuresis and transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to underlying lung disease, pneumonia, and possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and troponins suggest ongoing cardiac injury, which may lead to further complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine is 2.1, and her current creatinine is 3.2, indicating worsening kidney function. This may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and fluid overload.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, blood loss, or inadequate transfusion support.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to further complications, such as seizures, coma, or even death.
6. Hypertension/relative hypotension: The patient's hypertension and relative hypotension may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure, renal failure, or even cerebral edema.
7. Infection: The patient's history of healthcare-associated pneumonia and possible pulmonary embolism increases her risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
8. Cancer progression: The patient's history of lung lesions and possible colon cancer increases her risk of cancer progression and metastasis.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition, including ongoing assessment of her respiratory, cardiac, and renal function, as well as careful management of her medications and fluids."

   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and

   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]

   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG. Heparin gtt
   d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE thought to be likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - Infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs on arrival to ICU for volume
   replacement [**5-23**]. Crit stable (28.1) today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

   Disposition: ICU until improvement of respiratory status<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, recent drug-eluting stent placement, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, and lung lesions suspicious for lung cancer. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows irregular rhythms.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including troponin and creatine kinase (CK), which may indicate myocardial infarction or demand ischemia. Her white blood cell count is elevated, which may suggest an underlying infection.

The patient has a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and is currently receiving diuretic therapy. Her urine output is adequate, and her serum creatinine level is stable.

The patient's neurologic examination is notable for confusion and disorientation, which may be secondary to hypoxia, infection, hyponatremia, baseline dementia, or poor sleep. She has a history of depression and is currently receiving antidepressant medication.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with supplemental oxygen therapy and bronchodilators as needed. Her chest radiograph shows pulmonary edema, which may be secondary to acute heart failure exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, recent stent placement, and elevated cardiac enzymes may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxic respiratory failure may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be secondary to hypoxia, infection, hyponatremia, baseline dementia, or poor sleep. She may be at risk for neurologic complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
4. Renal complications: The patient's history of AKI and ongoing diuretic therapy may increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of recent antibiotic exposure may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of bleeding at admission and ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.

In conclusion, this patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical conditions, including cardiac, respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   .
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   .
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG. Heparin gtt
   d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE thought to be likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   .
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   .
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs for volume replacement [**5-23**]. Crit
   28.1 today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   .
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   .
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   .
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   .
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has hypoxic respiratory distress, which is likely multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Supplemental oxygen and diuresis may be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient has elevated troponin and CK levels, which may indicate a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia. The patient's cardiac history, including a recent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and placement of drug-eluting stents, may contribute to this condition.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2.1, which has increased to 3.2. The patient's AKI is likely prerenal, given the concomitant hyponatremia that responded to intravenous fluids and the patient's poor forward flow due to heart failure exacerbation.
4. Anemia: The patient has a declining hemoglobin level, which may be related to bleeding, particularly given the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has responded to intravenous fluids, which suggests that the hyponatremia is likely secondary to volume depletion.
6. Hypertension/relative hypotension: The patient has hypertension, which is managed with metoprolol, and relative hypotension, which may be related to the patient's heart failure exacerbation and cardiac medications.
7. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus bovis bacteremia, which may indicate a possible colon cancer.
8. Cancer: The patient has a spiculated lung lesion and a history of adenocarcinoma, which may indicate a possible lung cancer.
9. Neurologic changes: The patient has acute mental status changes, which may be related to hypoxia, infection, hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CHF, and NSTEMI, admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and acute on chronic diastolic CHF. She has improved with diuresis and delirium has improved with remeron and haldol. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 89%. She has a history of allergies, including no known drug allergies. She is receiving various medications, including heparin, pantoprazole, lopressor, and plavix. Her labs show evidence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and chronic renal failure. She has a history of respiratory failure, including pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia, and is receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema pose a significant risk for further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia requires continued treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and the risk of further aspiration remains.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure increases her risk for further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia requires close monitoring to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium requires continued treatment with haldol to prevent further episodes.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and NSTEMI increases her risk for further cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Infection: The patient's aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure increase her risk for further infections, including sepsis.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's respiratory failure and chronic renal failure may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure and chronic renal failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   1.  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite diuresis and
   antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved wince admission to
   the ICU. Overnight needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia. Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history
   (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Some

   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   3.  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given two nights ago. In last two night
   has received mirtazapine for assistance with sleep. In last two days,
   the patient has been lethargic. Overnight had mild hypercarbia to 57.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite diuresis and
   antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved wince admission to
   the ICU. Overnight needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia. Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, recent DES, CRI, and dementia, who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for respiratory distress. She has a diagnosis of acute heart failure, pneumonia, and possible lung cancer. She was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia and was given Lasix for diuresis. She was also started on BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. Her cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and her neurological status is confused but interactive.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, with a peak troponin level of 1.39 ng/mL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 139 mmol/L. Her complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 18.3 x 10^9/L and a platelet count of 72 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, recent DES, CRI, and dementia. She has a history of smoking and has been diagnosed with DM2 and lung cancer.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission to the ICU, and she may require continued supplemental oxygen.
2. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes may indicate ongoing cardiac damage, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 2.1 mg/dL, and her potassium level is 4.3 mmol/L. She may be at risk for acute kidney injury, particularly if she continues to receive nephrotoxic medications.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for anemia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 139 mmol/L, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for hyponatremia.
6. HTN/relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 116/35 mmHg, and she may be at risk for HTN/relative hypotension.
7. H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: The patient has a history of Strep bovis bacteremia, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
8. H/o spiculated lung lesion: The patient has a history of a spiculated lung lesion, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition."

   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Some
   wheezing on exam this AM. Will consider that the lack of improvement
   could be attributed to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Will initiate
   steroids. Question of aspiration as she has been more somnolent
   recently.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one to two
   liter fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels less than 15. Was 22.5
   this AM and will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Initiate prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation
   - Hold meals while somnolent and consider speech and swallow evaluation
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last two days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given two nights ago. In last two night
   has received mirtazapine for assistance with sleep. In last two days,
   the patient has been lethargic. Overnight had mild hypercarbia to 57
   which corrected with BiPAP ventiliation. Infectious work-up show
   negative urine and blood cultures thus far.
   - Hold mirtazapine for now
   - BiPAP again overnight if evening ABG shows ongoing hypercarbia
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon

   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU until improvement of respiratory status<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual-essel stenting, chronic renal insufficiency, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and acute heart failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and diuresis, but her hypoxia has not significantly improved. She has a history of smoking (100 pack-years) and has wheezing on examination, which may indicate an unrecognized COPD exacerbation.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a peak troponin level of 1.39. The echocardiogram showed pulmonary vasculature overload with pulmonary artery hypertension, but could not rule out focal left ventricular wall motion abnormality. The patient has been on heparin for presumed NSTEMI, but this has been discontinued.

The patient's mental status has been changing, with initial agitation requiring haloperidol, followed by lethargy. She has received mirtazapine for sleep assistance, but this will be held for now.

The patient has chronic renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of 2.1. Her creatinine level has been stable, and she has been trending towards diuresis.

The patient has anemia, which has been stable without transfusion need. Her stools have been guaiac negative.

The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol for atrial fibrillation. Her blood pressure is stable, and she is not hypotensive.

The patient has a history of Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and a spiculated lung lesion, which requires further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and pulmonary vasculature overload may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's negative urine and blood cultures may indicate a lack of infection, but the patient's history of bacteremia and lung lesions requires continued monitoring for infection.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of colon cancer and anemia may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's changing mental status and history of dementia may indicate neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Renal complications: The patient's chronic renal failure and diuresis may lead to renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend continued close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status. The patient's medication regimen should be continued, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of infection, bleeding, or neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient has been started on various medications, including Mirtazapine, Lasix, and Heparin, and has undergone various diagnostic tests. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 116/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has been started on antibiotics, which may indicate the presence of sepsis. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient has a central line and urinary catheter, which can increase the risk of infection. Infection can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Bleeding can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient has a history of kidney disease and is receiving diuretics, which can increase the risk of renal failure. Renal failure can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is altered, which can indicate potential neurological deterioration. Neurological deterioration can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can increase the risk of further bleeding. Gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline
   Cr 2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and demetia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring NRB.
   1.  Hypoxic respiratory distress:  This is likely multifactorial
   including healthcare associated pneumonia given leukocytosis (though in
   setting of steroids) and cough and acute dCHF exacerabation (CXR c/w
   pulm edema, BNP > 70,000, esp. given IVF hydration for elevated Cr and
   low Na at OSH and 2-3 units of PRBCs, episodes of afib with RVR).  Pt
   also has sig. wheezing on exam but not hypercarbic on ABG.  Although
   does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking history.
   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]
   resulting in placement of a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LCX and
   proximal OM.  No evidence of re-instent thrombosis on EKG. Heparin gtt
   d/c
d [**5-23**] as elevated CE thought to be likely secondary to demand
   ischemia. Troponin peaked at 1.39 on [**5-23**], now trending down to 1.09.
   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain
   given no acute intracranial abnormality on CT head from [**4-28**] though
   there was no follow-up MRI.  CT head did note areas of encephalomalacia
   consistent with prior infarct, which may give patient poor reserve with
   infection, electrolyte imbalances. Given home remeron and slept well
   overnight.
   - continue supplemental O2 to avoid hypoxia
   - Infectious work up shows BCx and UCx NTD
   - Continue remeron
   - haldol prn
   - ? MRI when stable
   4.  ARF:  Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Most
   likely prerenal given concomitent hyponatremia that responded to IVFs
   and component of poor forward flow for CHF exacerbation.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   ATN as was hypotensive, or AIN given abx exposure. Stable.
   - Urine eos negative.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   5.  Anemia:  HCT at OSH has been trending down 31.1->28.5->22.3.  Pt
   received 2-3 units of PRBCs, OSH records unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 83**] obvious bleeding
   at admission.  Given 1 unit PRBCs on arrival to ICU for volume
   replacement [**5-23**]. Crit stable (28.1) today.
   - guaiac stools
   - typed and crossed
   6.  Hyponatremia:  Na has responded to IVFs at OSH.  Likely secondary
   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   8.  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia: Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some
   concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   9.  H/o spiculated lung lesion: Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for
   3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

   Also concern for PE given lack of activity and question of cancer
   (lung, colon), however bilateral LENIs negative. Diuresis initially
   held secondary to hypotension in setting of patient receiving diltiazem
   20 mg IV on the floor for a fib with RVR. On [**5-23**] given lasix 40 mg IV
   x 2 with 1 L net negative overnight.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to wean as tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix
   - Vanc/zosyn x7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia
   - Echo showed preserved global systolic function with mod pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension
   - Standing nebulizers q4 for COPD exacerbation, start IV steroids if
   becomes more hypercarbic (will avoid clouding MS for now), also would
   consider decreasing BB in favor for CCB (responsive) but likely needs
   it given extensive cardiac history
   2.  Elevated cardiac enzymes:  NSTEMI v. demand ischemic from afib with
   RVR/acute CHF exacerbation.  Trending up at OSH (TropT<0.010, CK 134,
   CKMB 4.4, RI 3.3-->TropT 0.032) and here as well.  No acute ischemic
   changes on EKG.  No chest pain.  Pt had a cardiac cath in [**2197-3-13**]

   - full dose ASA, cont. plavix
   - cont. statin, BB
   3.  Acute MS changes:  Likely secondary to hypoxia, infection,
   hyponatremia, baseline dementia, and poor sleep.  Not hypercarbic on
   ABG.  Pt also has afib off anticoagulation.  No gross neurologic
   deficits on exam.  Less concern for possible metastatic cancer to brain

   to volume depletion.  No overt volume overload outside of pulm
   edema.
   - Na 139 today.
   7.  HTN/relative hypotension:  On admission to ICU relatively
   hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic
   less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - cont. metoprolol for afib
   - hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur

   Disposition: ICU until improvement of respiratory status<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory distress, which is likely multifactorial, including healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure, and possible pulmonary embolism. Supplemental oxygen and diuresis with Lasix may be necessary to improve oxygenation and reduce fluid overload.
2. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: The patient's troponin levels are trending upward, indicating possible NSTEMI or demand ischemia. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization or echocardiography may be necessary to rule out acute coronary syndrome.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 2.1, and OSH admission creatinine was 2.0. The patient is at risk for AKI due to hypotension, dehydration, and potential nephrotoxic medications. Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending downward, indicating anemia. Further evaluation with gastrointestinal bleeding or occult blood loss is necessary to determine the cause of anemia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have responded to IV fluids, indicating possible volume depletion. Further evaluation with fluid balance and electrolyte monitoring is necessary to ensure adequate hydration and electrolyte management.
6. Hypertension/Relative Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but relative hypotension was noted on admission. Further evaluation with medication adjustments and fluid management is necessary to ensure adequate blood pressure control.
7. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. Further evaluation with cultures and antibiotics may be necessary to determine the cause of infection.
8. Dementia: The patient's dementia is likely exacerbating their respiratory distress and delirium. Further evaluation with medication adjustments and non-pharmacological interventions is necessary to improve cognitive function.
9. Cancer: The patient's lung lesions are concerning for lung cancer, and further evaluation with bronchoscopy and PET scan is necessary to determine the extent of disease.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating possible coagulopathy. Further evaluation with platelet transfusions and coagulation studies may be necessary to determine the cause of coagulopathy.

The patient's ICU care plan should include:

* Supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation between 88-94%
* Diuresis with Lasix to reduce fluid overload
* Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins to prevent AKI
* Antibiotics to cover healthcare-associated pneumonia and possible infection
* Medication adjustments to control hypertension and relative hypotension
* Non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive function and reduce delirium
* Further evaluation with bronchoscopy and PET scan to determine the extent of lung cancer
* Coagulation studies and platelet transfusions as necessary to determine the cause of coagulopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, recent stent placement, and presenting with hypoxemia and delirium. She has been treated with bipap overnight and responded well.

The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, with wheezing and expiratory wheezes, which is likely exacerbated by her 100 pack year tobacco history. She has been started on steroids for COPD and will continue to receive nebs.

She also has pulmonary edema due to acute on chronic diastolic CHF, which has been treated with aggressive diuresis. She has been diagnosed with PNA and will continue to receive antibiotics.

The patient's drowsiness has been attributed to her remeron medication, which will be held.

The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, COPD, and PNA. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's PNA may progress, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening infections.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or heart failure exacerbation.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and the presence of central venous lines.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her mechanical ventilation and the presence of endotracheal tubes.
6. Sepsis: The patient's PNA and pulmonary edema may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
7. Worsening of COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen due to her respiratory distress and hypoxemia, leading to further respiratory complications.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's glycemic control may be compromised due to her critical illness, leading to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Will
   consider that the lack of improvement could be attributed to an
   unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Initiated steroids yesterday with mild
   improvement in oxygen sats overnight. Question of aspiration yesterday;
   however, tolerate regular diet with intact mental status, so this does
   not seem to be as concerning unless aspiration is silent.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one liter
   fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Continue prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation (ending on [**5-29**])
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last three days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given on night following admission.
   Received BiPAP on night of [**5-24**] indicated for mild hypercarbia and
   hypoxia at night. Had been lethargic yesterday morning and was going to
   hold mirtazapine; however, patient became agitated at night and
   mirtazapine was given. Patient calm and conversant this morning after a
   quiet night.
   - Restart mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon
   admission here and has been stable. Was 2.8 this AM. BUN has been
   trending down and was 68 this AM.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   #  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia:
   Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   #  H/o spiculated lung lesion:
   Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for 3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, recent dual-essel stenting, and chronic renal insufficiency, who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for respiratory distress. She has a diagnosis of acute heart failure, and her lung lesions on CT chest are concerning for lung cancer. She is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for suspected pneumonia, and also has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and dementia.

The patient's condition has not significantly improved since admission to the ICU, with ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature overload and pulmonary artery hypertension. She has been treated with diuresis and antibiotics, but her hypoxia has not improved. She has a significant smoking history, and it is being considered that the lack of improvement could be attributed to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a peak troponin of 1.39, and her ECHO on [**5-23**] could not rule out a focal left ventricular wall motion abnormality. She was originally on a heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI, but this has since been discontinued.

The patient's acute mental status changes include agitation upon presentation to the ICU, which required haloperidol, and she was given mirtazapine last night. Her current mental status is calm and conversant.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and chronic renal insufficiency, with a baseline creatinine of 2.1.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia has not improved despite treatment, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and pulmonary vasculature overload increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and recent diuresis may increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of renal function.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent hospitalization increase the risk of infection, including healthcare-associated pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and recent diuresis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, recent dual-essel stenting, and pulmonary vasculature overload increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or tachycardia.
7. Delirium: The patient's acute mental status changes and recent hospitalization increase the risk of delirium.
8. Aspiration: The patient's history of smoking and recent hospitalization increase the risk of aspiration.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch-tall individual with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They have been admitted to the ICU for 24 hours and have been receiving treatment for atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and dyspnea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/87 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula and face tent. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula and face tent.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including lasix, heparin sodium, and vancomycin. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 12.5 K/uL, and their platelet count is 269 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and atrial fibrillation increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status increase the risk of sepsis. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, which may be a sign of sepsis.
3. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's risk of VTE is increased due to their atrial fibrillation and hypotension. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent VTE.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status increase the risk of stress ulcer. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent stress ulcer.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support increases the risk of VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and the use of proper hygiene practices are necessary to prevent VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypoxia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's liver function tests are slightly elevated, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total fluid intake of 980 mL and a total fluid output of 1,755 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -775 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula and face tent, with an ABG result of 7.46/52/57/34/10. The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to assess peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac injury or failure, which can lead to further complications such as cardiogenic shock.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and altered mental status may indicate sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and death.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's negative fluid balance may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may indicate delirium, which can lead to further complications such as increased risk of falls and pressure ulcers.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance, and to adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo F with CAD s/p CABG and recent DES x2 in [**3-/2197**], CRI (baseline Cr
   2.1), afib not on coumadin, multiple lung lesions on CT chest
   concerning for lung cancer, DM2, and dementia who was transferred from
   OSH for respiratory distress requiring non-rebreather.
   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Will
   consider that the lack of improvement could be attributed to an
   unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Initiated steroids yesterday with mild
   improvement in oxygen sats overnight. Question of aspiration yesterday;
   however, tolerate regular diet with intact mental status, so this does
   not seem to be as concerning unless aspiration is silent.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one liter
   fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Continue prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation (ending on [**5-29**])
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last three days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given on night following admission.
   Received BiPAP on night of [**5-24**] indicated for mild hypercarbia and
   hypoxia at night. Had been lethargic yesterday morning and was going to
   hold mirtazapine; however, patient became agitated at night and
   mirtazapine was given. Patient calm and conversant this morning after a
   quiet night.
   - Restart mirtazapine 7.5 mg QHS
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   #  [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr is 2.1.  OSH admission Cr was at 2.0.  Cr was 2.9 upon
   admission here and has been stable. Was 2.8 this AM. BUN has been
   trending down and was 68 this AM.
   - Continue to trend with diuresis
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels. Was 15.3 this AM and
   will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   #  Anemia:
   Was transfused at OSH prior to admission here; however, HCT has been
   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.
   #  HTN/relative hypotension:
   On admission to ICU relatively hypotensive in setting of diltiazem for
   a fib. Early sepsis/cardiogenic less likely.  BPs now stable.
   - Cont. metoprolol for afib
   - Continue to hold outpatient amlodipine, hydralazine, imdur
   #  H/o Strep bovis bacteremia:
   Bx of polyp showed adenoma, still some concern re: colon ca.
   - Outpt f/u in 1 month.
   #  H/o spiculated lung lesion:
   Will need bronch bx (once on plavix for 3 mos) and PET scan as outpt.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, recent DES x2, and CRI, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia, but her hypoxia has not significantly improved. She has a significant smoking history (100 pack-years) and is being considered for an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. She has also been diagnosed with acute heart failure and has elevated cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Unrecognized COPD exacerbation: The patient's lack of improvement in oxygen saturation despite treatment for pneumonia may be due to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation.
2. Aspiration: The patient's recent history of smoking and her age may put her at risk for aspiration, which could be exacerbated by her respiratory distress.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent DES x2 may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's history of CRI and her current treatment with vancomycin may increase her risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory distress and her history of smoking may increase her risk for pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of smoking and her age may put her at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or constipation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of dementia and her current treatment with propofol may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Consider adding a bronchodilator to the patient's treatment regimen to help improve her lung function.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust her treatment as needed to manage her cardiac condition.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment as needed to manage her CRI.
5. Consider adding a gastrointestinal prophylaxis medication to the patient's treatment regimen to help prevent gastrointestinal complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her treatment as needed to manage her dementia and potential neurological complications."

   #  Hypoxia:
   Patient came from outside hospital with question of pneumonia and is
   being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for this indication. Also
   presented with BNP >[**Numeric Identifier **] and clinic exam and imaging consistent with
   acute heart failure. ECHO from [**5-23**] was not convincing for systolic
   dysfunction; however, ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature
   overload with pulm artery hypertension. Despite exceptional diuresis
   and antibiotics, hypoxia has not significantly improved since admission
   to the ICU. Overnight on [**5-24**] needed BiPAP for hypercarbia and hypoxia.
   Although does not carry a diagnosis of COPD, she has a sig. smoking
   history (reported as 100 pack-years in recent discharge summary).  Some
   wheezing on exam this AM. Will consider that the lack of improvement
   could be attributed to an unrecognized COPD exacerbation. Will initiate
   steroids. Question of aspiration as she has been more somnolent
   recently.
   - Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%, attempt to liberate as
   tolerated
   - Continue diuresis with furosemide with goal of negative one to two
   liter fluid balance
   - Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare associated pneumonia (ending
   on evening of [**5-28**])
   - Vancomycin being given based on random levels less than 15. Was 22.5
   this AM and will be remeasured tomorrow morning.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN and standing
   - Initiate prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD
   exacerbation
   - Hold meals while somnolent and consider speech and swallow evaluation
   #  Elevated cardiac enzymes:
   Troponin peak to 1.39 and trended down on AM labs on [**5-24**]. ECHO on [**5-23**]
   could not rule out a focal left ventricle wall motion abnormality. Was
   originally on heparin drip for presumed NSTEMI; however, this has since
   been discontinued. No chest pain complaints in last two days.
   - Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes.
   #  Acute MS changes:
   Patient was initially acutely agitated upon presentation to the ICU and
   required haldol with last dose given two nights ago. In last two night
   has received mirtazapine for assistance with sleep. In last two days,
   the patient has been lethargic. Overnight had mild hypercarbia to 57
   which corrected with BiPAP ventiliation. Infectious work-up show
   negative urine and blood cultures thus far.
   - Hold mirtazapine for now
   - BiPAP again overnight if evening ABG shows ongoing hypercarbia
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures

   stable without transfusion need while hospitalized here. Was 29.9 this
   AM. Stools have been guaiac negative.
   - Continue to trend HCT daily.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU until improvement of respiratory status<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of CAD, CABG, and DES, who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for respiratory distress. She has a diagnosis of DM2, dementia, and is being treated for pneumonia and acute heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxia with SpO2 of 97%, requiring supplemental O2, and ABG showing PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 57. She has a history of smoking and some wheezing on exam, which may indicate an unrecognized COPD exacerbation.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, with some concern for pulmonary vasculature overload and pulmonary artery hypertension.
* Renal: Chronic renal failure, with a baseline Cr of 2.1 and currently stable at 3.0.
* Hemodynamic: Relative hypotension, but stable BPs with metoprolol for afib.
* Neurological: Confused but interactive, with some concern for aspiration due to recent somnolence.
* Infectious: Negative urine and blood cultures, but ongoing evidence of pulmonary vasculature overload and pulmonary artery hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying COPD and lung lesions.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and pulmonary vasculature overload may lead to cardiac failure, which could be worsened by her chronic renal failure.
* Infection: The patient's negative urine and blood cultures do not rule out the possibility of infection, which could be exacerbated by her chronic renal failure and immunosuppressive therapy.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of smoking and recent somnolence may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by her chronic renal failure and immunosuppressive therapy.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's confusion and somnolence may worsen, which could be exacerbated by her chronic renal failure and immunosuppressive therapy.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

* Supplemental O2 for goal O2 sats 88-94%
* Continue diuresis with furosemide to achieve a negative fluid balance
* Vanc/zosyn x 7 days to cover healthcare-associated pneumonia
* Initiate prednisone burst 60 mg daily for 5 days to treat for COPD exacerbation
* Hold meals while somnolent and consider speech and swallow evaluation
* Monitor for chest pain or telemetry changes
* Hold mirtazapine for now and consider alternative sedation options
* BiPAP again overnight if evening ABG shows ongoing hypercarbia
* Follow-up pending blood cultures
* Continue to trend with diuresis and monitor Cr levels
* Consider bronch bx and PET scan as outpt."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Oriented to person, place, and time

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.5-11.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 269 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2-2.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.09 ng/mL
* TCO2: 38-40 mmHg
* Glucose: 133-201 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is much improved, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, but she may still be at risk for developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk for bleeding.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is being fed through a nasogastric tube, which may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances if not properly managed.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium is well-controlled with mirtazipine, but she may still be at risk for delirium due to her underlying medical conditions and medications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Wound complications: The patient has a nasogastric tube and may be at risk for wound complications, such as infection or bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU."
