 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   55 yo man with large intracranial hemmorhage - R thalamic,
   intraventricular bleed with midline shift.  It appears that he was down
   at home for some time given the pressure ulcers on his L side.  His
   prognosis is very poor in light of timecourse, severity of bleed, and
   poor neuro exam.  Appreciate neurosurgical and neurology input - agree
   that any neurological intervention at this time would not change the
   outcome for this unfortunate gentleman.
   1. ICH: Cont to monitor BP to keep MAP < 110.  Do not overcorrect
   sodium to quickly.  Keep pCO2 in low 30s if possible
   2. Hypernatremia: Check frequently, correct only slowly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with a large bleed in the right thalamic region, intraventricular bleed, and midline shift. The patient has a poor neuro exam, with no spontaneous movement, no response to noxious stimuli, and no corneal reflexes. He is on invasive ventilation and has a history of encephalopathy. The patient has a range of medical issues, including hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, and potential acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Further bleeding or expansion of the ICH, which could worsen the patient's condition and potentially lead to brain herniation or death.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory failure and potential aspiration of gastric contents.
3. Progression of acute kidney injury (AKI) or development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the patient's potential acute renal failure.
4. Increased risk of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's impaired immune function and potential colonization of the respiratory tract.
5. Potential development of pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to the patient's prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity.
6. Further worsening of the patient's hyperglycemia, which could lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma.
7. Potential development of electrolyte imbalances, such as hypernatremia, which could lead to complications such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's BP to keep MAP < 110 and avoid overcorrecting sodium levels.
2. Check frequently and correct hypernatremia slowly to avoid complications.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed to prevent further worsening of respiratory failure.
4. Trend Hct levels to monitor for GI bleeding and potential acute renal failure.
5. Consider consulting with social work to address goals of care and confirm the patient's identity.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and provide prophylactic measures to prevent further skin breakdown.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to monitor the patient's renal function and potential development of AKI or CKD."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present, and now with
   maroon stool overnight. BUN elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated
   secondary to dehydration. Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown
   past medical history is broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**]
   tear, lower GI bleed, diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's (q6 hr)
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement pending family discussion
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:  ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive and was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis.

The patient's condition has remained stable overnight, with no requirement for pressors. However, the patient is still withdrawing to painful stimuli and is not responding to verbal commands.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, which is a concerning condition that requires close monitoring for signs of herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is 37.2°C, which is slightly below normal. The patient is at risk for hypothermia, which can exacerbate other medical conditions.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has a guaiac-positive stool and is at risk for further bleeding.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 162 mmol/L, which is likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia. The patient requires fluid replacement to correct this condition.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL, which is likely due to rhabdomyolysis and prerenal etiology.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has a rising creatine kinase level, which is likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient has a troponin level of 0.04 ng/mL, which is consistent with a troponin leak.
9. Sacral ulcers: The patient has large eschars on the L back and coccyx, which suggest that the patient was down for several days.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these conditions to prevent further complications. The patient's family should be informed of the patient's condition and the plan of care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Herniation or increased intracranial pressure due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory status due to the patient's underlying respiratory condition.
3. Further bleeding or worsening of GI bleeding.
4. Hypovolemic shock or worsening of hypernatremia.
5. Acute kidney injury or worsening of acute renal failure.
6. Further progression of rhabdomyolysis.
7. Cardiac complications due to the troponin leak.
8. Infection or sepsis due to the patient's sacral ulcers.

The patient's care should be managed in collaboration with the neurology, cardiology, and gastroenterology services to ensure that all medical conditions are adequately managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift. Concerns in the
   setting of IPH include herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
   Neurology and neurosurgery saw the patient in the emergency room and
   did not recommend interventions. Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is
   difficult to interpret.  He had some response to pain yesterday,
   although this morning, off propofol he is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (D5NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive and was brought to the ICU. The patient has a complex set of medical conditions, including:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, which is a concern for herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure, and has an ABG showing 7.31/49/510.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), which is likely due to central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has guaiac-positive stool and is oozing blood, with a differential diagnosis including gastritis, PUD, duodenal tear, lower GI bleed, diverticulosis, and AVM.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 164, which is likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia, with a free water deficit of approximately 7.2L.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has unknown baseline creatinine, and suspect rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, as well as a prerenal etiology.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient had a troponin level of 0.06 at OSH, and EKG does not show evidence of ST changes.
9. Sacral ulcers: The patient has large eschars on L back and coccyx and heel, suggesting that the patient was down for several days.

The patient's medical history is unknown, and the patient's father is unable to provide information. The patient's brother's phone number is still unknown.

The patient's current medications include:

* Insulin
* Propofol
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.6-18.3
* Hct: 41.5-35.0
* Plt: 94
* Cr: 3.7-4.6
* TropT: 0.04-0.03

* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 334 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 3.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret, and the patient is not responding to painful stimuli.
* Keep HOB > 30 degrees, and neuro checks q1 hours.
* Control BP to keep SBP between 120-160, and MAP < 110.
* No antiplatelet agents, and no heparin for 48-72 hours.
* Repeat head CT tomorrow in am.
* Obtain FLP, HgA1c, and trend CEs.
* Tylenol PRN for normothermia.
* Stroke consult service recommendations.
* Decrease FiO2 and wean vent as tolerated.
* Check TSH, blood, and urine cultures.
* Active T+S, PPI, and serial hct's.
* Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues.
* Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established.
* Slowly replace free water (D5NS at 100cc/h) and q4h lytes.
* Send urine lytes and f/u u/o.
* Trend CK and consider surgery c/s for debridement.
* Follow wound care recs.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old individual who was found unresponsive and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). They have been receiving antibiotics, insulin, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/82 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's neurological status is impaired, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death if left untreated.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine kinase levels, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to muscle damage and kidney failure.
4. Ineffective Coping: The patient's impaired neurological status and inability to respond to stimuli may indicate ineffective coping mechanisms, which can lead to further deterioration in their condition.
5. Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient's neurological status and laboratory results suggest a risk of ICH, which can lead to severe complications and death if left untreated.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, which can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and death if left untreated.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown and infection.
8. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if left untreated."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   .
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Preliminary read of CTA of head
   indicated right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline
   shift. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol
   and paralysis with vecuronium.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - Stop propofol to assess neuro status
   - will not continue the dilantin, as dilantin can interfere with
   platelet function
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Frequent ABG's
   - Place a-line
   .
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR huggers
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   .
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (1/2NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Wound care c/s
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Preliminary read of CTA of head
   indicated right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline
   shift. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol
   and paralysis with vecuronium.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - Stop propofol to assess neuro status
   - will not continue the dilantin, as dilantin can interfere with
   platelet function
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Frequent ABG's
   - Place a-line
   .
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR huggers
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   .
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (1/2NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Wound care c/s
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history who was found unresponsive and has been admitted to the ICU. He has multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, and concerns for herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
2. Respiratory failure requiring intubation, with ABG showing 7.31/49/510 and CXR clear.
3. Hypothermia, possibly due to central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency.
4. GI bleeding, with guaiac-positive stool and elevated BUN, likely due to dehydration.
5. Hypernatremia, with Na 164 and free water deficit of approximately 7.2L.
6. Acute renal failure, with unknown baseline creatinine, suspecting rhabdomyolysis and prerenal etiology.
7. Rhabdomyolysis, with CK rising to 800, likely secondary to prolonged period of immobility.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak, with Troponin I of 0.06, but no ST changes on EKG.
9. Sacral ulcers, likely due to prolonged immobility.

Plan:

1. Stop propofol to assess neuro status.
2. Keep HOB > 30 degrees and BP control between 120-160.
3. Repeat head CT tomorrow morning.
4. Obtain FLP, HgA1c, and trend CEs.
5. Tylenol PRN for normothermia.
6. Stroke consult service recommendations.
7. Decrease FiO2 and frequent ABG's.
8. Place a-line.
9. BAIR huggers for hypothermia.
10. Check TSH, blood, and urine cultures.
11. Active T+S and PPI for GI bleeding.
12. Serial hct's and consider GI c/s if GIB continues.
13. Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established.
14. Slowly replace free water and q4h lytes for hypernatremia.
15. Send urine lytes and follow up u/o for acute renal failure.
16. Continue IVF and trend CK for rhabdomyolysis.
17. Trend CE and serial EKG's for NSTEMI/Troponin leak.
18. Wound care c/s for sacral ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation and hydrocephalus due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Vasospasm and stroke due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
3. Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated complications.
4. Hypothermia and infection due to prolonged immobility.
5. GI bleeding and perforation due to prolonged immobility.
6. Hypernatremia and dehydration due to inadequate fluid replacement.
7. Acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia due to rhabdomyolysis and dehydration.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak and cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged immobility.
9. Sacral ulcers and wound infections due to prolonged immobility."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with an intracranial hemorrhage, specifically a large bleed in the right thalamic region with midline shift. His neuro exam is poor, and his level of consciousness is clouded by metabolic derangements. He has a history of withdrawing to pain when propofol is off, and his head CT overnight showed slightly more intraventricular blood but otherwise stable. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory support is being managed. He has a variety of medical conditions, including acute renal failure, hypernatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: Given the patient's large intracranial hemorrhage, there is a risk of increased intracranial pressure, which could lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. Seizures: The patient's poor neuro exam and history of withdrawing to pain when propofol is off suggest a risk of seizures, which could be triggered by the intracranial hemorrhage or other underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory decline if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure is being managed with saline and monitoring, but there is a risk of further kidney injury if the underlying cause is not addressed.
5. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of decubitus ulcers suggest a risk of infection, which could be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypernatremia and rhabdomyolysis suggest a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and impaired skin integrity suggest a risk of further bleeding, which could be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
8. Wound complications: The patient's decubitus ulcers and impaired skin integrity suggest a risk of wound complications, such as infection or further breakdown.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - proctoscopy to evaluate possibility of distal lesion (sugery vs
   proctoscopy)
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   - DDVAP for uremic platelets in setting of bleed and possible procedure
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today.
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 on admission likely due to hypovolemic
   hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167.
   Free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.  Na to 150 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely that
   rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - proctoscopy to evaluate possibility of distal lesion (sugery vs
   proctoscopy)
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   - DDVAP for uremic platelets in setting of bleed and possible procedure
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today.
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 on admission likely due to hypovolemic
   hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167.
   Free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.  Na to 150 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely that
   rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has undergone several interventions, including debridement of sacral ulcers, transfusion of blood products, and adjustment of sodium levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Herniation and hydrocephalus due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which may require urgent neurosurgical intervention.
2. Vasospasm, which may lead to further neurological deterioration.
3. GI bleeding, which may require transfusion of blood products and potentially lead to hemorrhagic shock.
4. Respiratory failure, which may require continued mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Acute kidney injury, which may require further fluid management and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease.
6. Rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to further muscle damage and potentially require dialysis.
7. Infection, which may be related to the GI bleeding, sacral ulcers, or other sources, and may require antibiotic therapy.
8. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypernatremia, which may require careful management to prevent further complications.
9. Cardiovascular instability, which may be related to the patient's underlying conditions and require close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm.
10. Sepsis, which may be related to the patient's underlying infections and require prompt recognition and management.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for further complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his condition, including regular neurological checks, adjustment of sodium levels, and management of his respiratory and cardiovascular status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - Repeat CT head per [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - Transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s
   - GI consult
   - Continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   .
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.   Na to 150 this AM
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a neuro-stroke patient in the ICU who has been experiencing worsening neurological status. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. The patient has been experiencing bright red blood from the flexiseal, which was attributed to GNR in the blood culture. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been undergoing debridement of wounds. The patient's family is still deciding on the goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture shows GNR, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Wound Infection: The patient's wounds are at risk of infection due to the presence of GNR in the blood culture.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or hypotension.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gut is at risk of ischemia due to the presence of GNR in the blood culture, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is worsening, which can increase the risk of neurological complications such as stroke or brain edema.
7. Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy: The patient's blood culture shows GNR, which can lead to sepsis-induced coagulopathy if not treated promptly.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which can increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's blood culture shows GNR, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance if not treated promptly.
10. Metabolic Complications: The patient's blood culture shows GNR, which can lead to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia if not treated promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has:

1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with a large bleed in the right thalamic region and intraventricular bleed with midline shift.
2. Hypernatremia, which is improving with slow rate of free water repletion.
3. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed/Blood Loss Anemia, with a recent episode of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and hemodynamically stable.
4. GNR bacteremia, treated empirically with Zosyn and Vancomycin.
5. Acute Renal Failure, with creatinine trending down.
6. Respiratory Failure, requiring mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.
7. Decubitus ulcers, treated with wound care and debridement.
8. Rhabdomyolysis, with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.
9. Hyperglycemia, with blood glucose levels ranging from 84 to 162 mg/dL.
10. Impaired skin integrity, with possible risk of further skin breakdown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Increased risk of aspiration due to respiratory failure and altered gag reflex.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to GNR bacteremia.
3. Progression of acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Further bleeding or hemorrhage due to ICH or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
6. Development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
7. Increased risk of skin breakdown or infection due to impaired skin integrity.
8. Development of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders due to hypernatremia or hyperglycemia.

The patient's family has not reached consensus on goals of care, with the father and brother having differing opinions. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and midline shift, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He has a history of hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is also positive for GNR bacteria in his blood culture. The patient's family has decided to make him DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and may change goals to Comfort Measures Only (CMO) if he continues to deteriorate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the large ICH and midline shift, which may lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further blood loss, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and even death.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potentially life-threatening infections.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture for GNR bacteria may lead to further sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's immobility and pressure sores may lead to further skin breakdown and potentially life-threatening infections.
8. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's hypernatremia and acute renal failure may lead to further muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's immobility and pressure sores may lead to further skin breakdown and potentially life-threatening infections.
10. Neurological deterioration: The patient's large ICH and midline shift may lead to further neurological deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a significant gastrointestinal bleed, requiring multiple blood transfusions and vasopressor support. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing bleeding, hypotension, and tachycardia. Despite efforts to control the bleeding, the patient has continued to require transfusions and vasopressor support. The patient's respiratory status has also been compromised, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hyperglycemia. The patient's skin integrity is also compromised, with a risk of pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding is a significant risk factor for further complications, including hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, and organ failure.
2. Hypotension and tachycardia: The patient's persistent hypotension and tachycardia may indicate a high risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised respiratory status may lead to further complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and decreased oxygenation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may lead to further complications, including seizures, brain edema, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels may lead to further complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infections.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's compromised skin integrity may lead to further complications, including pressure ulcers, skin infections, and decreased mobility.
7. Intracerebral hemorrhage: The patient's risk of intracerebral hemorrhage is increased due to the patient's ongoing bleeding and compromised coagulation profile.
8. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased due to the patient's compromised muscle function and elevated creatine kinase levels.

These potential complications highlight the need for continued close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday, IR
   felt unable to intervene on clot
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with unknown past medical history who presented to the emergency room after being found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He has undergone several interventions, including tagged RBC scan, IR angio, and transfusion of 4 units of blood. His condition remains unstable, and he is currently intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation. He has a large amount of melena/brb output and has passed a large clot, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a concern for herniation, especially given the presence of hydrocephalus and midline shift.
2. Vasospasm: The patient's bleeding may be exacerbated by vasospasm, which could lead to further hemorrhage and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rising CK levels suggest ongoing rhabdomyolysis, which could lead to acute kidney injury and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's GI bleeding and sacral ulcers may increase his risk of infection, which could be life-threatening.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his mechanical ventilation is not optimized, leading to hypoxia and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage and potential vasospasm may lead to neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and brain death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if his underlying kidney disease is not addressed, leading to chronic kidney disease and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if his free water deficit is not corrected, leading to central pontine myelinolysis and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Optimize his mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Monitor his CK levels closely and consider initiating therapy to prevent further rhabdomyolysis.
4. Consider antibiotics to prevent infection in the setting of GI bleeding and sacral ulcers.
5. Monitor his neurological status closely and consider imaging studies to evaluate for potential vasospasm or other neurological complications.
6. Continue to correct his hypernatremia and monitor his renal function closely to prevent further kidney injury.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to evaluate the patient's neurological status and potential for neurological complications.
8. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to evaluate the patient's renal function and potential for chronic kidney disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with midline shift, intraventricular bleed, and poor neurological exam. He has bacteremia, GNR, and is receiving empiric antibiotics. He has acute respiratory failure, hypernatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and impaired skin integrity. He is also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding and has received 6 units of packed red blood cells. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. He is being treated with insulin, pantoprazole, and other medications. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 145/77 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of bleeding: The patient's ICH and bacteremia may increase his risk of bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as intracranial hemorrhage expansion or bleeding into other organs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory arrest or respiratory failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis may lead to further complications such as kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications such as decubitus ulcers, infection, or sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as hemorrhagic shock or gastrointestinal perforation.
7. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to further complications such as sepsis, endocarditis, or meningitis.
8. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and cardiac disease may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or sudden death.
10. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and impaired immune function may increase his risk of sepsis, which could lead to further complications such as organ failure, respiratory failure, or death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated. His condition is unstable, and he is at risk for herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage is causing midline shift and concern for herniation. Monitoring of his neurologic status and potential interventions such as ventriculostomy may be necessary to prevent this complication.
2. Hydrocephalus: The patient's head CT scan shows hydrocephalus, which may require interventions such as ventriculostomy or shunting to relieve pressure on the brain.
3. Vasospasm: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage may cause vasospasm, which can lead to cerebral infarction or stroke.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding is ongoing, and he may require further interventions such as endoscopy or angiography to control bleeding.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia, and he may require further treatment with free water and electrolyte replacement.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is resolving, but he may require further treatment with dialysis or other interventions to support his renal function.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis is likely secondary to his prolonged period of immobility, and he may require further treatment with IV fluids and other interventions to support his muscle function.
8. Sacral ulcers: The patient's sacral ulcers are likely secondary to his prolonged period of immobility, and he may require further treatment with wound care and debridement.
9. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient's NSTEMI/Troponin leak is likely secondary to his rhabdomyolysis, and he may require further treatment with antiplatelet agents and other interventions to support his cardiac function.
10. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia is likely secondary to his prolonged period of immobility, and he may require further treatment with warming measures and other interventions to support his thermoregulation.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14108**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who was found down with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Herniation: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage is a risk factor for herniation, which can lead to further neurological damage or even death.
2. Hydrocephalus: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage and hydrocephalus can lead to increased intracranial pressure, which can cause further neurological damage or death.
3. Vasospasm: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage can lead to vasospasm, which can cause further neurological damage or death.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, which can cause further organ dysfunction or death.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis can lead to further muscle damage, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular instability.
7. Sacral ulcers: The patient's sacral ulcers can lead to further infection, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.
8. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient's NSTEMI/Troponin leak can lead to further cardiac damage, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular instability.
9. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia can lead to further cardiovascular instability, arrhythmias, and organ dysfunction.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a severe head injury, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He was intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure, but was extubated yesterday. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) and is receiving morphine drip for pain management. His laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis, particularly in the setting of compromised immune function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and is now extubated, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a large skin ulcer on his left arm and is at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient has a severe head injury, which may lead to neurological deterioration if not managed appropriately.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for further infections, particularly in the setting of compromised immune function.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
8. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient has anion-gap acidosis, which may lead to respiratory failure and other complications if not managed appropriately.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for any signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain with morphine drip and consider additional pain management options if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider reintubation if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with supportive care and consider further interventions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further interventions if necessary.
6. Consider further laboratory testing to rule out underlying infections or other complications.
7. Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and anion-gap acidosis closely and consider further interventions if necessary.
8. Consider involving a multidisciplinary team, including infectious disease specialists, nephrologists, and pulmonologists, to manage the patient's complex medical needs."

   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to

   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis.
* The patient is currently on comfort measures only, with a morphine drip and has been made DNR.
* The patient has a large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot yesterday, indicating ongoing GI bleeding.
* The patient has a tagged RBC scan showing sigmoid bleeding and has been transfused with 4 units of blood.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an ABG showing 7.53/18/199/17/-4 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 199.
* The patient has a rising CK level, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis, and is receiving IVF.
* The patient has sacral ulcers on the L back, coccyx, and heel, which are being managed with wound care and antibiotics.
* The patient has a history of NSTEMI/Troponin leak, but this is no longer an active issue.
* The patient's hypothermia is being managed with a Bair hugger and will be re-evaluated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the GI tract, which could lead to further hypovolemia and worsen the patient's renal function.
* Progression of the patient's rhabdomyolysis, which could lead to further muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's ongoing GI bleeding and bacteremia.
* Worsening of the patient's anion-gap acidosis, which could lead to further respiratory compromise.
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, due to the patient's ongoing renal failure and rhabdomyolysis.
* Potential for further bleeding from the sacral ulcers, which could lead to further hypovolemia and worsen the patient's overall condition.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential complications that may arise, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his care to prevent further deterioration and improve his overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The note documents the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical interventions over the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen delivery of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, and the arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.53, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 18 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 199 mmHg.

The patient has received various medications, including morphine sulfate, hydralazine, and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). The patient has also received fluid therapy, including intravenous fluids and blood products.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is within normal limits, but the total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level is slightly low. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and LDH level suggest a potential septic response.
3. Renal failure: The patient's Cr level is within normal limits, but the patient's condition and medication regimen may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's low TCO2 level and elevated lactate level suggest a potential metabolic acidosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential bleeding risk from the patient's condition and medications may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the ICU care plan should focus on maintaining respiratory and hemodynamic stability, managing the patient's pain and discomfort, and preventing or treating potential complications."

   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   Per discussion with family made comfort measures only on Friday [**4-30**].
   # Comfort: patient appears comfortable, was started on morphine
    - continue morphine drip
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  Stable according to last CT scan.
   Extubated yesterday
   - continue to monitor and keep comfortable
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot [**4-29**], transfused total of 4 units, tagged RBC scan
   showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on clot.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue to keep comfortable
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - now extubated, continue to support
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - not pursuing antibiotic therapy d/t CMO
   # Lab Abnormalities:  No longer checking labs.
   -continue supportive care
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - continue wound care, no further antibiotics
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   62 yo man found unresponsive found to have intracranial hemorrhage, GI
   bleed, now CMO.
   Overnight, extubated and placed on morphine drip.
   BP 117/59 P75 Sat 95% on RA, RR 10
   Lying in bed, unresponsive to voice but awake.  Appears comfortable.
   Lungs clear, RRR.
   Agree with plan to transfer to floor with plans for hospice should he
   survive.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. He was found down and unresponsive, and his condition has been deteriorating. The patient was intubated and received antibiotics, but due to his declining condition, comfort measures only (CMO) were initiated. He was extubated yesterday and is now on a morphine drip.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further respiratory support.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has a large amount of melena/brb output and may continue to bleed, potentially leading to hemorrhagic shock.
3. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient's intracranial hemorrhage may continue to expand, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has a GNR bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
6. Sacral Ulcers: The patient's large sacral ulcers may become infected, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
7. NSTEMI/Troponin Leak: Although the patient's troponin leak is attributed to rhabdo, there is still a risk of cardiac complications if not properly managed.
8. Anion-Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications, such as seizures, if not properly managed.
10. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of GNR bacteremia make him susceptible to further infections, which may lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications."
