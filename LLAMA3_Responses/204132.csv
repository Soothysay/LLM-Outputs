   to background brain parenchyma; though the short-interval change argues
   slightly against). Also consider acute hemorrhage (iso T1, hyper T2;
   though
   CT density of only ~ 44, and no corresponding abnormality on GRE argue
   against). Pituitary mass again seen. MRA/MRV: No vascular occlusion or
   sinus

   Study limited by motion (though 5 attempts made). However, impression
   of
   mildly increased density diffusely, interdigitating with sulci,

   near skull base. Given the concern for hemorrhage, and lack of IV
   contrast
   administration, this may represent subarachnoid hemorrhage. MRI had

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Will keep patient intubated for now pending LP.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - blood cultures Uctx to screen for additional sources of infection
   that can cause acute mental status changes
   # Respiratory failure: sputum and consolidation on CXR suggest possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia
   - sent sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime pending ctx data
   #  hypophosphatemia: unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lyes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Will keep patient intubated for now pending LP.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - blood cultures Uctx to screen for additional sources of infection
   that can cause acute mental status changes
   # Respiratory failure: sputum and consolidation on CXR suggest possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia
   - sent sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime pending ctx data
   #  hypophosphatemia: unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lyes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p admission at Hospital1 from 2144-7-11 to 2144-11-12) who was transferred from Hospital6 following an episode of altered mental status early today that led to intubation for airway protection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure not ARDS.
* Altered mental status: severe enough to warrant intubation for airway protection, with possible etiologies including intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.
* Nausea and vomiting: possibly attributed to increased ICH in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS lymphoma.
* Hypophosphatemia: unclear etiology, with possible causes including decreased absorption, increased losses, or hungry bone syndrome.
* Abnormal EKG: diffuse ST and T changes attributed to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities.
* Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-HD methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate, with possible recurrence of lymphoma contributing to altered mental status.
* Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: recent labs showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high FSH and high prolactin.
* Sacral decubitus ulcer: reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection, now appearing without obvious infection.
* Constipation: treated with polyethylene glycol and senna.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Recurrence of lymphoma, leading to further neurological decline or respiratory failure.
* Development of sepsis or secondary infections, particularly in the setting of immunocompromised status.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to systemic anticoagulation and potential underlying coagulopathy.
* Nutritional deficiencies, particularly hypophosphatemia, which may contribute to muscle weakness, fatigue, and respiratory failure.
* Worsening of sacral decubitus ulcer, potentially leading to further complications such as sepsis or osteomyelitis.
* Development of respiratory failure or ARDS due to underlying lung disease or secondary infections.
* Progression of pituitary macroadenoma, potentially leading to further hormonal imbalances and neurological complications.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU, with a focus on addressing the above-mentioned potential complications and optimizing respiratory, neurological, and nutritional support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.

   Assessment and Plan
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Attempt to liberate from sedation overnight to assess patient's
   underlying mental status, then consider extubation if no neurosurg
   involvement
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - CXR, blood cultures, and UA to screen for additional sources of
   infection that can cause acute mental status changes
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - Consider TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

   - Standing polyethylene glycol and senna
   - PRN bisacodyl and lactulose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Patient
s mental status changes severe
   enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Initial concern for
   intracerebral hemorrhage given Head CT report from [**Hospital3 1573**], aniscoria, systemic anticoagulation with enoxaparin, and
   report of acute mental status changes. Possible etiologies of ICH would
   be an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, spontaneous bleed in
   setting of systemic anticoagulation, or unrealized trauma.   STAT head
   CT here (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage
   causing herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.
   Additionally, this presentation could represent a recurrence of his
   lymphoma, which was formerly thought to be in remission. Must consider
   that observed behavior and resulting mental status changes at [**Hospital 9798**] were consistent with a seizure. Is possible that
   patient's serotonergic medications of citalopram, nortriptyline, and
   dilaudid acted to create a serotonin syndrome that presented with
   patient turning head to right due to increased tone. On physical exam
   at this time, muscle tone is essentially normal and patient has no
   history of fevers or clonus at OSH. Must also consider that his
   presentation is related to meningitis or encephalitis, though no
   prodrome of illness aside from nausea and vomiting and no reported
   fevers. As for other infections, should screen with blood culture, UA
   (was seen to have [**6-24**] RBCs and WBCs at OSH), and CXR. No elevation in
   livier enzymes and ammonia of 27 at [**Hospital3 **], both of which are
   inconsistent with a hepatic encephalopathy.
   MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the settind of
   elevated LDH, this could be an indication of recurrent disease. Phos
   decreased dramatically which could have caused a metabolic
   encephaolpathy or precipitated a seizure.
   - Attempt to liberate from sedation overnight to assess patient's
   underlying mental status, then consider extubation if no neurosurg
   involvement
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - am labs after phos repletion
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to aboid withdrawal from SSRI
   - hodl LP for now
   - CXR, blood cultures, and UA to screen for additional sources of
   infection that can cause acute mental status changes
   #. Nausea and vomiting:
   Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital6 797**] was
   nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI series have yet been
   unrevealing. Some concern that this may be attributed to increased ICH
   in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS
   lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG:
   Copy of EKG was not sent with patient; however, reportedly had diffuse
   ST and T changes that were attributed to nausea and vomiting and
   resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were
   reportedly negative at [**Hospital6 797**]. ECHO was performed and
   showed anteroseptal akinesis of left ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - Consider TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:
   Patient is reportedly in remission after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD
   methotrexate, and intrathecal methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related
   to recurrence of his lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service- consult heme/onc this am
   - Consider LP to rule out recurrent CNS lymphoma however unclear if can
   do this in the setting of MRI changes
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma:
   Recent labs to check HPA showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and
   cortisol with slightly high FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26
   (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer:
   Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection. Appears
   to be without obvious infection at this time as drainage is
   serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU due to acute mental status changes, respiratory failure, and a decubitus ulcer. He was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. His medical history includes a pituitary macroadenoma, and recent labs showed normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and cortisol levels, but slightly high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin levels.

The patient's current condition is complicated by a range of factors, including:

1. Acute mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes are severe enough to warrant intubation for airway protection. Possible etiologies include intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion, or a recurrence of his lymphoma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage IV decubitus ulcer with a recent pseudomonal infection.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation and is receiving treatment with polyethylene glycol and senna.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to his underlying condition or a side effect of his medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrence of lymphoma: The patient's recent MRI showed abnormal hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe and anterior left temporal lobe, which may indicate a recurrence of his lymphoma.
2. Infection: The patient's decubitus ulcer is at risk of becoming infected, and he is also at risk of developing a pulmonary infection due to his intubation.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's acute mental status changes may be related to a neurological complication, such as a seizure or encephalopathy.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent EKG showed diffuse ST and T changes, which may indicate a cardiac complication.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Attempt to liberate from sedation overnight to assess his underlying mental status.
2. Consider extubation if no neurosurgical involvement.
3. Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery consult input.
4. Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time.
5. Continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI.
6. Hold LP for now.
7. CXR, blood cultures, and UA to screen for additional sources of infection that can cause acute mental status changes.
8. Wound care consult for the decubitus ulcer.
9. Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full evaluation from wound care team.
10. Consider TEE to fully assess the patient's cardiac status."

   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by

   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.

   Disposition: ICU care for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and recent recurrence of lymphoma in the central nervous system (CNS). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, respiratory failure, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring. The following potential medical complications are of concern:

1. Recurrent lymphoma: The patient has a history of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the recent lumbar puncture (LP) results suggest that the lymphoma has recurred in the CNS. This may require further treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's LP results showed a high opening pressure, which may indicate a risk of hemorrhage. The patient's history of DVT and recent anticoagulation therapy may also increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a seizure disorder, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, which requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. The patient's history of DVT and recent anticoagulation therapy may also increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or a side effect of chemotherapy. The patient's history of DVT and recent anticoagulation therapy may also increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may be at risk for infection and requires close monitoring.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires:

1. Close monitoring of his condition, including regular assessments of his mental status, respiratory function, and cardiovascular status.
2. Prompt treatment of any infections, including pneumonia and DVT.
3. Further evaluation and treatment of his seizures, if necessary.
4. Management of his nausea and vomiting, including the use of antiemetic medications and hydration therapy.
5. Close monitoring of his sacral decubitus ulcer, including regular assessments of its appearance and the use of wound care measures to prevent infection.
6. Further evaluation and treatment of his recurrent lymphoma, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient requires prompt treatment of any infections, including pneumonia and DVT, and further evaluation and treatment of his seizures, if necessary. The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer requires close monitoring, and the patient's recurrent lymphoma requires further evaluation and treatment."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH, most likely recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate heme/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   # Respiratory failure: Sputum and consolidation on CXR suggest possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was intubated for airway
   protection at OSH
   - sent sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 2 of 10
   - plan for extubation today, if possible
   #  Hypophosphatemia: Unclear etiology.  Unknown why it would be due to
   decreased absorption.  Also could be from increased losses.  Unlikely
hungry bone
 given normal calcium.   Could contribute to MS changes at
   this low of a level.
   -check PTH
   -urine lytes
   -repeat levels later this am
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing. Some concern that this may be
   attributed to increased ICH in setting of known pituitary macroadenoma
   or new recurrence of NCS lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TEE to fully assess
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate. Possible his AMS is related to recurrence of his
   lymphoma.
   - Appreciate consultation from BMT service
   - FU LP results
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   and will need to be rescheduled
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care consult
   - Potential surgery consult for further debridement pending full
   evaluation from wound care team

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
   [**2144-8-13**], the LVEF is less vigorous. The pericardial effusion is
   slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade.
   CXR in OMR today
   MRI/MRA final read:
   1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
   involving the
   right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes, with more focal
   areas of
   parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe, also right greater than
   left.
   Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent
   lymphoma
   (especially given the patient's history of Burkitt's lymphoma) as well
   as a
   meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis, although other viral
   or
   bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar
   appearance.
   2. Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal
   disease
   with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right
   hippocampus, which
   may represent acute infarcts, although they may be related to
   lymphomatous
   involvement versus infectious process given the findings above. Hypoxic
   injury would be a less likely differential consideration.
   3. Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion. There is no definite
   evidence of venous thrombosis, although the sigmoid sinuses and the
   visualized
   internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated.
   4. No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of
   the
   head, although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises
   the
   possibility of a small aneurysm. This was suboptimally evaluated given
   the
   degree of patient motion. At the time of followup imaging, the MRA
   sequence
   could be repeated.
   5. Pituitary adenoma, not significantly changed since the prior
   examination
   when accounting for differences in technique, although dedicated
   imaging of
   the sella was not obtained today.
    Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p

   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   early today that led to intubation for airway protection.
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH, most likely recurrent lymphoma.

   or new recurrence of NCS lymphoma.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, acromegaly, and pituitary macroadenoma, who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and nausea and vomiting. He was intubated for airway protection and received antibiotics for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of lymphoma in the central nervous system, which is suspected to be the cause of his altered mental status.

Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of lymphoma in the central nervous system: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS, which is supported by the elevated LDH and MRI findings.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to healthcare-associated pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics.
3. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's hypophosphatemia is unclear in etiology, but it may be due to decreased absorption or increased losses.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be attributed to increased ICH in the setting of known pituitary macroadenoma or new recurrence of NCS lymphoma.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which may be related to the patient's underlying condition or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection, which may be complicated by the patient's underlying condition.
7. Pituitary macroadenoma: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma may be contributing to his symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, and may require surgical resection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a seizure, which is a possibility given the patient's underlying condition.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a hemorrhage, which is a possibility given the patient's underlying condition.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status may be due to an infection, which is a possibility given the patient's underlying condition.
4. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status may be due to meningitis, which is a possibility given the patient's underlying condition.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation if possible.
3. Continue tube feeds and monitor the patient's nutritional status.
4. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and initiate QID fingersticks if serum glucose is elevated.
5. Continue pain management with acetaminophen and monitor the patient's pain status.
6. Consider surgical resection of the pituitary macroadenoma.
7. Consider wound care consult and potential surgery consult for further debridement of the sacral decubitus ulcer.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte status and consider checking PTH and urine lytes.
9. Consider initiating stress ulcer prophylaxis with lansoprazole.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary."

   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also

   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission

   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU after self-extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has developed respiratory failure, with a SpO2 of 100% and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 168. The ABG results show a pH of 7.51, PCO2 of 25, PO2 of 67, and HCO3 of 23.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is 108 bpm, and his blood pressure is 144/96 mmHg. He has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12. He has a history of pituitary macroadenoma and is currently receiving dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H.
* Hematological: The patient has a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 60 K/uL.
* Infection: The patient has developed a rash, which is likely due to a drug reaction. He also has sputum growing Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and consolidation on CXR, suggesting possible healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to multiorgan failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, rash, and sputum growing GPCs suggest that he may be at risk for sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of DVT and anticoagulation therapy make him at risk for bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's sputum growing GPCs and consolidation on CXR suggest that he may have a pulmonary infection, which can progress to sepsis.
* Malignancy: The patient's history of lymphoma and recurrent symptoms suggest that he may have recurrent lymphoma, which can progress to multiorgan failure.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H for pituitary macroadenoma
* Vancomycin and cefepime for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia
* Lovenox for anticoagulation
* Ondansetron and dexamethasone for nausea and vomiting
* Wound care for sacral decubitus ulcer

Further evaluation and management of the patient's condition will require:

* Neurology consult input
* Neurosurgery consult input
* BMT consult input
* Neuro/onc consult input
* Follow-up of LP results and heme/path
* Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline
* Continue dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H
* Follow-up of sputum ctx
* Plan for 10-day course of vancomycin and cefepime
* Full brain XRT vs methotrexate
* Contact oncology early Monday"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 41-year-old male, is a high-grade B-cell lymphoma patient who was admitted to the ICU after self-extubation. He has a history of acromegaly, pituitary macroadenoma, and previous treatment for lymphoma. The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, but self-extubated and is now on non-invasive ventilation.
2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection.
3. Lymphoma recurrence: The patient's LP results suggest recurrent lymphoma in the CNS.
4. Coag + Staph sputum: The patient has a positive sputum culture for coag + staph.
5. Rash: The patient has developed a rash, likely due to a drug reaction.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient has ongoing nausea and vomiting, possibly related to increased ICP.
7. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's positive sputum culture and decubitus ulcer increase the risk of infection.
2. Lymphoma progression: The patient's recurrent lymphoma in the CNS may progress, leading to worsening neurological symptoms.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased risk of mortality.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of DVT and recent EKG changes may indicate underlying cardiovascular disease.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and recent seizure may indicate neurological complications, such as bleeding or malignancy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**].
2. F/u sputum culture and start 10-day course of Vancomycin/Cefepime.
3. Restart Lovenox for anticoagulation.
4. Continue supportive treatment for nausea and vomiting.
5. Schedule follow-up LP results and heme/path.
6. Consult neurology, neurosurgery, and oncology services to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider surgical resection of the pituitary macroadenoma once the patient's malignancy workup and treatment are complete."

   Assessment and Plan
 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: ?PEG in near future, will readdress tomorrow as not taking
   good PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Acute Mental Status Change, Pituitary Macroadenoma, Acromegaly
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: ?PEG in near future, will readdress tomorrow as not taking
   good PO

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly, pituitary macroadenoma, and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. The patient recently self-extubated, and his current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a spontaneous Vt of 690 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, and RR of 12. His ABG results show a pH of 7.51, pCO2 of 25 mmHg, and pO2 of 67 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is 144/96 mmHg, and his heart rate is 108 bpm. His cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, and an echocardiogram showed anteroseptal akinesis of the left ventricle.
* Neurological status: The patient has a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma recurrence, and his LP results suggest that he has a lymphoma recurrence in the CNS. He also has a rash, which is likely a drug rash possibly caused by Vancomycin.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has nausea and vomiting, which may be related to increased intracranial pressure.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low platelet count, and his WBC count is slightly elevated.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and his BUN level is 23 mg/dL.
* Hepatic status: The patient's bilirubin level is 0.4 mg/dL, and his alkaline phosphatase level is 95 IU/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and he may require further respiratory support.
* Infection: The patient has a rash, which may be a sign of infection. He also has a sputum culture growing GPCs, which may indicate a healthcare-associated pneumonia.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's LP results suggest that he may have a small hemorrhage in the CNS.
* Seizure: The patient's altered mental status may be related to a seizure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of DVT and is on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

The plan of care includes:

* Continuing dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H for 10 days.
* Restarting Lovenox for anticoagulation.
* Holding on further dilaudid or nortriptyline.
* Continuing citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI.
* Sending VBG.
* F/u sputum ctx.
* Plan for 10-day course of Vancomycin/Cefepime.
* FU LP results.
* [Month 11] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, contact [Name]-Onc early Monday.
* Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone for nausea and vomiting.
* Bolus 1L now and start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO.
* IV phos.
* Wound care recs applied for sacral decubitus ulcer.
* Discuss plan with HCP today."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Neuro-oncology feels that full brain XRT would be the next step, but
   primary team feels that he would not be able to tolerate this treatment
   without intubation and unclear the benefit of intubation at this point
   - Will hold off on XRT pending discussions with radiation oncology,
   BMt, and neuro-oncology teams
   - Continue high-dose Decadron
   - Will involve social worker [**Name (NI) 1072**] regarding goals of care, family
   situation, etc
   - FU final LP results
   - Check tumor lysis labs
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.
   - Stat CT head now to assess for herniation vs increased ICP.  Nausea
   and vomiting also likely due to increased ICP.
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   - Have stopped acyclovir
   - Check EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine output.
   - Stop D51/2NS at this time to minimize worsening cerebral edema
   - Check CT head as above
   - Check urine lytes, recheck serum lytes, osmolarity
   - Replete lytes as needed
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH, now exubated and doing well.
   - F/u sputum ctx
   - Plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 4 of 10
   #. Hiccups: Will try thorazine for hiccup prevention.
   #. Rash: Likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   - Will monitor
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Neuro-oncology feels that full brain XRT would be the next step, but
   primary team feels that he would not be able to tolerate this treatment
   without intubation and unclear the benefit of intubation at this point
   - Will hold off on XRT pending discussions with radiation oncology,
   BMt, and neuro-oncology teams
   - Continue high-dose Decadron
   - Will involve social worker [**Name (NI) 1072**] regarding goals of care, family
   situation, etc
   - FU final LP results
   - Check tumor lysis labs
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.
   - Stat CT head now to assess for herniation vs increased ICP.  Nausea
   and vomiting also likely due to increased ICP.
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   - Have stopped acyclovir
   - Check EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine output.
   - Stop D51/2NS at this time to minimize worsening cerebral edema
   - Check CT head as above
   - Check urine lytes, recheck serum lytes, osmolarity
   - Replete lytes as needed
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH, now exubated and doing well.
   - F/u sputum ctx
   - Plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 4 of 10
   #. Hiccups: Will try thorazine for hiccup prevention.
   #. Rash: Likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   - Will monitor
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, currently in the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and increased urine output. He was transferred from another hospital after an episode of altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. He recently self-extubated and is now experiencing worsening altered mental status despite reduced sedation. The patient has a diagnosis of recurrent CNS lymphoma, and his neuro-oncology team recommends full brain XRT, but the primary team is concerned about his ability to tolerate this treatment without intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's worsening altered mental status is likely due to the recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS, which may lead to increased intracranial pressure, herniation, or seizures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the possibility of healthcare-associated pneumonia, which is suspected based on the sputum and consolidation on CXR.
3. Central Diabetes Insipidus: The patient's increased urine output may be due to central diabetes insipidus, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to his underlying lymphoma and the presence of coagulopathy on his lab results.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected or worsen if not properly managed with wound care and antibiotics.
6. Hiccups: The patient's hiccups may become a problem if not managed with thorazine or other anti-hiccup medications.
7. Rash: The patient's rash may be due to an allergic reaction to one of his medications, such as Vancomycin, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and respiratory function closely.
2. Consider intubation if the patient's respiratory function worsens.
3. Manage the patient's central diabetes insipidus with fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed.
4. Continue antibiotics for the suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia.
5. Manage the patient's coagulopathy with anticoagulation therapy and platelet transfusions as needed.
6. Provide wound care and antibiotics for the sacral decubitus ulcer.
7. Manage the patient's hiccups with thorazine or other anti-hiccup medications.
8. Consider restarting acyclovir if the patient's rash is due to an allergic reaction to Vancomycin.
9. Discuss the patient's goals of care with his family and social worker to ensure that his treatment is aligned with his wishes."

   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.

   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. The patient's condition has been stable, but he has developed several complications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LDH and preliminary LP results suggesting recurrent lymphoma. His chest X-ray shows bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis, and his sputum culture grew Staph aureus coag +, which is consistent with healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's rash is likely due to drug rash, possibly related to vancomycin.

The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation. He also has an abnormal EKG with diffuse ST and T changes, which were attributed to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. His TTE showed anteroseptal akinesis of the left ventricle, which is new.

The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer is reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection, but it appears to be without obvious infection at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent lymphoma: The patient's LP results suggest recurrent lymphoma, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture grew Staph aureus coag +, which is consistent with healthcare-associated pneumonia.
3. Drug rash: The patient's rash is likely due to drug rash, possibly related to vancomycin.
4. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
5. Abnormal EKG: The patient's EKG shows diffuse ST and T changes, which may be related to electrolyte abnormalities or other underlying conditions.
6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer is reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent pseudomonal infection, which requires wound care and further evaluation.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation with Lovenox, and wound care for the sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's family and healthcare providers should be informed of the patient's condition and treatment plan to ensure coordinated care."

 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, also some concern for infection or hemorrhage.  STAT head CT here
   (limited by motion) was able to rule out massive hemorrhage causing
   herniation, though still possibility of small hermorrhage.  Could also
   be seizure.  MRI here with ?hemorrhage versus malignancy.  In the
   setting of elevated LDH and preliminary LP results, most likely
   recurrent lymphoma.
   - Appreciate neurology consult input
   - Appreciate neurosurgery consult input
   - Appreicate BMT input
   - Appreciate neuro/onc input
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Hold on further dilaudid or nortriptyline at this time, though may
   continue to give citalopram to avoid withdrawal from SSRI
   - Continue Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**]
   - d/c Acyclovir as per neuro did not suggest it and it seems this is
   lymphoma according to LP
   - send VBG
   # Respiratory failure/Coag + Staph sputum: Sputum and consolidation on
   CXR suggest possible healthcare associated pneumonia.  Patient was
   intubated for airway protection at OSH
   - f/u sputum ctx
   - plan for 10 day course with Vancomycin/Cefepime, today is day 3 of 10
   # Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Patient is reportedly in remission
   after hyper-CVAD, R-[**Hospital1 **], HD methotrexate, and intrathecal
   methotrexate but LP suggests that he is having recurrence.
   - Appreciate multiple consulting services
   - FU LP results
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need full brain XRT vs methotrexate, Contact [**Name (NI) **]-Onc early Monday
   #. Rash: likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   #. Nausea and vomiting: Patient's original presenting complaint to [**Hospital 9798**] was nausea and vomiting. Abdominal films and upper GI
   series have yet been unrevealing.  Likely related to increased ICP
   given high opening LP pressure.
   - Treat supportively with ondansetron and dexamethasone
   - bolus 1L now then start maintenance fluids as not taking good PO
   (D51/2NS @125)
   - IV phos
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   #. Report of abnormal EKG: Copy of EKG was not sent with patient;
   however, reportedly had diffuse ST and T changes that were attributed
   to nausea and vomiting and resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Two
   sets of cardiac enzymes were reportedly negative at [**Hospital3 1573**]. ECHO was performed and showed anteroseptal akinesis of left
   ventricle, which is new
   -EKG here unchanged from 2 prior with exception of ?U waves
   - TTE here without change from previous except dynamic LV
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of CNS lymphoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and altered mental status. He has a poor prognosis and the plan of care is to focus on comfort care. The patient is receiving daily radiation therapy, and has been given morphine for pain and discomfort.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/103 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His respiratory support includes a face tent and ABG values are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated calcium level.

The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. He is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer treatment.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and further decline in his respiratory status could lead to worsening of his condition.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and the presence of a decubitus ulcer.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH level increase his risk of bleeding.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated calcium level could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other electrolyte imbalances.
5. Worsening of CNS lymphoma: The patient's poor prognosis and declining mental status could indicate worsening of his CNS lymphoma.
6. Pain and discomfort: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure could lead to worsening of his pain and discomfort.
7. Inability to tolerate radiation therapy: The patient's poor prognosis and respiratory failure could make it difficult for him to tolerate further radiation therapy.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. Additionally, the patient's pain and discomfort should be managed effectively to improve his quality of life."

   Chief Complaint: CNS Lymphoma
   24 Hour Events:
   - [**Doctor Last Name 3337**]/BMT: Feel that intrathecal chemotherapy not possible at this
   point, should try XRT
   - Rad/Onc: Reviewed him in neuro-onc conference.  Want to try XRT
   without intubating him, plan 2 weeks of daily tx, M-F.
   - Went for XRT [**2144-12-28**] for mapping, tolerated well
   - Gave 1L NS at 5pm for tachycardia (HR 120's) and negative fluid
   balance, HR decreased to the 100-110's
   - HCP came in at 6pm today, discussed poor prognosis, plan of care
   - Made CPR not indicated
   - EEG ordered but not done
   - Couldn't get NG tube in
   - Had episode of tachypnea with hiccups at 10pm after attempt to place
   NGT, likely aspirated, no intervention.  At 5am, started to desat to
   the  80's, requiring some suctioning but appeared very uncomfortable.
   Gave 2mg IV morphine and updated HCP about deterioration.

   CXR today in OMR
   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Feel that he was uncomfortable overnight and
   responded to morphine.  Best course for the patient at this point is to
   become [**Month/Year (2) **] measures only.
   - Have discussed CMO with health care proxy, will be by this afternoon
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine prn for patient [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to transition to drip at
   some point today
   - Will stop antibiotics at this time, as not [**First Name3 (LF) **] measures
   - Will give 1L NS now to prevent tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Scheduled for course of XRT today but given clinical deterioration,
   unlikely to benefit him and would cause more distress than benefit.
   Will stop treatments
   - Continue high-dose Decadron for palliation
   - Health care proxy updated on poor prognosis and plan
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - CT head yesterday not significantly changed from previous but need
   MRI to fully assess
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.  Now urine output has tapered off and urine appears
   concentrated based on urine lytes.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given CMO status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied for [**Date Range **]
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: None at this time, NG tube unable to be placed, will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Feel that he was uncomfortable overnight and
   responded to morphine.  Best course for the patient at this point is to
   become [**Month/Year (2) **] measures only.
   - Have discussed CMO with health care proxy, will be by this afternoon
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine prn for patient [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to transition to drip at
   some point today
   - Will stop antibiotics at this time, as not [**First Name3 (LF) **] measures
   - Will give 1L NS now to prevent tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Scheduled for course of XRT today but given clinical deterioration,
   unlikely to benefit him and would cause more distress than benefit.
   Will stop treatments
   - Continue high-dose Decadron for palliation
   - Health care proxy updated on poor prognosis and plan
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - CT head yesterday not significantly changed from previous but need
   MRI to fully assess
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.  Now urine output has tapered off and urine appears
   concentrated based on urine lytes.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given CMO status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied for [**Date Range **]
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: None at this time, NG tube unable to be placed, will
   continue to hold

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and intubated for airway protection. He was transferred from another hospital and has been receiving treatment for his lymphoma, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, his condition has deteriorated significantly overnight, with persistent tachypnea and hypoxia, requiring oxygen delivery through a face mask. His LDH levels are increasing, and his clinical course is now considered poor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and increasing LDH levels may indicate worsening neurological involvement, which could lead to seizures, brain edema, or other neurological complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a sacral decubitus ulcer make him prone to infection, which could be severe and life-threatening.
5. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's increasing urine output and potential central diabetes insipidus may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which could exacerbate his respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's inability to tolerate food and fluids, combined with his risk of aspiration, may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
7. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction may increase his risk of bleeding, which could be severe and life-threatening.

Based on the patient's deteriorating condition and poor prognosis, it is recommended that he be transitioned to comfort measures only, with a focus on palliative care and symptom management."

   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Likely related to
   aspiration event overnight, and possibly complicated by CNS disease.
   Also being treated for HAP and growing MRSA in sputum
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine prn for patient comfort
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime, today is day 5 of 10
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Scheduled for course of XRT x 2weeks that started  yesterday
   - Continue high-dose Decadron
   - Health care proxy updated on poor prognosis
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time, will follow
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - CT head yesterday not significantly changed from previous but need
   MRI to fully assess
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   - Have stopped acyclovir
   - Check EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.  Now urine output has tapered off and urine appears
   concentrated based on urine lytes.
   - Continue IVF as needed for urine output
   - Check CT head as above
   - Replete lytes as needed
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for comfort.
   #. Rash: Likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   - Will monitor
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**].
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Likely related to
   aspiration event overnight, and possibly complicated by CNS disease.
   Also being treated for HAP and growing MRSA in sputum
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine prn for patient comfort
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime, today is day 5 of 10
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Scheduled for course of XRT x 2weeks that started  yesterday
   - Continue high-dose Decadron
   - Health care proxy updated on poor prognosis
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time, will follow
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - CT head yesterday not significantly changed from previous but need
   MRI to fully assess
   - FU final LP results and heme/path
   - Continue Decadron as above
   - Have stopped acyclovir
   - Check EEG to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.  Now urine output has tapered off and urine appears
   concentrated based on urine lytes.
   - Continue IVF as needed for urine output
   - Check CT head as above
   - Replete lytes as needed
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for comfort.
   #. Rash: Likely drug rash, possibly [**2-17**] Vancomycin
   - Will monitor
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Restarted lovenox for anticoagulation
   # Acromegaly and Pituitary Macroadenoma: Recent labs to check HPA
   showed normal TSH, LH, testosterone, and cortisol with slightly high
   FSH (14, ULN: 12) and high prolactin at 26 (ULN: 15).
   - Will eventually need surgical resection that was to be set up on
   outpatient basis; though, appointment with neurosurgery was [**2144-12-24**]
   - Defer until malignancy workup/tx complete

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and was later transferred to the ICU due to intubation for airway protection. The patient had a self-extubation episode on [**12-26**] and has been experiencing tachypnea and hypoxia, requiring high-flow oxygen delivery in a face tent form. The patient has also been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in the CNS, and has been scheduled for a course of XRT for 2 weeks.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating active lymphoma. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results are pending, but the clinical picture is consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.

The patient has been experiencing various complications, including tachypnea and hypoxia, altered mental status, increased urine output, hiccups, and rash. The patient has also been diagnosed with sacral decubitus ulcer and has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pituitary macroadenoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an increased risk of sepsis.
3. Central diabetes insipidus: The patient's increased urine output may be due to central diabetes insipidus, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and increased LDH levels may indicate meningitis, which can lead to severe neurological complications.
5. Ischemia: The patient's CT head scan shows relatively stable vasogenic edema in the temporal lobes, which may indicate ischemia.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which may indicate pneumonia.
7. Wound infection: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected, leading to severe complications.
8. Thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and the use of Lovenox may increase the risk of thrombosis.
9. Pituitary dysfunction: The patient's pituitary macroadenoma may lead to pituitary dysfunction, including hypopituitarism or hyperpituitarism.
10. Malignant spinal cord compression: The patient's lymphoma may compress the spinal cord, leading to severe neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status: Comfort measures only, DNR/DNI
   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU after being transferred from another hospital due to altered mental status and intubation for airway protection. The patient has undergone self-extubation and is now in a comfort care only status with worsening altered mental status despite reduced sedation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Face tent on 100% FiO2, SpO2 98%
* Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia, blood pressure 119/60 mmHg
* Neurological: Obtunded, not responsive to verbal or tactile stimuli, does not follow commands
* Renal: Creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL
* Hepatic: Total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 73 IU/L
* Hematological: White blood cell count 6.7 K/uL, platelet count 189 K/uL
* Coagulation: International normalized ratio 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 30.9 seconds
* Electrolytes: Sodium 136 mg/dL, potassium 2.9 mEq/L, chloride 3.9 mEq/L
* Lactic acid 2.3 mmol/L

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently on face tent on 100% FiO2, and the SpO2 is 98%. However, the patient's respiratory status is not stable, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 119/60 mmHg, which is relatively low. The patient's heart rate is 125 bpm, which is slightly elevated. There is a risk of cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is worsening, with decreased responsiveness and no follow-up of commands. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration and potential brain death.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pseudomonal infection in the sacral decubitus ulcer, and there is a risk of further infection and sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Metabolic derangements: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. There is a risk of further metabolic derangements and potential organ failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and neurological function. The patient's comfort care plan should be continued, and all non-comfort medications should be stopped. The patient's healthcare proxy should be updated regularly, and the patient's family should be informed of the patient's condition and prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 65-inch tall and 72 kg individual, is a 24-hour event in the ICU with a diagnosis of lymphoma, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and a decubitus ulcer. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate infusions and has been experiencing desats to the 80s, which were improved with NG suctioning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show an increase in uric acid levels, LDH, and lactate, with a decrease in potassium levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of a decubitus ulcer, which can increase the risk of respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and increased lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Decubitus ulcer progression: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen due to the patient's immobility and lack of proper wound care, leading to increased risk of infection and poor wound healing.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which may increase the risk of hyperglycemia-related complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are decreased, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other electrolyte-related complications.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and increased lactate levels may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure, altered mental status, and increased lactate levels may indicate the presence of organ dysfunction, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's altered mental status and lack of appetite may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
9. Pressure injuries: The patient's immobility and lack of proper wound care may lead to pressure injuries, which can increase the risk of infection and poor wound healing.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's increased lactate levels and decreased potassium levels may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**], now [**Month/Year (2) 303**] secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Therefore, HCP [**Name (NI) 1850**] and patient made
   [**Name (NI) 303**].
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine drip for patient comfort
   - PRN fluid boluses to help treat tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   - Decadron stopped
   - Health care proxy being updated regularly
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for comfort.
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given [**Date Range 303**] status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied for comfort

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**], now [**Month/Year (2) 303**] secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Therefore, HCP [**Name (NI) 1850**] and patient made
   [**Name (NI) 303**].
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine drip for patient comfort
   - PRN fluid boluses to help treat tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   - Decadron stopped
   - Health care proxy being updated regularly
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for comfort.
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given [**Date Range 303**] status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied for comfort

   Communication:  Comments:
   Code status: Comfort measures only
   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and was subsequently extubated. The patient has a poor prognosis with metastatic disease to the brain and is currently on comfort measures only.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% FiO2. The patient's laboratory results show increasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which may indicate worsening disease.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Tachypnea and hypoxia: The patient requires high-flow oxygen delivery in a face tent form to maintain oxygen saturation.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is not responsive to verbal or tactile stimuli, which may be related to recurrent CNS lymphoma.
3. Increased urine output: The patient is producing a large amount of urine, which may be related to central diabetes insipidus or other underlying medical conditions.
4. Hiccups: The patient has experienced hiccups, which may be related to thorazine or other medications.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer with a recent pseudomonal infection, which may require wound care and other interventions.
6. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox, which may need to be stopped given the patient's current condition.

The patient's medications include:

1. Morphine sulfate for pain management
2. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis
3. Metoprolol for heart rate control
4. Oral PPO for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in a face tent form
2. Maintain morphine drip for patient comfort
3. Administer PRN fluid boluses to help treat tachycardia and other symptoms
4. Continue wound care and other interventions for the sacral decubitus ulcer
5. Stop Lovenox due to the patient's current condition
6. Consider other interventions, such as palliative care, to improve the patient's quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and high grade B-cell lymphoma (s/p
   admission at [**Hospital1 1**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**]) who was transferred
   from [**Hospital6 797**] following episode of altered mental status
   that led to intubation for airway protection now s/p self extubation
   [**12-26**], now [**Month/Year (2) 303**] secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.
   #. Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Overnight has had persistent tachypnea and
   hypoxia, requiring face mask for oxygen delivery.  Possibly related to
   aspiration event overnight, but unfortunately more likely related to
   systemic lymphoma as LDH increasing.  Feel that this represents a
   significant downtown in his clinical course and XRT very unlikely to
   benefit him at this time.  Therefore, HCP [**Name (NI) 1850**] and patient made
   [**Name (NI) 303**].
   - Continue high-flow oxygen delivery in face tent form to make patient
   comfortable
   - Morphine drip for patient comfort
   - PRN fluid boluses to help treat tachycardia and perhaps help patient
   feel better on some level
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID): CSF results and
   clinical picture consistent with recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Now with
   worsening altered mental status despite less sedation.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   - Decadron stopped
   - Health care proxy being updated regularly
   - FU final LP results
   - Tumor lysis labs negative at this time
   #. Altered mental status:  Most likely due to recurrence of lymphoma in
   CNS, especially given LP results and increasing LDH.  Still not
   responsive except to noxious stimuli.
   - Now [**Name (NI) 303**] as above
   #. Increased urine output: Some concern for central diabetes insipidus
   given known increased intracranial pressure and increased urine
   output.
   #. Hiccups: Unclear if thorazine had benefit yesterday but can continue
   for comfort.
   #. History of DVT in [**8-23**]: Supposed to be on Lovenox for 6 months
   after the event.
   - Will stop Lovenox given [**Date Range 303**] status
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Reportedly a stage IV ulcer with recent
   pseudomonal infection. Appears to be without obvious infection at this
   time as drainage is serosanguinous.
   - Wound care recs applied for comfort

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. He was admitted to the hospital after an episode of altered mental status, which led to intubation for airway protection. The patient was previously extubated but has since self-extubated.

The patient's current condition is critical, with persistent tachypnea and hypoxia requiring high-flow oxygen delivery. His mental status has worsened, and he is now unresponsive except to noxious stimuli. His laboratory results show increasing LDH levels, which suggests a significant downturn in his clinical course.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Central diabetes insipidus: The patient's increased urine output may be due to central diabetes insipidus, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer is reportedly a stage IV ulcer with a recent pseudomonal infection. This could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or osteomyelitis.
4. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on Lovenox. Stopping Lovenox may increase the risk of DVT recurrence.
5. Lymphoma progression: The patient's lymphoma is likely progressing, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
6. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic disease to the brain may worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and further compromise of his mental status.
7. Infection: The patient's recent pseudomonal infection and sacral decubitus ulcer may increase his risk of developing further infections.

Given the patient's critical condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue high-flow oxygen delivery, morphine drip for comfort, and PRN fluid boluses to help manage his tachycardia and tachypnea. Additionally, the patient's healthcare proxy should be updated regularly, and further evaluation of his lymphoma and metastatic disease is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old gentleman with a history of acromegaly and high-grade B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status and intubated for airway protection. He was later transferred to the ICU due to worsening altered mental status and was diagnosed with metastatic disease to the brain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 36.4°C, T-current 35.6°C, HR 125 bpm, BP 123/60 mmHg, RR 12 inspirations per minute, SpO2 88%.
* Respiratory support: None
* Neurological status: Obtunded, not responsive to verbal or tactile stimuli, does not follow commands, appears comfortably, slow breathing
* Cardiovascular status: RRR, nl s1 s2 no m
* Pulmonary status: Rhonchi bilaterally on anterior exam, increased from yesterday
* Abdominal status: +BS, soft NT, ND
* Extremities: 2+ b/l LE pitting edema
* Laboratory results: WBC 6.7 K/uL, Hct 33.2%, Plt 189 K/uL, Cr 0.4 mg/dL, TCO2 21, Glucose 90 mg/dL, Lactic Acid 2.3 mmol/L, Albumin 3.6 g/dL, LDH 1081 IU/L, Ca++ 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.0 mg/dL, PO4 2.6 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with recurrent CNS lymphoma and is currently on comfort measures only. All non-comfort medications have been stopped, and no blood draws or imaging are planned. The patient's health care proxy is being updated regularly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory status and the fact that he is not receiving any respiratory support.
* Cardiac arrest due to the patient's cardiovascular status and the fact that he is not receiving any cardiac support.
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a sacral decubitus ulcer.
* Bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the presence of a port-a-cath.
* Hypercalcemia due to the patient's elevated calcium levels.
* Hyperphosphatemia due to the patient's elevated phosphate levels.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his care accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
