 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM: No clear etiology for persistant ventricular tachycardia /
   fibrillation. Although cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, this is
   in the setting of repeated defibrillation and in the absence of ECG
   changes. Given known total occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to
   scar tissue or new ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.
   Differential diagnosis for precipitants of VT storm would include
   electrolyte imbalance, new onset heart failure or exacerbation,
   ischemia and drug toxicity / effect. Patient at risk of VT/VF given
   past MI and resulting scar in posterior and infeerior walls.
   -- Continue amiodarone load, pt received 150mg bolus, would continue IV
   load at 1mg/min (60mg/hr) overnight, then reduce to 0.5mg/min (30mg/hr)
   (maximum daily dose 2 gm)
   -- IV Lidocaine with 100mg bolused, continue 2mg drip, monitor mental
   status
   -- Cont low dose Metoprolol to supress ectopy
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
   -- NPO overnight, will likely need diagnostic cath to rule out active
   ischemia before EP study
   -- EP consult in AM for potential EP study
   -- Continue heparin drip due to stunned myocardium from repeated
   cardioversions
   # CORONARIES:  As above, will need to evaluate for active CAD
   -- Beta blocker
   -- Aspirin
   -- Statin
   # SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, ACUTE VS CHRONIC:  Mildly depressed EF,
   unclear if this is acute change although regional wall motion
   abnormality is consistent with that from [**2127**]. No symptoms of CHF
   - Consider starting ACE-I / long acting beta blocker after procedures
   - Recent echo in [**Month (only) 11**] of this year, pending potential findings would
   consider repeating.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of the LCx and RCA, presenting with VT and electrical storm. She was defibrillated with 50J and converted to regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She received amiodarone and heparin drips, as well as lidocaine and metoprolol infusions. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, and SpO2 of 96%. Her ECG shows bradycardia with a rate in the 50s, one-to-one A:V conduction, inverted P waves in multiple leads suggesting ectopic atrial focus, and hyperacute T waves in anterolateral leads.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent VT/VF: The patient is at risk of VT/VF due to her past MI and resulting scar in the posterior and inferior walls.
2. Ischemic Insult: The patient's total occlusion of the LCx and RCA may lead to ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, potentially causing a posterior infarct.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and magnesium, should be closely monitored to prevent imbalance.
4. New Onset Heart Failure: The patient's mildly depressed EF and regional wall motion abnormality may indicate acute or chronic heart failure.
5. Valvular Disease: The patient's mild AS and Mod MR may increase her risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
6. Infection: The patient's risk of infection is increased due to her ICU stay and invasive lines.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or bleeding, is increased due to her mechanical ventilation and sedation.
8. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, is increased due to her mechanical ventilation and underlying lung disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to receive amiodarone and heparin drips, as well as lidocaine and metoprolol infusions. Her cardiac enzymes will be trended, and she will be evaluated for active CAD. An EP study may be performed to rule out active ischemia. The patient will also be started on beta blockers, aspirin, and statins to prevent further cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel coronary artery disease, total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries, who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm. She was cardioverted with 50J and converted into regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She was continued on amiodarone and heparin drip, started on lidocaine drip, and low-dose IV and oral metoprolol. The patient's mental status was below baseline after administration of fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 55 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. Her physical examination is notable for a holosystolic murmur at the base and crescendo/decrescendo at the right upper sternal border.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, with a troponin-T level of 0.27 ng/mL and a CK-MB level of 11 ng/mL. Her electrocardiogram shows bradycardia with a rate in the 50s, one-to-one A-V conduction, inverted P-waves in multiple leads suggesting an ectopic atrial focus, and hyperacute T-waves in the anterolateral leads.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF): The patient is at risk of VT/VF due to her past myocardial infarction and resulting scar tissue in the posterior and inferior walls.
2. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury: The patient's known total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries may lead to ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, which could cause a posterior infarct.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk of electrolyte imbalance due to her medications, which could exacerbate her VT/VF.
4. New onset heart failure or exacerbation: The patient's mildly depressed ejection fraction and regional wall motion abnormality may indicate new onset heart failure or exacerbation.
5. Ischemia: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries make her susceptible to ischemia.
6. Drug toxicity or effect: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol, which may have toxic or adverse effects.
7. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's mild aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation make her at risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to her indwelling lines and medical devices.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobilization and medical conditions make her susceptible to DVT and PE.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and medications may increase her risk of stress ulcer."

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel coronary artery disease, total occlusion of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries, and presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm. She was defibrillated with 50J and converted to regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She was started on amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol infusions. Her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, and she has responded to low-voltage defibrillation. She is at risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury: Given the patient's total occlusion of the LCx and RCA, there is a risk of ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, which could lead to further cardiac damage.
2. P waves present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia: The patient's ECG shows inverted P waves in multiple leads, suggesting ectopic atrial focus. If P waves are present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia, it could indicate atrial flutter or fibrillation, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Cardiac enzymes: The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, which could indicate muscle damage from defibrillation or underlying cardiac damage.
4. Systolic heart failure: The patient has mildly depressed ejection fraction, which could indicate acute or chronic systolic heart failure.
5. Valvular disease: The patient has mild aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, which could lead to flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
6. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT could progress to ventricular fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis, due to her ICU stay.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage, due to her ICU stay and potential medications.
9. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy, due to her ICU stay and potential medications.
10. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk of developing bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage, due to her heparin drip and potential medications."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT/electrical storm. She underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, which showed chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ. The EP performed a substrate ablation, but was unable to induce sustained VT. The patient developed hypoxia during the procedure, which responded to nasal oxygen therapy, and also developed angina, which responded to sublingual nitroglycerin.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 52-81 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 116/51 mmHg (67-130/69 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient's physical examination is normal, with the exception of mild right lower extremity edema and 1+ left lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.9-9.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.2-9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 178-141 x 10^9/L
* Troponin-T: 0.27-0.88 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 101-106 mg/dL

The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, with a peak CK of 630, which is likely due to muscle damage from defibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Systolic heart failure, acute or chronic, given the patient's history of CAD and mildly depressed EF
* Valvular disease, particularly mitral regurgitation, which may increase the risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes
* Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, given the patient's history of total occlusion of LCx and RCA
* P waves present on telemetry while in wide complex tachycardia, which may indicate atrial activity
* Muscle damage from defibrillation, which may lead to further elevation of cardiac enzymes

The patient's plan includes:

* ICD placement today
* Discontinuation of lidocaine and heparin infusions
* Increase in metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
* Trending of cardiac enzymes
* NPO overnight, with cardiac diet and possible transfer to the floor after procedure
* Monitoring of volume status closely due to risk of flash pulmonary edema
* Consideration of starting ACE-I and long-acting beta blocker after procedures"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT/electrical storm. She underwent EP substrate ablation and was found to have chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ. The patient developed angina, which responded to 1 SL NTG, and required NRB for short time due to hypoxia. She was given Lasix 40mg IV x1 and has a plan for ICD placement today.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VT/electrical storm and the presence of chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ, there is a risk of recurring arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest or sudden death.
2. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury: The patient's known total occlusion of LCx and RCA increases the risk of ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, which can lead to posterior infarct or further cardiac damage.
3. Systolic heart failure, acute vs chronic: The patient's mildly depressed EF and regional wall motion abnormality suggest possible acute or chronic systolic heart failure, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
4. Valvular disease: The patient's mild AS and mod MR put her at risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's basilar crackles and requirement for NRB suggest possible respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by her valvular disease and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's history of VT/electrical storm and requirement for defibrillation increases her risk of infection, particularly with organisms that are resistant to antibiotics.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's requirement for heparin and possible invasive procedures increases her risk of bleeding complications, which can be life-threatening.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and possible prolonged ICU stay increase her risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly with regard to protein, calories, and electrolytes.
9. Psychiatric complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and possible exposure to multiple medications increase her risk of psychiatric complications, such as anxiety, depression, and delirium."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient did well yesterday in cath demonstrating non-obstructed LAD and
   no change in anatomy of the CTO LCx and RCA. Then to EP for substrate
   ablation as they were unable to induce VT. Lidocaine weaned off and the
   patient remains on Amio 200 mg Qd with metoprolol 25 mg TID. Patient
   back to EP lab for ICD placement later today. Will plan on discharge
   tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM vs SVT (AVNRT w/ abberancy): No clear etiology for
   persistent ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation. Although cardiac
   enzymes are slightly elevated, this is in the setting of repeated
   defibrillation and in the absence of ECG changes. Given known total
   occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to scar tissue or new
   ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.  Also concerned that she
   may have p waves present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia.
   She has also responded to low voltage defibrillation. Cath showed
   chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ. EP substrate ablation
 to return
   for ICD placement this AM. No further episodes of VT overnight.
   -- switch Amiodarone gtt to 200mg PO daily this AM
   -- d/c lidocaine gtt, heparin gtt
   -- increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
 CK peaked at 630
   -- NPO overnight, ICD placement today
   -- EP recs appreciated
   # CORONARIES:  Cath showed occlusion of RCA and Circ, as above.
   -- increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
   -- Aspirin 325mg PO daily
   -- Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   #Elevated cardiac enzymes
 CK highly elevated compared to CKMB and
   troponins suggesting muscle damage from debrillation is contributing.
   CK peaked at 630, now downtrending.
   - trend cardiac [**Last Name (un) **]
   # SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, ACUTE VS CHRONIC:  Mildly depressed EF,
   unclear if this is acute change although regional wall motion
   abnormality is consistent with that from [**2127**]. No symptoms of CHF.
   - Consider starting ACE-I / long acting beta blocker after procedures
   - Recent echo in [**Month (only) 11**] of this year, pending potential findings would
   consider repeating.
   # VALVULAR DISEASE: Mild AS, Mod MR, pt at risk of flash pulmonary

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient did well yesterday in cath demonstrating non-obstructed LAD and
   no change in anatomy of the CTO LCx and RCA. Then to EP for substrate
   ablation as they were unable to induce VT. Lidocaine weaned off and the
   patient remains on Amio 200 mg Qd with metoprolol 25 mg TID. Patient
   back to EP lab for ICD placement later today. Will plan on discharge
   tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2139-1-2**] 05:54 PM ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA), presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed chronic occlusion of the RCA and Circ. The electrophysiology (EP) study revealed non-sustained VT that appeared to originate from the inferior septum and base. The patient underwent substrate ablation, but the EP was unable to induce sustained VT. The plan is to place an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) the next day.

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 37.8°C, HR = 52 bpm, BP = 116/51 mmHg, SpO2 = 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Mildly depressed ejection fraction (EF), unclear if this is an acute or chronic change
* Cardiac enzymes: CK peaked at 630, now downtrending
* Laboratory results: WBC = 11.9, Hct = 36.5, Plt = 178 K/uL, Cr = 0.6 mg/dL, TropT = 0.27 ng/mL, Glucose = 101 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrest
2. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury due to the total occlusion of the LCx and RCA
3. Development of heart failure, given the mildly depressed EF and regional wall motion abnormality
4. Flash pulmonary edema due to the mild aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR)
5. Complications related to the ICD placement procedure, such as infection or device malfunction

The patient's plan includes:

1. ICD placement the next day
2. Discontinuation of lidocaine and heparin infusions
3. Increase in metoprolol to 25 mg PO BID
4. Trending of cardiac enzymes
5. NPO overnight, with a plan for discharge tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view

The patient's code status is full code, and she will be monitored closely for any changes in her condition."
