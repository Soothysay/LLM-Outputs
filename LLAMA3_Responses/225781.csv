You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of PVD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was successfully coiled. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 161/58 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on aerosol-cooled face tent.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin, decreased breath sounds at the bases, and mild left facial droop. The patient's neurologic examination is stable, with intact cranial nerves II-XII and mild left finger flexion/extensor weakness.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, and iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation of 24.1%. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated.

The patient's medical conditions include severe iron deficiency/anemia, acute blood loss anemia, COPD, and PVD s/p SMA stenting. The patient is also at risk for developing pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of small effusions and atelectasis, and the patient's sputum production with a positive culture.

The patient's plan includes monitoring of neurologic examination every 2 hours, head CT if acute neuro change, and f/u neurosurgery recommendations. The patient will also continue to receive incentive spirometry, and maintain SpO2 between 92-94%. The patient's anemia will be treated with iron supplementation, and transfusions will be given as necessary. The patient's COPD will be managed with inhalers as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Neurologic complications: The patient is at risk for developing neurologic complications due to the aneurysm coiling procedure and the presence of a left medullary infarct.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the presence of small effusions and atelectasis, and the patient's sputum production with a positive culture.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to the presence of a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia will need to be closely monitored and treated to prevent further complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's PVD and HTN will need to be closely monitored to prevent cardiovascular complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD will need to be closely monitored to prevent respiratory complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

   ceftriaxone (started [**3-22**]), however, pt. has been in hospital for over
   a week.  Had CT chest on [**3-17**], but respiratory status now worse.
   - Start vanc & zosyn for possible HAP; recheck sputum sample
   - CTA chest for ?PE with D5W NaHCO3 for prehydration
   - if no PE and fails to improve with antibiotics, consider starting

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that was coiled. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. The patient has developed several complications, including:

* Hypoxia with evidence of small effusions and atelectasis, sputum production, and a positive culture, concerning for pneumonia (PNA).
* Left-sided weakness and expected left medullary infarct due to the PICA aneurysm coiling.
* Right femoral hematoma, which is stable.
* Severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, with a hematocrit (HCT) trended down post-procedure.
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a history of exacerbations.
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a history of stenting.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and analgesics. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of hypoxia and respiratory failure, potentially requiring reintubation.
* Progression of left-sided weakness and potential neurologic deficits.
* Development of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anemia and anticoagulation therapy.
* Delayed wound healing and increased risk of infection due to the patient's compromised immune system.
* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmias, due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.
* Nutritional deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's altered nutritional status and medication therapy.
* Increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome due to the patient's compromised immune system and underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm and underwent coiling. She has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 161/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on an aerosol-cool face tent.

The patient's neurological examination is as follows:

* Alert and oriented x3
* Right radial pulse present
* Left facial droop mild
* Pupils reactive
* Finger flexion and extension, biceps, and ankle flexion and extension are 4+ and 5+, respectively

The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, with sputum production and a positive culture, suggesting pneumonia. She is being treated with ceftriaxone and is being encouraged to perform incentive spirometry.

The patient has a severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being followed closely.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, with a bare metal stent in the SMA and is being treated with Plavix and ASA. Her PVD is being managed with aspirin and Plavix.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is being treated with inhalers as needed.

The patient has a history of iron deficiency and is being treated with iron supplements.

The patient has a PICC line and an arterial line, which were both inserted on [**2189-3-23**].

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Neurological complications: The patient has a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness, which may lead to further neurological deterioration.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, with sputum production and a positive culture, which may lead to further respiratory decline.
3. Hematological complications: The patient has a severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, which may lead to further anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and is being treated with Plavix and ASA, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications.
5. Infectious complications: The patient has a positive culture and is being treated with antibiotics, which may lead to further infectious complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, neurological status, and laboratory results to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 pleural effusion better today, still R>L
   CTA Chest
   1. No pulmonary embolism is detected.
   2. New pulmonary edema and new moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural
   effusions
   and bibasilar atelectasis.
   3. New moderate atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
   4. Multiple exophytic cystic structures arising from the upper pole of
   the
   left kidney do not have appearance of a simple cyst. Further
   characterization
   of these cysts with MRI is recommended as described in detail in the CT
   of the
   torso of [**2189-3-17**].
   5. Indeterminate left adrenal lesion likely represents adenoma. This
   can
   also be confirmed at the time of MRI examination.
   6. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now
   s/p coiling transferred to MICU service for further management
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received 3 days of
   Ceftriaxone until yesterday ([**2189-3-24**]). It was switched to Vanc and
   zosyn given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA
   done yesterday showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and
   new R>L moderate pleural effusion. Pt was doing better early this
   morning, satting 90-91% on 2.5L O2 NC, then desatted to 80s and had to
   be transitioned to 50% face mask.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Pt is net 2L neg in last 30 hours, with rise in bicarb, indicating
   likely contraction alkalosis. Will not diurese further.
   - Follow CXR
   - Recheck ABG
   - Mobilize pt (not moving much right now due to fatigue), chest PT,
   aggressive incentive spirometry.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - baseline COPD - inhalers prn
   - Goal O2 sat 90-92%, wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Neuro exam stable this morning.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. COPD - continue atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #. FEN - S&S following, recommend PO diet with thin liquids and regular
   solids. Pt continues to complain of food/pills getting stuck in the
   throat
 will f/u with S&S regarding any further recs. PT consult
   placed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #. Hypoxia - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received 3 days of
   Ceftriaxone until yesterday ([**2189-3-24**]). It was switched to Vanc and
   zosyn given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA
   done yesterday showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and
   new R>L moderate pleural effusion. Pt was doing better early this
   morning, satting 90-91% on 2.5L O2 NC, then desatted to 80s and had to
   be transitioned to 50% face mask.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Pt is net 2L neg in last 30 hours, with rise in bicarb, indicating
   likely contraction alkalosis. Will not diurese further.
   - Follow CXR
   - Recheck ABG
   - Mobilize pt (not moving much right now due to fatigue), chest PT,
   aggressive incentive spirometry.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - baseline COPD - inhalers prn
   - Goal O2 sat 90-92%, wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm. She underwent coiling and was transferred to the MICU service for further management. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and continued respiratory distress despite treatment with Ceftriaxone, Vanc, and Zosyn. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed new pulmonary edema, moderate-to-severe bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, iron deficiency, and a possible contraction alkalosis. She has a history of peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She also has a left kidney cyst and an incidental adrenal lesion.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Hypoxia: Continue Vanc and Zosyn for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Mobilize the patient, perform chest physical therapy, and use aggressive incentive spirometry. Consider thoracentesis if the above measures fail to improve symptoms.
2. L PICA aneurysm: Monitor the patient's neuro exam every 4 hours and perform a head CT if there is an acute change.
3. R femoral hematoma: Monitor the patient's hematocrit (HCT) and continue to monitor for any signs of bleeding.
4. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: Continue iron supplementation and transfuse for HCT < 21.
5. COPD: Continue inhalers as needed.
6. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: Obtain an MRI for further characterization in the near future.
7. PVD: Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per neurosurgery recommendations.
8. FEN: Recommend a PO diet with thin liquids and regular solids, and follow up with speech and swallow therapy regarding any further recommendations.
9. PPX: Heparin, bowel regimen, and H2 blocker.
10. Access: L PICC.
11. Code status: Full.
12. Disposition: ICU until respiratory status improves.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's continued respiratory distress and possible HAP may lead to pneumonia.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions may worsen and cause respiratory compromise.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and possible cardiac disease may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's left PICA aneurysm and possible left medullary infarct may lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's R femoral hematoma and possible bleeding complications may worsen and cause hemorrhage.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia and possible bleeding complications may worsen and cause further anemia.
8. Infection: The patient's possible HAP and other infections may worsen and cause sepsis.
9. Nutritional complications: The patient's possible malnutrition and difficulty swallowing may worsen and cause further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic respiratory failure. They were admitted to the ICU with severe bilateral pleural effusions, right middle lobe collapse, and diffuse centrilobular emphysematous changes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 166/50 mmHg. They are receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and are on a diuretic to manage fluid balance.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal electrolyte levels. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin are slightly elevated, and their lactate level is normal. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ARDS may lead to further respiratory compromise, requiring adjustments to their respiratory support and oxygen therapy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusions and emphysematous changes increase their risk of developing pneumonia, which could worsen their respiratory status.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate an underlying septic process, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may increase their risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's diuretic therapy and fluid balance issues may lead to fluid overload, which could worsen their respiratory status and increase their risk of cardiac complications.
6. Worsening of chronic conditions: The patient's chronic respiratory failure, aneurysm, and other comorbidities may worsen over time, requiring adjustments to their treatment plan and potential interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now
   s/p coiling transferred to MICU service for further management
   .
   #. Hypoxia - pt with evidence of small effusions b/l and atelectasis,
   also sputum production with + culture and previous infiltrate
   concerning for PNA.  CXR appears improved this morning, however, the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that was coiled. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 166/50 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has evidence of small effusions bilaterally and atelectasis, with sputum production and a positive culture, suggesting possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and the doctor is considering starting vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
2. Left PICA aneurysm s/p coiling: The patient has a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness, as expected after coiling. The doctor is monitoring the patient's neuro exam every 2 hours and will obtain a head CT if there is an acute neuro change.
3. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on [**3-17**] for a hematocrit (HCT) of 21. The patient's HCT has trended down post-procedure, and the doctor is continuing iron supplementation and monitoring the patient's HCT.
4. COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is receiving inhalers as needed.
5. PVD s/p SMA stenting: The patient has peripheral vascular disease and had a stenting procedure on [**8-15**]. The doctor is planning to restart plavix and ASA once the patient is stable for neurosurgical purposes.
6. FEN: The patient has a feeding tube (FEN) and is being recommended a diet with thin liquids and regular solids.
7. PPX: The patient has a prophylactic heparin regimen and a bowel regimen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 25.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 451 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 34 mmHg
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* Computed tomography (CT) chest: No pulmonary embolism (PE)
* CT head: Stable

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/tazobactam
* Lasix
* Diltiazem
* Morphine sulfate
* Heparin sodium
* Famotidine
* Prophylactic antibiotics

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia (PNA)
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
3. Left-sided weakness
4. Acute blood loss anemia
5. Respiratory failure
6. Sepsis
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
8. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
9. COPD exacerbation
10. Iron deficiency anemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Starting vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible HAP
2. CTA chest for possible PE
3. Encouraging incentive spirometry
4. Maintaining SpO2 between 92-94%
5. Weaning oxygen as tolerated
6. Baseline COPD treatment
7. Monitoring neuro exam every 2 hours
8. Head CT if acute neuro change
9. F/u neurosurgical recommendations
10. Continuing iron supplementation
11. Following HCT and transfusing for HCT < 21
12. Obtaining OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
13. Restarting plavix and ASA once stable for neurosurgical purposes
14. Recommending PO diet with thin liquids and regular solids
15. Continuing prophylactic heparin regimen and bowel regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was coiled. She has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and sputum production with a positive culture, suggesting pneumonia. She was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has a left femoral hematoma, which is stable, and a history of severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia. She has been receiving transfusions and iron supplements.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she may require reintubation for respiratory fatigue.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive culture and is receiving antibiotics, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient has severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, which may lead to worsening anemia and potential complications such as cardiac arrest.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a left femoral hematoma, which may continue to bleed and cause complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a left medullary infarct due to the coiling of the PICA aneurysm, which may lead to neurological deficits and potential complications such as stroke.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of PVD and hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for HAP and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider reintubation if necessary.
3. Continue transfusions and iron supplements to manage anemia.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding and hematoma size, and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
7. Consider further imaging to rule out other potential complications, such as PE or COPD flare."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm, which was coiled, and now transferred to the MICU service for further management. She has a history of PVD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia. She has developed severe bilateral pleural effusions, right middle lobe collapse, and diffuse centrilobular emphysematous changes. She has also been experiencing tachycardia and hypertension, for which she has been prescribed Dilt 30 mg QID PO. Her sputum culture has grown Moraxella and D3 ceftriaxone was started, but she has been in the hospital for over a week. She has developed acute blood loss anemia and is receiving iron supplements. She has a history of COPD and PVD, and her neuro exam is stable, but she is expected to have a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and she may require reintubation for respiratory fatigue.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture has grown Moraxella, and she has developed bilateral pleural effusions, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and her urine output is decreasing, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is severe, and she may require further transfusions.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's expected left medullary infarct may lead to neurological complications such as weakness, numbness, or paralysis.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory status and sputum culture may indicate an infection, which may spread to other parts of the body.
8. Bleeding: The patient's history of PVD and SMA stenting may increase her risk of bleeding, especially in the context of anticoagulation therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for possible HAP and pneumonia.
2. Perform a CTA chest to rule out PE.
3. Consider starting steroids for COPD flare if the patient fails to improve with antibiotics.
4. Encourage incentive spirometry and wean O2 as tolerated.
5. Monitor the patient's neuro exam every 2 hours and perform head CT if there is any acute change.
6. Continue iron supplements and monitor the patient's HCT.
7. Consider transfusing the patient for HCT < 21.
8. Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy.
9. Restart plavix and ASA once the patient is stable for neurosurgical standpoint.
10. Continue PO diet with thin liquids and regular solids.
11. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust therapy as necessary.
12. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures."

   Imaging: CT--with emphysema pleural effusions RML and bilateral LL
   collapse, mild pulmonary edema
   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with persistent post operative hypoxemia--this appears to
   be largely related to multiple challenges to effective gas
   exchange--this is attributable to unerlying COPD in addition to post
   operative atelectasis, bilteral pleural effusions and strong suggestion
   of pulmonary edema in this setting all have combined to create
   intermittent and significant hypoxemia
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   1)S/P cerebral artery embolization-
   -ASA/Plavix
   2)Hypoxemia
Multifactorial and dominant feature is the basilar
   atelectasis in the setting of apical lung tissue destruction from COPD
   driving hypoxemia.  On exam
bronchospasm does appear to be less likely.
   -Broad ABX
Vanco/Zosyn
   -No PE seen
   -Maintain even fluid balance in the setting of bilateral pleural
   effusions
she is not clearly volume overloaded and in fact is overall
   negative throughout hospital stay
   -She needs increased ambulation and movement and pain control and do
   incentive spirometry
   -No wheezes and no role for steroid therapy systemically

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   collapse, mild pulmonary edema
   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with persistent post operative hypoxemia--this appears to
   be largely related to multiple challenges to effective gas
   exchange--this is attributable to unerlying COPD in addition to post
   operative atelectasis, bilteral pleural effusions and strong suggestion
   of pulmonary edema in this setting all have combined to create
   intermittent and significant hypoxemia
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   1)S/P cerebral artery embolization-
   -ASA/Plavix
   2)Hypoxemia
Multifactorial and dominant feature is the basilar
   atelectasis in the setting of apical lung tissue destruction from COPD
   driving hypoxemia.  On exam
bronchospasm does appear to be less likely.
   -Broad ABX

   -No PE seen
   -Maintain even fluid balance in the setting of bilateral pleural

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who underwent cerebral artery embolization and is currently in the ICU due to persistent post-operative hypoxemia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is contributing to the hypoxemia. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and mild pulmonary edema, which are further complicating her respiratory status. The patient is receiving antibiotics, diuretics, and pain management, and is being monitored closely for respiratory failure and other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory failure are the primary concerns. The patient's underlying COPD and post-operative atelectasis are contributing factors, and the patient may require mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's antibiotics and diuretics may help to treat any underlying pneumonia, but the patient's respiratory status and risk of developing pneumonia are high.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's mild pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential cardiac complications.
4. Pleural Effusions: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions may require drainage or other interventions to prevent further respiratory compromise.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac tamponade, need to be monitored closely.
6. Infection: The patient's antibiotics and diuretics may help to treat any underlying infections, but the patient's risk of developing infection is high, particularly with the presence of a central line and other invasive devices.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and potential bleeding complications, such as hematemesis or melena, need to be monitored closely.
8. Pain Management: The patient's acute and chronic pain need to be managed effectively to prevent further respiratory compromise and other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR. Had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which
   responded to acetazolamide x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis
   likely due, at least in part, to contraction, though only received
   lasix x1 on [**3-24**]. Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Neuro exam stable this morning. Unable to read yesterday,
   which per patient is new. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate
   when patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR. Had severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which
   responded to acetazolamide x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis
   likely due, at least in part, to contraction, though only received
   lasix x1 on [**3-24**]. Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Neuro exam stable this morning. Unable to read yesterday,
   which per patient is new. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate
   when patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which was coiled. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, severe metabolic alkalosis, and possible aspiration pneumonia. She has been treated with antibiotics, including Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin, and has been intubated for persistent hypoxia.

The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 226 mmHg on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 36 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 35 mmol/L.

The patient's neurological examination is stable, with a mild left facial droop and decreased left finger flexion. Her left lower extremity (LE) hip flexion and ankle flexion are 4+ and 5+, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet (Plt) count of 36 x 10^9/L. Her serum creatinine (Cr) level is 0.6 mg/dL, and her serum lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires intubation for persistent hypoxia. She may require further respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has been intubated, and she has evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow. She may be at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has severe metabolic alkalosis, which may be due to contraction alkalosis, respiratory alkalosis, or both. She may require further treatment to correct this condition.
4. Left medullary infarct: The patient has a history of coiling a large left proximal PICA aneurysm, which may have caused a left medullary infarct. She may be at risk for developing neurological deficits.
5. R femoral hematoma: The patient has a R femoral hematoma, which may be at risk for bleeding or infection.
6. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: The patient has severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia, which may require further treatment, including blood transfusions.
7. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: The patient has left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. PVD s/p SMA stenting: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and has undergone stenting of the superficial femoral artery (SFA). She may be at risk for developing complications related to her PVD.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, metabolic alkalosis, left medullary infarct, R femoral hematoma, severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia, left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma, and PVD s/p SMA stenting. She requires close monitoring and further treatment to manage her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown value, admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated significantly, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 113 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, and a base excess (BE) of -8 mmol/L. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99% on a FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient has a history of aspiration, with an episode of silent aspiration while drinking barium during a barium swallow study. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 400-507 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14-22 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse upper airway sounds, decreased breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, and a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.9-11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.1-7.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 36-35 K/uL, and creatinine (Cr) of 0.6-0.5 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. 

The patient's medical history includes a history of chronic respiratory failure, aneurysm, and impaired balance, motor function, posture, and knowledge. 

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, chronic pain, acute pain, and impaired pain control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the risk of respiratory failure is high. 

2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and the presence of coarse upper airway sounds increase the risk of pneumonia. 

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP. 

4. Sepsis: The patient's history of aspiration and the presence of thick white fluid in the airway increase the risk of sepsis. 

5. Bleeding: The patient's history of aneurysm and the presence of a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin increase the risk of bleeding. 

6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's history of aneurysm and the presence of a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin increase the risk of DIC. 

7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of aneurysm and the presence of a small hematoma with bruit in the right groin increase the risk of cardiac complications. 

8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of impaired balance, motor function, posture, and knowledge increase the risk of neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis likely due, at least in
   part, to contraction, though only received lasix x1 on [**3-24**].
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Obtain Dead Space Calculation
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/Sw eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume. Alkalosis likely due, at least in
   part, to contraction, though only received lasix x1 on [**3-24**].
   - Consider bronch today for BAL +/- biopsy of RML node.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Obtain Dead Space Calculation
   - Pulm edema and pleural effusion are not felt to be severe enough to
   cause the hypoxia that pt is experiencing.
   - Consider thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in
   symptoms.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/Sw eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD, who was admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was treated with coiling. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient has developed severe respiratory failure, with a sputum culture growing Moraxella. She was treated with Ceftriaxone for 3 days, but it was switched to Vanc/Zosyn due to continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. A CTA showed new pulmonary edema, moderate pleural effusion, and a 8mm node causing right middle lobe collapse.

The patient has also developed severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide and a decrease in tidal volume. She has been intubated due to persistent hypoxia and has evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a sputum culture growing Moraxella, and the respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
2. HAP: The patient has been treated with Vanc/Zosyn for possible HAP, and the sputum culture growing Moraxella supports this diagnosis.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient has evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow, which can lead to pneumonitis.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient has developed new pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory distress.
5. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate pleural effusion, which can also worsen her respiratory distress.
6. Atelectasis: The patient has evidence of atelectasis, which can worsen her respiratory distress.
7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has developed severe metabolic alkalosis, which can be life-threatening if not treated.
8. Left-sided weakness: The patient has a left medullary infarct due to the PICA aneurysm, which can cause left-sided weakness.
9. R femoral hematoma: The patient has a R femoral hematoma, which can worsen her respiratory distress and increase her risk of bleeding.
10. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: The patient has received 2U PRBC and is at risk of developing severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia.
11. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: The patient has incidental findings on CT, which may require further evaluation with MRI.
12. PVD s/p SMA stenting: The patient has a history of PVD, which can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
13. FEN: The patient has an NG tube, which can increase her risk of aspiration and respiratory complications.
14. Anxiety/Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is at risk of developing anxiety and depression during this admission.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vanc/Zosyn for possible HAP
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis
* Xanex for anxiety
* Plavix and ASA for PVD
* Iron supplements for severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   .
   #. FEN

   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

   atelectatic airspaces
   - check urine chloride to evaluate for cause of metabolic alkalosis
   - start tube feeds; will hold after midnight if anticipating extubation
   in the morning.
   - will repeat head CT per neurosurg recs to check for stability.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD,
   HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA
   aneurysm now s/p coiling transferred to MICU for hypoxia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.

   Patient seen and examined with MSIV and the rest of the MICU team.
   - Patient was intubated overnight due to worsening respiratory
   distress.  Will bronch today to further evaluate for causative
   organism; Trial pressure support and increase PEEP on vent to recruit
   atelectatic airspaces
   - check urine chloride to evaluate for cause of metabolic alkalosis
   - start tube feeds; will hold after midnight if anticipating extubation
   in the morning.
   - will repeat head CT per neurosurg recs to check for stability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm that was coiled. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, and she required intubation due to persistent hypoxia on non-rebreather mask (NRBR). The sputum culture grew Moraxella, and she received 3 days of ceftriaxone until it was switched to vancomycin and Zosyn due to continued respiratory distress and concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient has severe metabolic alkalosis, likely multifactorial, with elements of contraction alkalosis in the setting of diuresis and poor oral intake, as well as COPD and pneumonia with elevated pCO2 and compensatory HCO3 over the past week. The differential diagnosis also includes hyperaldosteronism. The goal is to maintain pCO2 50-55 and HCO3 30 while intubated.

The patient has a left PICA aneurysm that was coiled, and she is expected to have a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness. The neuro exam is stable, and the patient is being monitored for any acute neuro changes.

The patient has a right femoral hematoma that is stable, and she is being monitored for any changes. She also has severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, which was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She will continue to receive iron supplements and will be transfused if her hemoglobin drops below 21.

The patient has left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma that need further characterization with an MRI in the near future.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and has undergone stenting of the superficial femoral artery. She will continue to receive plavix and aspirin as recommended by the neurosurgeon.

The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking xanex 0.5mg at home. She will require a social work and/or psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. She may also be started on citalopram empirically.

The patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube and will start tube feeds today. She will need a repeat swallow evaluation after extubation due to evidence of aspiration. Her electrolytes will be repleted as needed.

The patient has a peripheral IV line and an arterial line. She will continue to receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and bone disease.
3. Left-sided weakness: The patient's left-sided weakness may worsen if the left medullary infarct progresses, leading to potential complications such as urinary retention, constipation, and difficulty with ambulation.
4. Right femoral hematoma: The patient's right femoral hematoma may worsen if not properly managed, leading to potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and compartment syndrome.
5. Severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to potential complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: The patient's left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma may require further evaluation and treatment, potentially leading to complications such as bleeding, infection, and hormonal imbalances.
7. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to potential complications such as limb ischemia, gangrene, and amputation.
8. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen if not properly managed, leading to potential complications such as suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and decreased quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, chronic balance impairment, impaired motor function, impaired posture, and impaired knowledge. The patient is also experiencing acute and chronic pain.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (72-97 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 160/63 mmHg (96/125-174/63 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute (14-23 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, famotidine for acid reflux, and piperacillin/tazobactam for infection.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL

   Imaging: CXR-Bilateral pleural effusions, persistent and collapse
   noted, barium seen in left lower lobe airways.
   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with history of COPD and now post procedure from coiling
   of CNS aneurysm and now with persistent and recurrent hypoxemia
   resulting in respiratory failure. She has a contribution from her
   underlying COPD and destructive lung disease dominant at apex
which is
   clearly seen on CT.  Following barium swallow
patient had likely
   aspiration (supported by CXR findings and clinical scenario) and with
   inability to clear secretions she has had further obstruction and loss
   of capacity to ventilate lower lobe areas contributing to further
   hypoxemia and ineffective ventilation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Source as above
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy today for clearance of airway secretions
   -Increase PEEP to 10 and will look to recruit basilar lung units
   -Thoracentesis has been considered but with relatively small effusions
   and in the setting of positive airway pressure there is some risk for
   thoracentesis and pneumothorax but if re-expansion incomplete following
   bronch will have to consider thoracentesis
   2)S/P Embolization-
   -Follow exam
   -Some stable changes with unilateral weakness noted as persistent
   3)Metabolic Alkalosis-
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be manifestation of increased effective ventilation in the setting
   of previous chronic resp failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with history of COPD and now post procedure from coiling
   of CNS aneurysm and now with persistent and recurrent hypoxemia
   resulting in respiratory failure. She has a contribution from her
   underlying COPD and destructive lung disease dominant at apex
which is
   clearly seen on CT.  Following barium swallow
patient had likely
   aspiration (supported by CXR findings and clinical scenario) and with
   inability to clear secretions she has had further obstruction and loss
   of capacity to ventilate lower lobe areas contributing to further
   hypoxemia and ineffective ventilation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Source as above
   -Will pursue bronchoscopy today for clearance of airway secretions
   -Increase PEEP to 10 and will look to recruit basilar lung units
   -Thoracentesis has been considered but with relatively small effusions
   and in the setting of positive airway pressure there is some risk for
   thoracentesis and pneumothorax but if re-expansion incomplete following
   bronch will have to consider thoracentesis
   2)S/P Embolization-
   -Follow exam
   -Some stable changes with unilateral weakness noted as persistent
   3)Metabolic Alkalosis-
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be manifestation of increased effective ventilation in the setting
   of previous chronic resp failure.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who underwent coiling of a CNS aneurysm and is currently in respiratory failure. She has persistent and recurrent hypoxemia, which is contributing to her respiratory failure. The patient has a history of aspiration, which is likely contributing to her ongoing respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 152/60 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 50% FiO2. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 36,000. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.4 mmol/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral pleural effusions, persistent and collapse noted, and barium seen in the left lower lobe airways.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Aspiration: The patient's history of aspiration and ongoing respiratory distress increase the risk of further aspiration.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration increase the risk of developing sepsis.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing metabolic alkalosis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and cerebral edema.
8. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration increase the risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
9. Hemorrhage: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of hemorrhage, such as bleeding from the airway or gastrointestinal tract.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and providing supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and bronchoscopy to clear airway secretions."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - monitor neuro exam q4hrs (check with NSG); head CT if acute neuro
   change
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm and was s/p coiling.

The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and severe metabolic alkalosis. She was intubated due to persistent hypoxia on non-rebreather mask (NRBR) and required bronchoscopy for BAL and deep suction. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a tidal volume of 479 mL.

The patient has also been experiencing a severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, which was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on [**3-17**]. She is currently receiving iron supplements and has a stable hemoglobin level.

The patient has a history of left PICA aneurysm s/p coiling and is expected to have a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness. The patient's neuro exam is stable, and she will be monitored every 4 hours. The patient's R femoral hematoma is stable, and she will continue to monitor her hemoglobin level.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to complications such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, or respiratory failure.
3. Left medullary infarct: The patient's left medullary infarct may worsen, leading to left-sided weakness or other neurological complications.
4. R femoral hematoma: The patient's R femoral hematoma may worsen, leading to bleeding or other complications.
5. Severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other complications.
6. HAP: The patient's HAP may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
7. Pneumonitis: The patient's pneumonitis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
8. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient's pseudomonal pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
9. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to renal failure or other complications.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Bronchoscopy for BAL and deep suction.
2. Increase PEEP to 10-19 cmH2O to recruit atelectatic airways.
3. Trial PSV after bronchoscopy.
4. Follow-up CXR.
5. Serial ABG.
6. Continue vanc and zosyn for possible HAP.
7. Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to bring improvement in respiratory function.
8. Monitor urine chloride levels to rule out hyperaldosteronism.
9. Monitor ABGs to ensure metabolic alkalosis is being managed.
10. Continue iron supplements and monitor hemoglobin levels.
11. Restart plavix and ASA per neurosurgery recommendations.
12. Obtain nutrition consult and start tube feeds.
13. Monitor neuro exam every 4 hours and obtain head CT if acute neuro change is noted.
14. Monitor R femoral hematoma and continue to monitor hemoglobin levels.
15. Consider starting citalopram empirically for depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with respiratory failure, chronic, and impaired motor function, posture, and knowledge. The patient is intubated and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal tube, ventilator mode CPAP/PSV, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show normal electrolyte levels, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. The patient's hemoglobin and platelet count are within normal limits. The patient's medical history is significant for an aneurysm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the patient may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired motor function and posture may increase the risk of developing pneumonia, and the patient's respiratory support may need to be adjusted to prevent aspiration.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein may indicate an infection, and the patient's antibiotics may need to be adjusted or added to prevent sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, and the patient's bleeding risk may be increased. The patient's blood products may need to be monitored and adjusted to prevent bleeding.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's aneurysm and impaired motor function may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's impaired motor function and posture may make it difficult to maintain adequate nutrition, and the patient's nutritional support may need to be adjusted.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's impaired motor function and posture may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired motor function and posture may increase the risk of skin breakdown, and the patient's skin may need to be monitored and protected to prevent pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's respiratory status has been stable, with a tidal volume of 479 mL and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, and their ABG reveals a pH of 7.46, pCO2 of 45 mmHg, and pO2 of 200 mmHg.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 120/48 mmHg and a heart rate of 96 beats per minute. Their central venous pressure is not assessed, and their peripheral vascular examination is limited due to the patient's inability to move.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 25.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 373 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, and chloride level of 31 mEq/L. Their liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 13 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 8 IU/L.

The patient's nutritional status is being supported with Nutren Pulmonary at a rate of 35 mL/hour. Their glycemic control is being monitored, and their lines are in place for arterial and central venous access.

The patient's comorbidities include chronic respiratory failure, impaired balance, and impaired motor function. They are also at risk for acute and chronic pain, as well as aneurysm rupture.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure puts them at risk for worsening respiratory status, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's impaired immune function and chronic respiratory failure make them susceptible to sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired respiratory function and chronic respiratory failure increase their risk of developing pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobilization and chronic respiratory failure increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
5. Aneurysm rupture: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and impaired blood pressure control increase their risk of aneurysm rupture, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and impaired blood pressure control increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and impaired blood pressure control increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and death.
8. Liver failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and impaired liver function increase their risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy and death.

In conclusion, this patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status to prevent potential complications and improve their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.
   - Follow CXR.
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - F/U urine chloride
   - Monitor ABGs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Bronch today for BAL for gram stain/cx, deep suction.
   - Increase PEEP to [**10-19**] to recruit atelectatic airways, along as O2
   Sats are maintained
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which was coiled. She developed hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis caused by barium aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 120/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Blood glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 373 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Sodium: 134 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.4 mEq/L
* Chloride: 31 mEq/L
* Bicarbonate: 25.5 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia
* Left PICA aneurysm s/p coiling with expected left medullary infarct and left-sided weakness
* Right femoral hematoma
* Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) s/p SMA stenting

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis
* Famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Acetazolamide for severe metabolic alkalosis
* Iron supplementation for severe iron deficiency
* Plavix and aspirin for PVD

The patient's plan includes:

* Bronchoscopy for BAL and deep suction
* Increase PEEP to 10-19 cmH2O to recruit atelectatic airways
* Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely to be extubated tomorrow
* Follow-up chest X-ray and serial ABG
* Continue vancomycin and Zosyn for possible HAP
* Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if respiratory function does not improve
* Monitor urine chloride levels to rule out hyperaldosteronism
* Follow-up neuro examination and head CT if acute neuro changes occur
* Continue iron supplementation and transfusion for HCT < 21
* Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
* Restart plavix and ASA for PVD
* Consider starting citalopram empirically for anxiety/depression
* Start tube feeds and obtain nutrition consult
* Repeat S/SW evaluation after extubation

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to atelectasis, pneumonia, or pneumonitis
* Metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis, poor PO intake, or hyperaldosteronism
* Left-sided weakness or paralysis due to left medullary infarct
* Right femoral hematoma bleeding or infection
* Iron deficiency or anemia due to inadequate supplementation or bleeding
* Hyperkalemia or hypokalemia due to potassium imbalance
* Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia due to calcium imbalance
* Hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia due to magnesium imbalance
* Hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia due to phosphate imbalance
* Pneumonia or sepsis due to hospital-acquired infections
* Anxiety or depression due to hospitalization and medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to extubate
   - Trial PSV after bronchoscopy, likely will be extubated soon
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HAP day 4 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   - Consider bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the above fail to
   bring improvement in respiratory function.
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Likely multifactorial: Element of contraction
   alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for several days,
   plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3 over past week.
   Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will check Urine lytes
   (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55,
   HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Will discuss with neurosurg and reevaluate when
   patient not sedated.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs
   - NS signed off, no new changes
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - incidental finding on CT.
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Restarted plavix and ASA yesterday per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN

   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a past medical history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which was coiled, and subsequently developed hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 479 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is 120/48 mmHg, and her heart rate is 96 beats per minute.
* Metabolic status: The patient has severe metabolic alkalosis, which is likely multifactorial, and is being treated with acetazolamide and adjustments to her tidal volume.
* Neurological status: The patient has a left-sided weakness due to a left medullary infarct, which is expected given her aneurysm coiling procedure.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving tube feeds. She has evidence of silent aspiration on barium swallow and is at risk for further aspiration.
* Hematological status: The patient has severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, which is being treated with iron supplements and blood transfusions as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she is at risk for further respiratory distress due to her underlying COPD, pneumonia, and aspiration.
* Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's severe metabolic alkalosis requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and nephracalcinosis.
* Neurological complications: The patient's left-sided weakness and expected left medullary infarct require close monitoring for potential neurological decline.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's risk for further aspiration and potential gastrointestinal bleeding requires close monitoring and treatment.
* Hematological complications: The patient's severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia require close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications such as cardiovascular events and infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Decreasing the peak inspiratory pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure to attempt extubation.
* Trial of pressure support ventilation after bronchoscopy.
* Follow-up chest X-ray to assess for any changes in lung status.
* Serial arterial blood gas analysis to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
* Continued treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.
* Consideration of bilateral therapeutic thoracentesis if the patient's respiratory function does not improve.
* Monitoring of the patient's metabolic alkalosis and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and potential neurological decline.
* Close monitoring of the patient's gastrointestinal status and potential gastrointestinal complications.
* Close monitoring of the patient's hematological status and potential hematological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female with initial admission for coiling of cerebral aneurysm
   and now post procedure course compliacted by recurrent respiratory
   failure with atelectasis and aspiration driving acute need for
   re-intubation.  She has been supported with PSV with good tolerance of
   minimal support settings.  The concern at this point is that patient
   has some low grade fever noted and mild increase in WBC count.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue Atrovent
   -Continue Vanco and will re-dose by trough/Zosyn
   -Will need to move to PSV 5/5 this morning and if favorable would move
   to SBT x 30 minutes and extubation.
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Repeat CXR to be completed with trial on [**5-12**]
   -Hope to move to extubation today.
   -With continued decreased motivation and suggestion of depressed mood
   will have to consider Ritalin or other simulants to aid in stimulation
   of patient participation in care.
   2)CNS Aneurysm/S/P coiling-
   -Plavix
   -ASA to continue

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted for coiling of a cerebral aneurysm and is currently in the post-procedure course. She has developed recurrent respiratory failure with atelectasis and aspiration, requiring re-intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PSV 10/10 at 40% FiO2.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/47 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has a history of coiling of a cerebral aneurysm and has undergone the procedure. She has developed respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. The patient has also developed atelectasis and aspiration, which is contributing to her respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show an increase in white blood cell count and a mild increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her renal function is normal.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing mechanical ventilation with PSV 10/10 at 40% FiO2, re-dosing antibiotics, and repeating a chest x-ray. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of aspiration and atelectasis, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cerebral aneurysm coiling may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cerebral aneurysm coiling may also increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's increased white blood cell count and mild increase in LDH may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and managed.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance data shows a positive balance, which may indicate fluid overload, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm now post-coiling and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly, with a decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in oxygen saturation. However, she remains intubated due to persistent hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, and she is being monitored for signs of hyperaldosteronism.

The patient's neurological status has also improved, with a stable neuro exam and no new findings. However, she is expected to have a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness due to the coiling of the PICA aneurysm.

The patient's blood count is stable, with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL and a platelet count of 114,000/mm3. Her electrolyte levels are also stable, with a sodium level of 134 mmol/L and a potassium level of 3.4 mmol/L.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be monitored and managed, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to persistent hypoxia and respiratory distress. She has a moderate pleural effusion and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis has resolved, but she is being monitored for signs of hyperaldosteronism.
3. Left medullary infarct: The patient is expected to have a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness due to the coiling of the PICA aneurysm.
4. Severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia: The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being monitored for signs of anemia.
5. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: The patient has left kidney cysts and a left adrenal incidentaloma that need to be further characterized with an MRI.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic alkalosis and monitor for signs of hyperaldosteronism.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her care plan as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood count and electrolyte levels and adjust her care plan as needed.
5. Obtain an MRI to further characterize the patient's left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma.
6. Continue to manage the patient's severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia and monitor for signs of anemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's left medullary infarct and adjust her care plan as needed.
8. Consider starting citalopram empirically for depression.
9. Obtain a nutrition consult to develop a plan for tube feeds.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's access lines and adjust her care plan as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she has several medical complications that need to be monitored and managed."

   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

* 66-year-old female admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm, now s/p coiling
* PMH includes PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD
* Currently intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxia
* Sputum culture grew Moraxella, and patient received 3 days of Ceftriaxone, then switched to Vanc/Zosyn due to continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP
* CT scan showed new pulmonary edema, moderate pleural effusion, and 8mm node causing RML collapse
* Patient has severe iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia, received 2U PRBC, and is being treated with iron supplements
* Patient has left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma, and needs MRI for further characterization
* Patient has a history of SMA stenting and is being treated with Plavix and ASA
* Patient is also experiencing anxiety/depression and may require social work or psychiatry consult when extubated

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: patient's respiratory distress may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory acidosis
* Pneumonia: patient's sputum culture grew Moraxella, and patient is at risk for developing pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and sepsis
* Metabolic alkalosis: patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias
* Left-sided weakness: patient's left-sided weakness may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias
* Iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia: patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function
* Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: patient's cysts and incidentaloma may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as kidney damage and adrenal insufficiency
* Anxiety/depression: patient's anxiety/depression may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as decreased quality of life, increased risk of falls, and decreased ability to manage medical care

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status, manage her metabolic alkalosis, and address her anxiety/depression. Additionally, the patient's iron deficiency/acute blood loss anemia should be closely monitored, and the patient's left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma should be further characterized with an MRI."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU patient with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, chronic aneurysm, and impaired motor function. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/54 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, and their respiratory rate is 12 inspirations per minute.

The patient has received several medications, including propofol, famotidine, and vancomycin, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 377 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 134 mEq/L and a potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their impaired motor function, and their neurological examination is also impaired due to their respiratory failure. The patient's pain control is being managed with acetaminophen and morphine.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if they do not receive adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's impaired immune function and presence of antibiotics can increase their risk of developing sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation can increase their risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Vascular complications: The patient's chronic aneurysm and presence of arterial and venous lines can increase their risk of developing vascular complications, such as bleeding or thrombosis.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's impaired motor function and neurological examination can increase their risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Wound complications: The patient's impaired motor function and presence of lines and drains can increase their risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
7. Pain management: The patient's impaired motor function and neurological examination can make it challenging to manage their pain effectively.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's impaired motor function and presence of lines and drains can increase their risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 66-year-old female with respiratory failure, admitted to the ICU due to persistent respiratory compromise. She was extubated, but the cuff leak was absent, and there was concern for upper airway edema and obstruction. Decadron was administered, which rapidly resolved the issue. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a SpO2 of 95%, and her respiratory support is being managed with CPAP/PSV. She is receiving antibiotics, and her laboratory results show mild elevation in creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise is a significant concern, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Upper airway edema and obstruction: Although the issue has been resolved with decadron administration, there is still a risk of recurrence, which could lead to airway obstruction and respiratory failure.
3. Secretion clearance: The patient's airway secretions need to be closely monitored and aided with physical therapy to prevent atelectasis and respiratory compromise.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the risk of infection persists, particularly given her respiratory compromise and the presence of invasive lines.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which could lead to fluid overload and exacerbate her respiratory compromise.
6. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases her risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are mildly elevated, which could lead to hyperglycemic complications if not managed appropriately.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are mildly elevated, which could indicate early signs of renal insufficiency, potentially requiring further evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression
   .
   #. FEN
 NG tube. Will start tube feeds today and obtain nutrition
   consult. Will need repeat S/SW eval after extubation given evidence of
   aspiration. Replete lytes prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs

   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, which was treated with coiling. She developed respiratory distress and was intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: She is intubated and on invasive ventilation. Her respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration.
* Metabolic alkalosis: Resolved, likely multifactorial, with elements of contraction alkalosis, diuresis, and poor PO intake.
* Left PICA aneurysm: She has a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness, as expected.
* R femoral hematoma: Stable, with no evidence of aneurysm or fistula.
* Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia: She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is currently stable.
* Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: Needs further characterization with MRI.
* PVD: She has a bare metal stent in her superficial femoral artery (SFA) and is taking clopidogrel and aspirin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory distress and aspiration of barium, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
* Atelectasis: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may lead to atelectasis, which can worsen her respiratory status.
* Metabolic acidosis: If the patient's metabolic alkalosis resolves, there is a risk of developing metabolic acidosis, particularly if she has inadequate PO intake or ongoing acid production.
* Left-sided weakness: The patient's left medullary infarct may lead to persistent left-sided weakness, which could impact her mobility and overall functional status.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's R femoral hematoma may continue to bleed or expand, leading to further complications.
* Infection: The patient's PICA aneurysm and recent coiling procedure may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly if she develops a wound infection or sepsis.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's PVD and recent SMA stenting may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue invasive ventilation and wean as tolerated.
* Monitor for signs of pneumonia and atelectasis.
* Follow-up with serial ABG and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Continue steroids and antibiotics for possible HAP.
* Monitor for signs of metabolic acidosis and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Continue to manage the patient's left-sided weakness and consider physical therapy to improve her mobility.
* Monitor the patient's R femoral hematoma and consider further imaging to rule out aneurysm or fistula.
* Continue to manage the patient's severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia and consider further transfusions as needed.
* Consider MRI for further characterization of the patient's left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma.
* Continue to manage the patient's PVD and consider further interventions as needed.
* Consider social work and psychiatry consults to address the patient's anxiety and depression.
* Consider starting tube feeds and obtaining nutrition consult.
* Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's lines and access sites, and consider removing the PICC line and A-line as tolerated."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide x1 and
   decrease in tidal volume.  Now successfully extubated with a cuff
   leak.  Steroids for airway edema stopped.   Oxygen weaned down
   overnight.
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Urine
   lytes (Cl- specifically) consistent with dehydration.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**].  Repeat head CT on [**3-26**] unchanged.  Neurosurg signed off
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg

   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis, which responded to acetazolamide x1 and
   decrease in tidal volume.  Now successfully extubated with a cuff
   leak.  Steroids for airway edema stopped.   Oxygen weaned down
   overnight.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm, now post-coiling. She has a history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. She developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation, and was treated with antibiotics for possible HAP. She has a severe iron deficiency and acute blood loss anemia, requiring PRBC transfusions. She also has a left kidney cyst and left adrenal incidentaloma, which require further characterization. The patient has a history of depression and anxiety and may require social work and/or psychiatry consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis caused by barium aspiration.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may persist or recur due to poor PO intake, COPD/PNA, and hyperaldosteronism.
3. Left Medullary Infarct: The patient's left medullary infarct may worsen or lead to new neurological deficits due to the left PICA aneurysm.
4. R Femoral Hematoma: The patient's R femoral hematoma may worsen or lead to further bleeding due to the aneurysm.
5. Severe Iron Deficiency/Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen or lead to further complications due to poor iron intake and inadequate PRBC transfusions.
6. Left Kidney Cysts and Left Adrenal Incidentaloma: The patient's left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma may require further characterization and monitoring for potential complications.
7. PVD s/p SMA Stenting: The patient's PVD may worsen or lead to further complications due to the bare metal stent.
8. Anxiety/Depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen or lead to further complications due to the stress of her condition and the need for social work and/or psychiatry consultation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic alkalosis with acetazolamide and close monitoring of ABGs.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as needed for the left medullary infarct.
4. Monitor the patient's R femoral hematoma and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further bleeding.
5. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with iron supplements and PRBC transfusions as needed.
6. Schedule an MRI to further characterize the left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's PVD and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Consider starting citalopram empirically for the patient's anxiety and depression, and schedule a social work and/or psychiatry consultation as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 66y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm now s/p coiling
   transferred to MICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Sputum culture grew Moraxella and pt received
   3 days of Ceftriaxone until [**2189-3-24**]. It was switched to Vanc/Zosyn
   given her continued respiratory distress and concern for HAP. CTA done
   [**3-25**] showing new pulm edema (although not impressive), and new R>L
   moderate pleural effusion.  CT also mentions 8mm node causing RML
   collapse. Pt on 5L NC most of yesterday, had evidence of silent
   aspiration on barium swallow, required intubation for persistent
   hypoxia on NRBR.  Respiratory distress likely due to combination of
   atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD (with possible increased dead
   space ventilation), and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. Had
   severe metabolic alkalosis overnight, which responded to acetazolamide
   x1 and decrease in tidal volume.
   - Attempt to extubated today, no cuff leak yesterday or this AM, but
   steroids started and 8.0 ETT is large for a small patient
   - D/c steroids at 24 hrs
   - Follow CXR - stable
   - Serial ABG.
   - Continue vanc & zosyn for possible HCAP day 5 (Day 1=[**2189-3-24**])
   duration 14 days
   - While intubated, goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30
   .
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis
 Resolved. Likely multifactorial: Element of
   contraction alkalosis in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake for
   several days, plus COPD/PNA with elevated pC02 and compensatory HCO3
   over past week. Differential also includes hyperaldosteronism. Will
   check Urine lytes (Cl- specifically) to rule this out. While intubated,
   goal pCO2 50-55, HCO3 30.
   - Improving, will bolus as needed
   - Monitor ABGs
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - per neurosurgery patient now with
   expected left medullary infarct w/ left sided weakness. CT head stable
   on [**3-22**]. Unable to read yesterday, which per patient is new, but neuro
   exam otherwise stable. Repeat Head CT unchanged.
   - no need to limit BP control currently per NSG recs, NS signed off
   .
   #. R femoral hematoma - US without evidence of aneurysm or fistula,
   stable
   - continue to monitor HCT
 now stable
   .
   #. Severe iron deficiency/Acute Blood Loss anemia - received 2U PRBC on
   [**3-17**] for HCT 21, trended down post-procedure with evidence of R groin
   hematoma, now stable
   - Continue iron  - increased to TID
   - Follow HCT, transfuse for HCT < 21
   - Obtain OSH records of EGD and colonoscopy
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma
   - needs MRI for further characterization sometime in near future
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**] - bare metal stent
   - Cont plavix and ASA per NSurg
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression
 On xanex 0.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] at home. Pt has PMHx of
   depression but not currently on medications. Significant nursing and
   family concern for depression during this admission. Likely will need
   social work +/- psychiatry consult when extubated and alert. Also may
   consider starting citalopram empirically.
   - Will ask Psych input for starting Ritalin for amotivation and
   depression

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was coiled. She has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was intubated due to persistent hypoxia and respiratory distress, which is likely caused by a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, baseline COPD, and pneumonitis due to barium aspiration. She has severe metabolic alkalosis, which has responded to treatment. She also has a left medullary infarct with left-sided weakness and a right femoral hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require continued ventilatory support. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may recur if not properly managed, which could lead to complications such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Left Medullary Infarct: The patient's left medullary infarct may lead to further neurological deficits or even paralysis.
4. Right Femoral Hematoma: The patient's right femoral hematoma may continue to expand and cause further complications, such as bleeding or compression of surrounding structures.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress and require further antibiotic treatment or even surgical intervention.
6. Atelectasis: The patient's atelectasis may persist and require further treatment, such as bronchoscopy or chest physiotherapy.
7. Pneumonitis: The patient's pneumonitis may worsen and require further treatment, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics.
8. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen during her hospital stay and require further treatment, such as psychotherapy or antidepressant medication.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may worsen during her hospital stay and require further treatment, such as benzodiazepines or relaxation techniques.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal tract may be at risk for complications, such as aspiration or bleeding, due to her recent barium swallow and the presence of a nasogastric tube."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female admitted following PICA embolization and with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure with atelectasis, small effusions and
   aspiratoin of barium leading to acute need for intubation.  She now has
   tolerated extubation with improved lung volumes, improved oxygenation
   and improved atelectasis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair, ambulation today
   -Incentive spirometry
   -Excellent tolerance of wean of O2
   -Complete course of ABX
   -Really will be interventions to maintain airspace patency that will
   drive stability of oxygenation.
   2)S/P PICA Aneurysm-
   -Continue with ASA/Plavix
   3)Nutrition
Will continue to provide TF
s for now, encourage PO with
   swallowing verified as adequate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo female admitted following PICA embolization and with progressive
   hypoxemic respiratory failure with atelectasis, small effusions and
   aspiratoin of barium leading to acute need for intubation.  She now has
   tolerated extubation with improved lung volumes, improved oxygenation
   and improved atelectasis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -OOB to chair, ambulation today
   -Incentive spirometry
   -Excellent tolerance of wean of O2
   -Complete course of ABX
   -Really will be interventions to maintain airspace patency that will
   drive stability of oxygenation.
   2)S/P PICA Aneurysm-
   -Continue with ASA/Plavix
   3)Nutrition
Will continue to provide TF
s for now, encourage PO with
   swallowing verified as adequate.

Summary:

The patient, a 66-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU following PICA embolization and developed progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, atelectasis, small effusions, and aspiration of barium. She was intubated and received antibiotics, steroids, and other medications. The patient has now been extubated and is tolerating oxygen therapy well, with improved lung volumes and oxygenation. She is expected to be discharged to the floor once she is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and she may require continued oxygen therapy and close monitoring to prevent further complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration of barium and small effusions increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Atelectasis: The patient's atelectasis may lead to further respiratory compromise and complications.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to her prolonged bedrest and immobilization.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's aspiration of barium and small effusions may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
6. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression increase the risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and atelectasis may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and atelectasis may lead to neurological complications, such as altered mental status, seizures, and stroke."
