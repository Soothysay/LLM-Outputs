   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - if pressure tolerates, start captopril 6.25 tid this afternoon.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   - discontinue a-line.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed
   -guaiac stools.
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   -continue IV PPi
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the MICU with hypotension and troponin leak, diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She has been receiving IV lasix and heparin to manage her condition. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 87/53 mmHg and heart rate of 77 bpm. She has a mild elevation in her white blood cell count and a slightly decreased hemoglobin level. Her chest pain is controlled with oxycodone and Tylenol, and she is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's hypotension and troponin leak indicate ongoing cardiac compromise. The use of IV lasix and heparin may help to manage this, but the patient's blood pressure and cardiac function should be closely monitored.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly decreased, which may be due to hemodilution or a GI source. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.
3. Chest Pain/Coronaries: The patient's chest pain is likely related to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but the possibility of an acute coronary artery occlusion cannot be ruled out. The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in her chest pain or cardiac function.
4. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has known mitral regurgitation, which may be exacerbated by her current cardiac condition. Further evaluation and management of this condition are needed.
5. Gallbladder Wall Thickening/Concern for Infection: The patient's gallbladder wall thickening on CTA may indicate infection, but her current clinical presentation and laboratory results do not suggest this. The patient should be monitored for any changes in her abdominal pain or temperature.
6. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to her receipt of normal saline for hypotension. This condition is resolving, but the patient should be monitored for any changes in her acid-base status.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is receiving home buproprion and ativan. Her depression should be monitored and managed as part of her overall care plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   The patient
s cardiac cath revealed a lowish cardiac index and apical
   hypo/akinesis concerning for Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy.  She was also
   found to have a possible posterior leaflet flail with moderate to
   severe MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] clinical history is also congruent with Takotsubo
s as
   she experienced her chest pain when in a very stressful situation
   involving her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] presentation is also consistent with
   Takotsubo
s as her troponins were elevated at initial presentation.
   She was weaned off levophed prior to arrival to the CCU.
   -  Will treat her acute systolic heart failure with diuresis.  She
   initially received 40 mg IV lasix on arrival to the CCU.  Her SBPs
   remained stable and she had good urine output to this dose.  Will
   continue to use 40 mg IV lasix prn with a goal negative 1-1.5 L/day.
   -  If she becomes hypotensive, will use milrinone for pressure support
   while diuresing and consider changing the lasix to a lasix drip.
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - Will hold off restarting her home acei given her recent hypotension.
   It can restarted if her pressures remain stable with diuresis.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Acute anemia:  The patient
s Hct on admission was normal at 39,
   however it dropped to 33 the day after admission (however she had
   received many liters of IVF for her hypotension so this could be
   dilutional).  MCV is normal.  She has no clinical evidence of bleeding
   and her Hct remained somewhat stable this morning at 31.3.
   - Continue IV PPI daily.  Can switch to po tomorrow if Hct remains
   stable.
   - Trend Hct.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

She was found to have apical ballooning on echocardiogram and possible posterior leaflet flail with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's cardiac cath revealed a lowish cardiac index and apical hypo/akinesis, and her troponins were elevated at initial presentation.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.2°C, HR 77 bpm, BP 87/53 mmHg, RR 17 breaths/min, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 19 mmHg, total in 7,560 mL, total out 3,315 mL.
* Fluid balance: Balance -207 mL.
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device nasal cannula, SpO2 95%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 18.0, Hct 31.3, Plt 13387, Cr 1.1, TropT 0.42, TCO2 15, Glucose 186.
* Medications: IV lasix 40 mg q4h, oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn, Tylenol prn, ASA 325 mg po daily, simvastatin 40 mg po daily.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 87/53 mmHg, which is low. She may require further treatment to increase her blood pressure.
2. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient's cardiac cath revealed a lowish cardiac index and apical hypo/akinesis, consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She may require further treatment to improve her cardiac function.
3. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has known mitral regurgitation and is followed as an outpatient for this. She may require further treatment to manage her mitral regurgitation.
4. Gallbladder wall thickening/concern for infection: The patient's CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, but she currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile. She may require further monitoring and treatment if her condition worsens.
5. Acute anemia: The patient's Hct dropped from 39 to 31.3, but she has no clinical evidence of bleeding. She may require further treatment to manage her anemia.
6. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient received many liters of normal saline for hypotension, which may have contributed to her metabolic acidosis. She may require further treatment to manage her acidosis.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking home buproprion and ativan prn. She may require further treatment to manage her depression.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she requires further treatment to improve her cardiac function. She also requires further monitoring and treatment for her mitral regurgitation, gallbladder wall thickening/concern for infection, acute anemia, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and depression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - if pressure tolerates, start captopril 6.25 tid this afternoon.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   - discontinue a-line.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed
   -guaiac stools.
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   -continue IV PPi
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Will hold off starting lovenox for now as she has
   had a Hct drop since admission of almost 10.  If her Hct remains
   stable, can consider starting lovenox/Coumadin in a day or two.
   - if pressure tolerates, start captopril 6.25 tid this afternoon.
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an outpatient to reassess her cardiac
   function.
   - discontinue a-line.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed
   -guaiac stools.
   -[**Hospital1 **] hct
   -continue IV PPi
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.  With her TTE
   and cath results, there is another more likely cause for her
   hypotension and she currently has no abdominal pain.
   - Will DC antibiotics and monitor clinically.
   - If she spikes a fever, or becomes clinically unstable, can restart
   them.
   - Trend her WBC (somewhat elevated still)
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the MICU with hypotension and trop leak, diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition has been stable, with some fluctuations in her hemoglobin levels.

The patient's current medications include:

* Lasix IV for diuresis
* Heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of apical ballooning
* Captopril 6.25 tid (pending tolerance)
* Oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn for pain control
* Tylenol prn for pain control
* ASA 325 mg po daily
* Simvastatin 40 mg po daily
* Protonix 40 mg po daily
* Ativan 0.5 mg po prn for anxiety
* Buproprion 100 mg po daily for depression

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 26.5%
* White blood cell count: 18.0
* Platelet count: 39
* Creatinine: 1.1
* Troponin-T: 0.42
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Conjunctiva pale
* JVP unable to be assessed
* Systolic murmur in the precordial area
* Diminished peripheral pulses
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Right lower extremity edema: Trace
* Left lower extremity edema: Trace

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hemorrhage due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulants
* Infection, particularly in the setting of gallbladder wall thickening and elevated white blood cell count
* Acute coronary syndrome, despite the patient's clean coronary arteries on cardiac catheterization
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the use of oxygen therapy
* Renal failure, given the patient's elevated creatinine levels and the use of diuretics
* Neurological complications, given the patient's history of depression and the use of antipsychotic medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing diuretic therapy with Lasix IV
* Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin levels and platelet count
* Continuing anticoagulant therapy with heparin gtt
* Monitoring the patient's white blood cell count and considering restarting antibiotics if the patient develops a fever or becomes clinically unstable
* Continuing pain control with oxycodone and Tylenol
* Continuing treatment for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with captopril and ASA
* Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and considering further interventions as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
 bolus 20mg today.
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Start Coumadin today.
   - captopril 6.25tid
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an prior to discharge to reassess her
   cardiac function.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed.  Stools are guiaic negative, hct stable.
   -daily hct.
   -change ppi to oral omeprazole.
   #Abdominal pain: patient feels bloated, gas pain.  She has not had a
   bowel movement since admission.
   -          continue senna/colace/bisacodyl
   -          simethecone for gas.
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11989**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of hypertension, HL,
   depression, and GERD who was admitted to the MICU on [**1-11**] with
   hypotension and trop leak, found to have apical ballooning on TTE
   suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
   # Hypotension/Acute systolic heart failure/Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy:
   Good response to lasix IV
   - continue to diurese with lasix IV
 bolus 20mg today.
   - Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus in the setting of
   apical ballooning.  Start Coumadin today.
   - captopril 6.25tid
   - She will need a repeat TTE as an prior to discharge to reassess her
   cardiac function.
   #Anemia: may be hemodilutional, but in setting of heparin a GI source
   needs to be considered.  Patient has no lower back pain that would be
   evidence of RP bleed.  Stools are guiaic negative, hct stable.
   -daily hct.
   -change ppi to oral omeprazole.
   #Abdominal pain: patient feels bloated, gas pain.  She has not had a
   bowel movement since admission.
   -          continue senna/colace/bisacodyl
   -          simethecone for gas.
   # Chest pain/coronaries:  Her cardiac cath showed clean coronaries.
   Most likely her chest pain was due to Takotsubo
s cardiomyopathy vs an
   acute coronary artery occlusion which quickly self lysed.  She
   continues to have some chest pain at present.
   - Pain control with oxycodone 5 mg q4h prn and Tylenol prn.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   # Mitral regurgitation:  The patient has known mitral regurgitation and
   is followed as an outpatient for this with yearly echos.  Due to the
   concern for a flail leaflet, CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] was consulted.
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] consult, will f/u recs.
   - Treatment for acute heart failure as above.
   # Rhythm:  She is currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Monitor on tele.
   # Gallbladder wall thickening/Concern for infection:  There was initial
   concern on admission that the patient
s hypotension was related to
   infection, specifically an intraabdominal infection involving the
   gallbladder.  Her CTA revealed gallbladder wall thickening, however she
   currently has no abdominal pain and has been afebrile.
   - F/u BCx.
   # Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  Most likely secondary to the many
   liters of normal saline she received for hypotension.
   - Resolved.
   # Depression:
   - Continue home buproprion and ativan prn.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the MICU with hypotension and troponin leak, diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a range of 112/61-122/76 mmHg. Her heart rate is 77-117 bpm, and her oxygen saturation is 94%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy at 4L/min via nasal cannula.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiac cath revealed clean coronaries, and she is currently in sinus rhythm. However, she has known mitral regurgitation and is being followed as an outpatient.
* Abdominal: The patient is experiencing abdominal discomfort, possibly related to constipation, and has not had a bowel movement since admission.
* Hematology: The patient's hemoglobin is 8.8 g/dL, and her hematocrit is 26.5%. She is receiving blood products, and her platelet count is 39.
* Biochemistry: The patient's troponin-T is 0.42 ng/mL, and her creatine kinase (CK) is 109 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Acute kidney injury due to hypotension and diuretic therapy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to constipation and abdominal discomfort
* Infection, particularly intraabdominal infection, given the gallbladder wall thickening on CTA
* Thromboembolic events, particularly deep vein thrombosis, due to prolonged bed rest and heparin therapy
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
* Depression, given the patient's history of depression and current medication regimen

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue diuretic therapy with lasix IV
* Start Coumadin for prevention of thrombus in the setting of apical ballooning
* Continue heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus
* Repeat TTE prior to discharge to reassess cardiac function
* Continue senna/colace/bisacodyl for constipation
* Continue simethicone for gas
* Continue pain control with oxycodone and Tylenol
* Continue ASA and simvastatin
* Monitor for signs of infection and thromboembolic events
* Continue depression treatment with buproprion and ativan"
