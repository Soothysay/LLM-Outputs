   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), admitted to the ICU with hypertensive emergency. She has been treated with labetalol drip, which has resulted in improved blood pressure control. Her abdominal pain has resolved, and she is currently experiencing intermittent epigastric pain not associated with nausea. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 150-130 systolic. She has a history of pneumonia, chronic renal failure, anemia, and TIA. She is receiving various medications, including antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled, but there is a risk of recurrent hypertensive crisis if the labetalol drip is discontinued too quickly.
2. Constipation: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to constipation, and she is at risk of developing bowel obstruction if not managed properly.
3. Intestinal angina: The patient's abdominal pain may be due to intestinal angina, which can lead to bowel perforation and peritonitis if not managed promptly.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) if not managed properly.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening kidney function if not managed properly.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is a risk of worsening anemia if not managed properly.
7. TIA: The patient has a history of TIA, and there is a risk of recurrent TIA if not managed properly.
8. Medication interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and there is a risk of medication interactions if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medications as needed.
2. Manage the patient's constipation with bowel regimen and guaiac stools.
3. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and adjust medications as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and chest physical therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust medications as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust medications as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's TIA risk and adjust medications as needed.
8. Monitor the patient for medication interactions and adjust medications as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia, TIA, and abdominal pain. She was transferred to the MICU due to a hypertensive emergency, which has now been resolved. The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 150/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Hypertensive urgency/emergency: The patient's blood pressure was initially elevated, but has been controlled with IV labetalol. She may have been hypertensive due to constipation and abdominal pain, which has improved.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has increasing pulmonary edema, but her oxygen requirement has improved.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a productive cough, infiltrate on CXR, and Moraxella in sputum cx. She is currently receiving empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
4. Abdominal pain, nausea: The patient's abdominal pain is stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and normal lactate. She may have intestinal angina or dyspepsia.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable, and she is being renally dosed with medications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but has increased from yesterday.
7. FEN: The patient is receiving IVFs and replete lytes prn, and is on a regular diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure may become elevated again, requiring further treatment.
2. Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, requiring further treatment.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, requiring further treatment.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen, requiring further evaluation and treatment.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may worsen, requiring further treatment.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring further treatment.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her underlying medical conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Discontinuing labetalol drip and restarting oral regimen of Valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and amlodipine.
2. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting treatment as necessary.
3. Continuing empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
4. Monitoring the patient's abdominal pain and adjusting treatment as necessary.
5. Continuing to monitor the patient's renal function and adjusting treatment as necessary.
6. Continuing to monitor the patient's anemia and adjusting treatment as necessary.
7. Continuing to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjusting treatment as necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk of developing complications due to her underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, bacterial, and abdominal pain with malignant hypertension. The patient is receiving IV medications, including labetalol for hypertension and heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 165/41 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and face tent, with an SpO2 of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 376 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacterial pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's malignant hypertension may lead to hypertensive crisis, which can cause cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal pain and hypertension may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
5. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and hypertension may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of stress ulcer, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure and sepsis.
8. Renal failure: The patient's hypertension and sepsis may lead to renal failure, which can require dialysis.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved. Had HA and SBP>200 but these now
   resolved. Floor team having difficulty achieving control (systolic >
   210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg daily, and amlodipine
   10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO q6H with PRN 10mg IV.
   They have also tried enalaprilat with no effect. However, upon
   transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further expansion of
   antihypertensive regimen. Unclear when BP improved but has not required
   labetalol drip. Possibly was hypertensive from constipation and
   abdominal pain which is now improved. Stroke was also concern but would
   not expect spontaneous improvement
   - Furosemide 40mg IV and hydral IV prn
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine
   - PRN hydralazine and will start labetalol drip if neccessary to
   maintain SBP<180
   - F/U read MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently. Increased from yesterday.
   - trend
   - guaiac stools
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: DNR/DNI - on previous admissions, confirmed w/ Daughter [**Name (NI) 7200**]
   and grandchildren
   # CONTACT: Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] [**0-0-**]
   # DISPO: ICU for now, floor if BP remains stable

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved. Had HA and SBP>200 but these now
   resolved. Floor team having difficulty achieving control (systolic >
   210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg daily, and amlodipine
   10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO q6H with PRN 10mg IV.
   They have also tried enalaprilat with no effect. However, upon
   transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further expansion of
   antihypertensive regimen. Unclear when BP improved but has not required
   labetalol drip. Possibly was hypertensive from constipation and
   abdominal pain which is now improved. Stroke was also concern but would
   not expect spontaneous improvement
   - Furosemide 40mg IV and hydral IV prn
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine
   - PRN hydralazine and will start labetalol drip if neccessary to
   maintain SBP<180
   - F/U read MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently. Increased from yesterday.
   - trend
   - guaiac stools
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and abdominal pain with abdominal tenderness. They have a history of hypertension, including a hypertensive crisis and emergency. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 202/52 mmHg. They are receiving antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone and are being closely monitored for fluid balance, hemodynamics, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or death.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be a sign of a more severe underlying condition, such as perforation or necrosis, which could lead to sepsis, abscess formation, or death.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebral edema, or cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and excessive fluid administration may lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, or cardiac failure.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support is critical, and failure to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation may lead to respiratory failure, hypoxia, or death.
6. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and abdominal pain may lead to sepsis, which could worsen their condition and increase the risk of mortality.
7. Vascular Complications: The patient's peripheral vascular assessment was not performed, which may indicate a potential risk of vascular complications, such as thrombosis or embolism.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as the need for further evaluation and treatment to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), and abdominal pain with abdominal tenderness. They have a history of hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.7°C, Tcurrent of 36.7°C, HR of 87 bpm, BP of 202/52 mmHg, RR of 15 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. They have a sinus rhythm and are receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, no anxiety, and no diaphoresis. They have crackles in the bilateral lungs, and their abdominal examination is soft with minimal tenderness in the epigastric region.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 376 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, and glucose of 132 mg/dL. The patient is receiving antibiotics and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP). They are also receiving treatment for hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and bilateral crackles in the lungs increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacterial pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal tenderness and distension increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency) increases the risk of hypertensive crisis.
5. Bloodstream infection: The patient's central line and antibiotics increase the risk of bloodstream infection.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support and prolonged intubation increase the risk of VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central line increase the risk of DVT.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation
   - continue to trend
   - guaiac stools
   # TIA history:  No mental status changes.  CT negative for acute
   process.  Continue aggrenox and simvastatin
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: DNR/DNI - on previous admissions, confirmed w/ Daughter [**Name (NI) 7200**]
   and grandchildren
   # CONTACT: Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] [**0-0-**]
   # DISPO: ICU for now, floor if BP remains stable after discontinuing
   labetalol drip

   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is admitted to the MICU with a history of mesenteric ischemia, TIA, and abdominal pain. She was transferred from the floor with a hypertensive emergency, which has since been resolved. Her current vital signs are: T: 36.7°C, HR: 87 bpm, BP: 202/52 mmHg, RR: 15 inspirations per minute, and SpO2: 98%. She is receiving IV fluids and medications for hypertension, heart failure, and pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she is at risk of developing hypertension-related complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal damage, and cerebral hemorrhage.
2. Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema has improved, but she is still at risk of developing heart failure complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is improving, but she is at risk of developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is stable, but she is at risk of developing complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable, but she is at risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but she is at risk of developing iron deficiency or worsening of anemia.
7. TIA history: The patient's TIA history is a concern, and she is at risk of developing another TIA or stroke.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's current medications include IV labetalol, furosemide, and ceftriaxone, as well as oral medications such as valsartan, metoprolol, and amlodipine. She is also receiving IV fluids and bowel regimen for abdominal pain and constipation. The plan is to discontinue labetalol drip and restart oral regimen of Valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and amlodipine. The patient will also receive daily doses of furosemide and continue to receive IV fluids and bowel regimen.

Further monitoring and management are needed to address the patient's potential medical complications and to ensure her overall health and well-being."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the MICU with a history of mesenteric ischemia and TIA, presenting with abdominal pain, hyponatremia, and hypertensive urgency. She has been treated with labetalol and hydralazine, and her blood pressure has improved. She has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 202/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination is notable for bibasilar crackles, minimal tenderness in the epigastrum, and absent pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are stable, with a slight decrease in potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's medications include Valsartan, hydralazine, metoprolol, amlodipine, and albuterol and ipratropium nebs. She has also received furosemide, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to the use of nephrotoxic medications such as furosemide and the potential for dehydration.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Abdominal pain worsening: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen, leading to potential complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure may increase again, leading to a hypertensive crisis, which could have life-threatening consequences.
5. Heart failure progression: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure may worsen, leading to potential complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.
6. Anemia worsening: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to potential complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased exercise tolerance.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, particularly pneumonia, given her compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or address these potential complications and optimize her care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for management of hypertensive urgency. She has a history of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), and abdominal pain, including abdominal tenderness. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 156/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen, warm skin with trace pre-tibial edema, and normal neurological examination.

The patient is receiving medications for hypertension, including Valsartan, Metoprolol, HCTZ, and Amlodipine, as well as antibiotics for pneumonia. She is also receiving hydration and oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, and there is a risk of developing a hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or empyema.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may persist or worsen, potentially leading to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or necrosis.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
5. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperature and white blood cell count may indicate a developing infection, which can lead to sepsis or organ failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease increases her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or heart failure.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate renal insufficiency, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor oral intake and potential for malnutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as protein, calories, or vitamins.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her hypertension, pneumonia, and abdominal pain. She should also receive antibiotics for pneumonia and hydration therapy to manage her electrolyte imbalance. The patient's family should be educated on her condition and treatment plan, and a plan for transfer to a floor bed should be implemented."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the MICU for management of hypertensive urgency. She has a history of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired, and abdominal pain. She is currently being treated with Ceftriaxone for pneumonia and is off labetalol drip. Her blood pressure is still labile, and she is experiencing hypertension. She is also experiencing low-grade temperatures and abdominal pain, which is initially concerning for mesenteric ischemia but has been ruled out with normal CT results and normal lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, and she is at risk of developing a hypertensive crisis, which can lead to severe complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and renal failure.
2. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia can progress to more severe complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may indicate a more severe underlying condition such as necrotizing pancreatitis or bowel perforation, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Infection: The patient's low-grade temperatures and abnormal lab results may indicate an underlying infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and cardiac history put her at risk for cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's hypertension and decreased renal function put her at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
