   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also
   includes post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in
   correct time frame per Heme-Onc; received
   1. Altered Mental Status
   Etiology of his altered mental status is likely multifactorial related
   to his gram negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to
   parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or
   meningitis are also possible. Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]
   and had only 1 WBCs, although this is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of neutropenia. His glucose and total protein were normal,
   which is somewhat reassuring. Additional infection is also possible,
   although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia
   has been relatively chronic during this admission and is likely not a
   large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - will start treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   desensitization protocol (see below)
   - will start noninvasive ventilation for increased ventilation to
   improve his hypercarbia with intubation as needed
   - follow-up CSF Cultures
   - follow-up CSF studies - Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and
   Coccidiodes
   - avoid further psychotropic medications
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI
   Patient had ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**], although subsequent urine
   cultures were negative after treatment with aztreonam. Surprisingly
   then his blood cultures returned with ESBL bacteremia on [**2165-3-15**],
   despite clearing of his urinary tract infection. He has been on
   aztreonam and gentamicin for treatment of this, although meropenem
   would be preferred in this patient due to inferiority of gentamicin in
   neutropenic patients. Patient unfortunately has anaphylaxis reaction to
   penicillins in the past and will need meropenem desensitiziation
   protocol for this.
   - discontinue gentamicin
   - continue vancomycin for broad gram positive coverage in this patient
   with febrile neutropenia, will follow-up with BMT regarding peeling
   this back given no gram positive infection to date and cultures NGTD
   - will follow-up with BMT team regarding need for micafungin
   - allergy consultation
   - start meropenem desensitization protocol once respiratory status is
   improved
   - will need tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology once
   patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint and has received first
   dose of meropenem
   - daily blood cultures
   - appreciate ID input
   3. Hypoxia and Hypercarbia
   Patient is both hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to parainfluenza
   infection and obstructive sleep apnea.
   - will try noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and
   ventilation; if no improvement will need to intubate
   4. Myeloma
   Patient is now day + 9 for SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate
   mofetil
   5. Hyponatremia
   Etiology is most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - continue to monitor daily sodium
   - continue free water restriction
   - continue salt tabs
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient with difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of
   infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.
   - appreciate psychiatry input
   - continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol eye drops
   10. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - hold atorvastatin in the acute setting
   11. Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   Stable
   - continue gapabentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone prn
   12. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also
   includes post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in
   correct time frame per Heme-Onc; received
   1. Altered Mental Status
   Etiology of his altered mental status is likely multifactorial related
   to his gram negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to
   parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or
   meningitis are also possible. Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]
   and had only 1 WBCs, although this is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of neutropenia. His glucose and total protein were normal,
   which is somewhat reassuring. Additional infection is also possible,
   although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia
   has been relatively chronic during this admission and is likely not a
   large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - will start treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   desensitization protocol (see below)
   - will start noninvasive ventilation for increased ventilation to
   improve his hypercarbia with intubation as needed
   - follow-up CSF Cultures
   - follow-up CSF studies - Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and
   Coccidiodes
   - avoid further psychotropic medications
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI
   Patient had ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**], although subsequent urine
   cultures were negative after treatment with aztreonam. Surprisingly
   then his blood cultures returned with ESBL bacteremia on [**2165-3-15**],
   despite clearing of his urinary tract infection. He has been on
   aztreonam and gentamicin for treatment of this, although meropenem
   would be preferred in this patient due to inferiority of gentamicin in
   neutropenic patients. Patient unfortunately has anaphylaxis reaction to
   penicillins in the past and will need meropenem desensitiziation
   protocol for this.
   - discontinue gentamicin
   - continue vancomycin for broad gram positive coverage in this patient
   with febrile neutropenia, will follow-up with BMT regarding peeling
   this back given no gram positive infection to date and cultures NGTD
   - will follow-up with BMT team regarding need for micafungin
   - allergy consultation
   - start meropenem desensitization protocol once respiratory status is
   improved
   - will need tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology once
   patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint and has received first
   dose of meropenem
   - daily blood cultures
   - appreciate ID input
   3. Hypoxia and Hypercarbia
   Patient is both hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to parainfluenza
   infection and obstructive sleep apnea.
   - will try noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and
   ventilation; if no improvement will need to intubate
   4. Myeloma
   Patient is now day + 9 for SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate
   mofetil
   5. Hyponatremia
   Etiology is most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - continue to monitor daily sodium
   - continue free water restriction
   - continue salt tabs
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient with difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of
   infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.
   - appreciate psychiatry input
   - continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol eye drops
   10. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - hold atorvastatin in the acute setting
   11. Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   Stable
   - continue gapabentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone prn
   12. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   1. Altered Mental Status
   Etiology of his altered mental status is likely multifactorial related
   to his gram negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to
   parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia. Encephalitis or
   meningitis are also possible. Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]
   and had only 1 WBCs, although this is difficult to interpret in the
   setting of neutropenia. His glucose and total protein were normal,
   which is somewhat reassuring. Additional infection is also possible,
   although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia
   has been relatively chronic during this admission and is likely not a
   large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - will start treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   desensitization protocol (see below)
   - will start noninvasive ventilation for increased ventilation to
   improve his hypercarbia with intubation as needed
   - follow-up CSF Cultures
   - follow-up CSF studies - Toxoplasma gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and
   Coccidiodes
   - avoid further psychotropic medications
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   2. E. coli Bacteremia and UTI
   Patient had ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**], although subsequent urine
   cultures were negative after treatment with aztreonam. Surprisingly
   then his blood cultures returned with ESBL bacteremia on [**2165-3-15**],
   despite clearing of his urinary tract infection. He has been on
   aztreonam and gentamicin for treatment of this, although meropenem
   would be preferred in this patient due to inferiority of gentamicin in
   neutropenic patients. Patient unfortunately has anaphylaxis reaction to
   penicillins in the past and will need meropenem desensitiziation
   protocol for this.
   - discontinue gentamicin
   - continue vancomycin for broad gram positive coverage in this patient
   with febrile neutropenia, will follow-up with BMT regarding peeling
   this back given no gram positive infection to date and cultures NGTD
   - will follow-up with BMT team regarding need for micafungin
   - allergy consultation
   - start meropenem desensitization protocol once respiratory status is
   improved
   - will need tunneled catheter removed by interventional radiology once
   patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint and has received first
   dose of meropenem
   - daily blood cultures
   - appreciate ID input
   3. Hypoxia and Hypercarbia
   Patient is both hypoxic and hypercarbic, likely due to parainfluenza
   infection and obstructive sleep apnea.
   - will try noninvasive ventilation to improve oxygenation and
   ventilation; if no improvement will need to intubate
   4. Myeloma
   Patient is now day + 9 for SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - appreciate BMT recs
   - continue acyclovir, clotrimazole, and bactrim prophylaxis
   - continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   - continue immunosuppression with cyclosporine and mycophenolate
   mofetil
   5. Hyponatremia
   Etiology is most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia.
   - continue to monitor daily sodium
   - continue free water restriction
   - continue salt tabs
   6. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
   Patient with difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of
   infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   - appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   - continue insulin sliding scale with lantus
   7. Hypertension
   Patient has a history of hypertension in the past requiring Metoprolol
   Succinate 50mg PO bid and amlodipine 2.5mg PO daily. Currently
   normotensive
   - hold Toprol XL and amlodipine in the setting of gram negative rod
   bacteremia and will restart if BP increases
   8. Depression
   Patient has a history of major depression with significant medication
   requirements.
   - appreciate psychiatry input
   - continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   9. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue timolol eye drops
   10. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable
   - hold atorvastatin in the acute setting
   11. Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   Stable
   - continue gapabentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone prn
   12. GERD
   Stable
   - continue PPI

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma 9 days ago. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical history, including multiple allergies, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: likely multifactorial, related to gram-negative rod bacteremia, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia
* Hypoxia: likely due to parainfluenza infection and obstructive sleep apnea
* Hypercarbia: likely due to parainfluenza infection and obstructive sleep apnea
* E. coli bacteremia: treated with aztreonam and gentamicin, but patient has anaphylaxis reaction to penicillins and will require meropenem desensitization

   - F/u pending cultures
   - Received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to his gram
   negative rod bacteremia and hypercarbia related to parainfluenza,
   further worsened by hyponatremia. Lumbar puncture was performed on
   [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret in the setting of neutropenia but
   nl glucose and total protein reassuring. Additional infection is also
   possible, although cultures remain NGTD for additional infection.
   Hyponatremia has been relatively chronic during this admission and is
   likely not a large contributor to his altered mental status.
   - Continue treatmement for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. Lastly, could represent
   DAH; less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day +9. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including gram-negative rod bacteremia, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and GERD.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.1
* Hct: 25.7
* Plt: 19
* Cr: 0.8
* TCO2: 33
* Glucose: 127
* ALT/AST: 17/53
* Alk Phos/T Bili: 63/0.8
* Differential-Neuts: 68.0%
* Band: 6.0%
* Lymph: 10.0%
* Mono: 14.0%
* Eos: 0.0%
* Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's ARDS is worsening, and he requires mechanical ventilation.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including gram-negative rod bacteremia, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia.
3. E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli UTI and bacteremia, which requires continued treatment with meropenem.
4. ARF: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which may be multifactorial and requires further evaluation and treatment.
5. Myeloma: The patient is at risk for complications related to his multiple myeloma, including engraftment syndrome and infections.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely related to SIADH, and he requires continued monitoring and treatment.
7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are difficult to control, and he requires continued insulin sliding scale and lantus therapy.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently normal.
9. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and he requires continued treatment with duloxetine and lorazepam.
10. Glaucoma: The patient has stable glaucoma, and he requires continued timolol eye drops.
11. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has stable hyperlipidemia, and he requires continued atorvastatin therapy.
12. Peripheral neuropathy and pain: The patient has stable peripheral neuropathy and pain, and he requires continued gabapentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone therapy.
13. GERD: The patient has stable GERD, and he requires continued PPI therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment with meropenem for E. coli bacteremia and UTI.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue treatment for ARF, including fluid boluses and renal consult.
4. Continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine, and adjust as indicated.
5. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Continue treatment for hyponatremia, including free water restriction and salt tabs.
8. Continue insulin sliding scale and lantus therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
9. Continue duloxetine and lorazepam therapy for depression.
10. Continue timolol eye drops for glaucoma.
11. Continue atorvastatin therapy for hyperlipidemia.
12. Continue gabapentin, oxycontin, and oxycodone therapy for peripheral neuropathy and pain.
13. Continue PPI therapy for GERD.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is NPO for now, pending improvement in respiratory status, and will start on tube feeds.
2. Glycemic control: The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale.
3. Lines: The patient has a tunneled Hickman line, 20-gauge line, and arterial line.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is on boots for DVT, and stress ulcer and VAP prophylaxis.
5. Communication: A family meeting has been held, and the patient's code status is full code.
6. Disposition: The patient is currently in the ICU and will be discharged when his condition improves."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with MM and now with ATG given and found to have UTI-_Rx
   with ABX with stem cell infusion given [**3-8**].  He then evolved fever and
   altered mental status and with need for ongoing Rx for GNR bacteremia
   with E. Coli having been seen in Urine pre-transplant.  He does have
   history of anaphylactic reaction to PCN in past and with need for
   Meropenem Rx patient transfer to ICU with increased somnolence and need
   for desensitization.  Across the past 24 hours patient has had
   progressive respiratory failure with persistent and worsening hypoxemia
   despite BIPAP suppor non-invasively.  This is all concering for
   evolution of significant sepsis in the setting of incompletely
   controlled GNR bacteremia with antibiotic choice limited by significant
   anaphylactic response to PCN seen in the past.  He now has progressed
   to hypoxemic respiratory failure consistent with ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure
This does appear to be acute onset of bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates, P/F ratio <200 and not clearly attributable to
   left heart failure.  Additionally he has suggestion of possible
   engraftment syndrome as timing is reasonable.  The notion that this is
   secondary to Meropenem is significantly less likely as BP stable and no
   evidence of prominent wheezing.  Viral pneumonia has to be considered
   but patient has been in hospital
   -Will ventilate with low tidal volume ventilation
   -FIO2 weaned to 0.5
   -PEEP quite adequate and will utilize balloon monitoring if FIO2 unable
   to be weaned
   -Check sputum for vial and bacterial pathogens
BAL for DAH and possible
   pathogens would be reasonable for alveolar sample and quantitative
   specimen and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 7300**].
   -Continue with broad spectum ABX
   -Will advance ETT by 2 cm
   2)Sepsis-This is clear evidence of significant bacteremia and sepsis
   with ARDS seen at this time.  Patient has had signfiicant bacteremia
   with indwelling catheters in place needed for access.  The issue is
   patient has had recurrence and significant decline in the setting of
   the antibiotic choices have been limited by allergic reaction in the
   past.  Encouragingly patient has had tolerance of desensitization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple myeloma (MM) who developed respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute renal failure while undergoing stem cell infusion. He has a history of anaphylactic reaction to penicillin and requires desensitization to meropenem. He was intubated for hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). He has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and his partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio is less than 200, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has a positive blood culture for E. coli and a urine culture for E. coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to the progression of ARDS and the need for continued mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen due to the presence of indwelling catheters and the limited antibiotic options. There is a risk of multi-organ failure and death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen due to the presence of sepsis and the need for continued fluid resuscitation. There is a risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection, due to the presence of indwelling catheters and the need for continued antibiotic therapy.
5. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the need for continued anticoagulation therapy and the presence of indwelling catheters.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to the need for continued antibiotics and the presence of indwelling catheters.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure, due to the need for continued fluid resuscitation and the presence of indwelling catheters.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke, due to the need for continued anticoagulation therapy and the presence of indwelling catheters."

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome, keeping in mind
   that steroids may impair immune response to possible viral pneumonia.
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -re-address with BMT and ID whether to remove lines
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 21.1 today (has been this low before although
   usually in mid 20s).
   -recheck hct in PM
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +11 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probably acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable (128-131-129).
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   -f/u with psychiatry re: stopping duloxetine versus starting another
   SSRI in its place
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   -continue oxycodone prn
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day 0. He was admitted to the ICU on day 9 due to altered mental status, hypoxia, and suspected ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. He also has a history of parainfluenza pneumonia and is at risk for post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Respiratory distress with ARDS
* Altered mental status likely due to infection and hypercarbia
* ESBL E. coli bacteremia with UTI
* Oliguric renal failure likely due to multifactorial causes, including hypotension, volume depletion, supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, and acyclovir
* Anemia with hematocrit 21.1
* Myeloma with ongoing immunosuppression
* Hyponatremia likely due to SIADH
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus with difficulty controlling blood glucose
* Hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and ARDS may progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potential extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury, requiring dialysis and potential renal replacement therapy.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and ongoing immunosuppression may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, including fungal, viral, and bacterial infections.
5. Engraftment syndrome: The patient's ongoing immunosuppression and history of parainfluenza pneumonia may increase the risk of engraftment syndrome, which can cause fever, rash, and other systemic symptoms.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GERD and ongoing immunosuppression may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus and difficulty controlling blood glucose may increase the risk of hyperglycemia, which can cause complications such as ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
8. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and ongoing immunosuppression may increase the risk of hypertension, which can cause cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
9. Depression: The patient's history of depression and ongoing immunosuppression may increase the risk of depression, which can affect the patient's quality of life and increase the risk of suicidal behavior.
10. Glaucoma: The patient's history of glaucoma and ongoing immunosuppression may increase the risk of glaucoma, which can cause vision loss and blindness.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI with meropenem.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosages as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosages as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation medications as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust antacid medications as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's immunosuppression and adjust medications as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glaucoma and adjust treatment as needed.
10. Consider consulting with a psychiatrist to assess the patient's depression and develop a treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, will f/u with Heme re: inclination
   to continue treating possible engraftment syndrome
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -re-address with BMT and ID whether to remove lines
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +11 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probably acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -clotrimazole and bactrim prophylaxis per protocol
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable (128-131-129).
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -continue duloxetine and lorazepam PO/IV prn
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, GNR bacteremia, and other complications.

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS, and a PaO2:FiO2 ratio <200. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator.

The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, likely multifactorial in nature, and is being treated for possible engraftment syndrome.

The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and is currently being treated with meropenem. The patient's renal function is compromised, with oliguric renal failure, and the differential diagnosis includes acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and GERD, and is being managed accordingly.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient is not weaned off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of GNR bacteremia and UTI, and there is a risk of sepsis if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of acute kidney injury if the patient is not adequately hydrated and if the underlying cause of the kidney injury is not addressed.
4. Engraftment syndrome: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and there is a risk of engraftment syndrome if the patient's immune system is not adequately suppressed.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and there is a risk of hyperglycemia if the patient's blood glucose levels are not adequately controlled.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and there is a risk of hypertension if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of GNR bacteremia and UTI, and there is a risk of infection if the patient is not adequately treated.
8. Nephrotoxicity: The patient is at risk of nephrotoxicity if the patient is not adequately hydrated and if the underlying cause of the kidney injury is not addressed.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the goal is to wean the patient off the ventilator.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is being treated with meropenem for GNR bacteremia and UTI.
3. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require renal replacement therapy if the patient's renal function does not improve.
4. Fluid management: The patient's fluid management is critical, and the patient must be adequately hydrated to prevent kidney injury.
5. Blood glucose management: The patient's blood glucose levels must be adequately controlled to prevent hyperglycemia.
6. Blood pressure management: The patient's blood pressure must be adequately controlled to prevent hypertension.
7. Infection control: The patient must be adequately treated for GNR bacteremia and UTI to prevent infection.
8. Nephrotoxicity prevention: The patient must be adequately hydrated and the underlying cause of the kidney injury must be addressed to prevent nephrotoxicity."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male admit with sepsis and respiratory failure with ARDS and
   found to have Para-influenza 3 seen on BAL specimen.  He has blood
   alveolar secretions but without progressively bloody return which
   argues against ongoing active pulmonary capillaritis.  This may more
   likely represent a pattern of diffuse alveolar damage and leak of RBC's
   into alveolar space.
   1)ARDS/Respiratory Failure
he has had reasonable optimization of PEEP
   and ventilatory support with lung protective strategies.  We have CXR
   with minimal change day to day.  Peak inspiratory pressures in the
   range of 24 are quite reasonable and should be well tolerated.
   -PEEP up-titration to 12 as this was trialed with minimal change and he
   may well be just below lower inflection point of compliance curve.
   -Continuew tih Low Vt strategy and permissive hypercapnia
   -PEEP 12 today
   -Trail FIO2 wean to 0.4
   2) RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)--Hypotension, med
   effects, contrast effects and sepsis all playing a role and
   unfortunately at this time he is anuric and has continued profound
   impairment in renal function.
   -Will need CVVH for volume removal if oxygenation difficult but at this
   time would continue to renal dose meds and provide support as above and
   renal dose meds
   Neurontin to be held
   3)Sepsis-_GNR bacteremia convincingly dominant insult and will continue
   with
   -Meropenem
   -IVF as needed
   -Extensive discussions in regards to catheters
would favor continued

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure with ARDS. The patient has been diagnosed with Para-influenza 3 on BAL specimen and has blood alveolar secretions without progressive bleeding, suggesting diffuse alveolar damage and RBC leakage into the alveolar space.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. ARDS/Respiratory Failure: The patient has had reasonable optimization of PEEP and ventilatory support with lung-protective strategies. However, the patient may still be below the lower inflection point of the compliance curve, and PEEP up-titration to 12 may be necessary.
2. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has profound impairment in renal function, is anuric, and has been experiencing hypotension, medication effects, contrast effects, and sepsis. CVVH may be necessary for volume removal if oxygenation becomes difficult.
3. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is convincingly the dominant insult. Meropenem will be continued, and IVF as needed will be provided. Blood cultures will be repeated today to ensure infection control.
4. Multiple Myeloma (Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has undergone bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is receiving ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory failure, leading to further compromise of lung function and potentially life-threatening hypoxia.
2. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and profound impairment in renal function may lead to further deterioration in renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia may lead to further sepsis, potentially causing organ failure and death.
4. ARDS: The patient's diffuse alveolar damage and RBC leakage into the alveolar space may lead to further worsening of ARDS, potentially causing life-threatening hypoxia.
5. Infection control: The patient's GNR bacteremia may lead to further infection, potentially causing sepsis and organ failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.1
* Hct: 25.7
* Plt: 19
* Cr: 1.4
* TCO2: 33
* Glucose: 35
* Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.2 mg/dL
* ALT/AST: 11-1
* Alk Phos/T Bili: 62/0.5
* Differential-Neuts: 85.0%
* Band: 1.0%
* Lymph: 2.0%
* Mono: 6.0%
* Eos: 0.0%
* Imaging: CXR shows minimal change day to day, with diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates.

The patient's imaging results show:

* CXR: Minimal change day to day, with diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Midazolam (Versed) - 4 mg/hour
* Fentanyl - 75 mcg/hour
* Gentamicin
* Vancomycin
* Acyclovir
* Meropenem
* Micafungin
* Lansoprazole
* Neurontin (held)

The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies indicate that the patient is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, and ARDS. The patient's medication list includes several antibiotics and other medications that may be contributing to the patient's condition. Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +9 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred
   to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and
   meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   yesterday highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen. Lastly, could represent DAH;
   less likely as sputum s/p intubation initially pink but cleared
   although certainly concern given thrombocytopenia.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -cont micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, trying to avoid steroids in setting
   of possible viral pneumonia
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 25, up from 20 after 1U PRBCs- appropriate bump
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +12 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; f/u
   cyclosporine level and adjust as indicated
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Currently
   normotensive.
   -holding antihypertensives in setting of gram negative rod bacteremia
   and will restart when clinically improved
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has developed respiratory distress, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS, and is requiring mechanical ventilation. He also has altered mental status, likely multifactorial, and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteremia and is at risk for further septic episodes.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, and his creatinine levels are increasing. He is at risk for further ARF, particularly if his underlying conditions, such as hypotension and volume depletion, are not addressed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is at risk for hyperglycemia, particularly in the setting of infection and steroid use.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for further hypertension, particularly in the setting of infection and medication use.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely related to SIADH, and is at risk for further complications, including seizures and coma.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of infections, including ESBL E. coli bacteremia, and is at risk for further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, particularly in the setting of infection and medication use.

Recommendations:

1. Continue meropenem and vancomycin for treatment of ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting his ventilator settings as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if his creatinine levels continue to increase.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and consider restarting antihypertensives when clinically improved.
6. Monitor the patient's sodium levels closely and consider adjusting his fluid management plan as needed.
7. Consider starting TPN as the patient is not tolerating tube feeds.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider adjusting his medication regimen as needed.

These recommendations are based on the patient's medical history, laboratory results, and current clinical status. Further evaluation and management will depend on the patient's response to treatment and the development of any new complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +12 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc. [**Month (only) 51**] also have infectious
   process, including atypical, viral, PCP or even rapidly evolving
   bacterial pneumonia in immunosuppresed host. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -wean PEEP as tolerated with goal PEEP of 8; then may try pressure
   support trial if oxygenating well (after weaning sedation)
   -continue vanco and meropenem, check vancomycin level today
   -continue micafungin
   -received high-dose solumedrol x 1, trying to avoid steroids in setting
   of possible viral pneumonia
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   -consider repeat CXR this afternoon
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -follow-up blood and urine cultures, CSF cx and studies (Toxoplasma
   gondii, EBV PCR, HHV 6, HSV, and Coccidiodes)
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 25, up from 20 after 1U PRBCs- appropriate bump

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He is a day +12 post-allogeneic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. The patient's respiratory status has rapidly deteriorated, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a goal Vt of 4 mL/kg IBW per ARDS protocol. The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to infection, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia. He has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and is being treated with meropenem for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is rapidly deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a severe infection with ESBL E. coli bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which may be related to multiple factors, including hypotension, volume depletion, and supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which may be related to SIADH, and is at risk of developing seizures or other complications.
5. Infection-related complications: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and is being treated with meropenem, which may lead to allergic reactions or other complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding, and his platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is at risk of developing hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his mechanical ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem and monitor his response to treatment.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medication dosing accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid management and medication dosing accordingly.
5. Consider repeating the patient's CXR to evaluate for any changes in his lung infiltrates.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedation and pain management accordingly.
7. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to evaluate for any signs of meningitis or other central nervous system complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin dosing accordingly.
9. Consider starting the patient on TPN if he continues to have high residuals with tube feeds.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust his platelet transfusions accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, ARDS, and acute renal failure. He has a history of multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/70 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on 45% FiO2. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2 and a systemic vascular resistance of 1,200 dyne/s/cm5.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 51 mg/dL. His liver function tests are normal, but his alkaline phosphatase level is elevated.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a compliance of 47.8 cmH2O/mL and a plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen of 90 mmHg.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and Dilaudid-Hp. He is currently receiving antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals for his sepsis and ARDS.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation with a target PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 45%. He will be weaned off sedation and will be evaluated for extubation. His sepsis will be managed with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, and his renal failure will be managed with hemodialysis and medication adjustments.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase his risk of infection, particularly with fungal or viral pathogens.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac index is low, which may increase his risk of cardiovascular instability and the need for cardiac support.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61yo male now Day +13 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -Continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials.
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other Cx data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].  Will give 1 Unit
   of PRBC.
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +12 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Became
   hypertensive yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to decreasing sedation and
   agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in pain.
   -Started on lopressor and nitro gtt.  Will wean gtt as tolerated.
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes
   post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome as in correct time
   frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.. BAL viral screen positive
   for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
   -mechanical vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -Continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials.
   -continue vanco and meropenem
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other Cx data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oligric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -follow-up renal recs
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].  Will give 1 Unit
   of PRBC.
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +12 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -f/u with renal re: correction of hyponatremia as patient is currently
   anuric
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Became
   hypertensive yesterday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to decreasing sedation and
   agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in pain.
   -Started on lopressor and nitro gtt.  Will wean gtt as tolerated.
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma 13 days ago. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has developed respiratory distress, likely due to ARDS, and is being mechanically ventilated. He also has altered mental status, likely multifactorial, and is being treated for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has oliguric renal failure, which is likely multifactorial, and is being treated with meropenem and micafungin. He has anemia and is being transfused with PRBCs. He has a history of multiple myeloma and is being treated with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteremia and is at risk of developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is likely multifactorial, and is at risk of developing AKI.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to SIADH or underlying kidney disease.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to underlying kidney disease or bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections, including ESBL E. coli bacteremia and parainfluenza pneumonia, and is at risk of developing additional infections.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is at risk of developing hyperglycemia.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk of developing hypertension due to decreased sedation and agitation.
9. Depression: The patient has a history of major depression and is at risk of developing depression.
10. Glaucoma: The patient has a history of glaucoma and is at risk of developing glaucoma due to decreased visual acuity.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem and micafungin.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosing as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust fluid management as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosing as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with admission with ARDS and now with significant
   improvememt in respiratory failure and able to tolerate wean of PEEP
   and move to PSV.  He retains severe oliguria and worsening renal
   failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-he is now limited by signifiant volume overload
   despite what appears to be improvement in oxygenation as ARDS has
   likely improved
however, volume overload is now primary barrier to
   extubation.
   -Wean sedation
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -Will need to move to CVVH today given need for volume removal in
   absence of capacity to adequately diurese with Lasix
   -Continue PSV
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Meropenem to continue
   3)BMT--For Multiple Myeloma-
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Continued worsening of creatinine and near
   anuria.
   -Will move to catheter placement today if no brisk response seen for
   diuretics
   -Lytes/Acid-Base status appears reasonable.
   4)Hypertension-
   -Atenolol to continue
   -TNG weaned to off

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo male with admission with ARDS and now with significant
   improvememt in respiratory failure and able to tolerate wean of PEEP
   and move to PSV.  He retains severe oliguria and worsening renal
   failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure-he is now limited by signifiant volume overload
   despite what appears to be improvement in oxygenation as ARDS has
   likely improved
however, volume overload is now primary barrier to
   extubation.
   -Wean sedation
   -Continue with antibiotics
   -Will need to move to CVVH today given need for volume removal in
   absence of capacity to adequately diurese with Lasix
   -Continue PSV
   2)Pneumonia-
   -Meropenem to continue
   3)BMT--For Multiple Myeloma-
   4)Acute Renal Failure
Continued worsening of creatinine and near
   anuria.
   -Will move to catheter placement today if no brisk response seen for
   diuretics
   -Lytes/Acid-Base status appears reasonable.
   4)Hypertension-
   -Atenolol to continue
   -TNG weaned to off

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple myeloma. The patient has shown significant improvement in respiratory failure, allowing for weaning of PEEP and transition to PSV. However, he still retains severe oliguria and worsening renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Despite improvement in oxygenation, the patient's volume overload may hinder extubation. Weaning sedation, continuing antibiotics, and moving to CVVH to remove excess volume may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is receiving Meropenem, and it is essential to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to worsen, and near anuria is present. Moving to catheter placement may be necessary if diuretics do not show a brisk response.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with Atenolol, and TNG has been weaned off. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of medication as needed is crucial.
5. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance data shows a significant amount of fluid intake, which may exacerbate his respiratory failure and oliguria. Monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential to prevent further volume overload.
6. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being managed with antibiotics, and close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary to adjust treatment as needed.
7. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's underlying cancer may affect his response to treatment and increase the risk of complications.
8. Nutritional concerns: The patient is receiving Nutren Renal, and close monitoring of his nutritional status is essential to prevent malnutrition and related complications.
9. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are being monitored, and adjustments to his insulin regimen may be necessary to maintain tight glycemic control.
10. Infection control: The patient is at risk for VAP, and strict infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the development of VAP.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition, adjust treatment as needed, and consider consulting with specialists to optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: TF for now, if elevated residuals can re-start TPN, continue
   Reglan for gastric dysmotility
   Glycemic Control:  insulin standing and sliding scale

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) 14 days prior to admission.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are highly suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of sepsis and known parainfluenza pneumonia.
* Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial altered mental status due to infection, hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, and hyponatremia.
* E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, which is being treated with meropenem.
* Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is likely multifactorial and possibly related to acyclovir-induced ARF.
* Anemia: The patient has a hematocrit of 20, which has decreased from 25 on the previous day.
* Myeloma: The patient is in the early stages of SCT for multiple myeloma and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progressive respiratory failure due to ARDS
* Worsening of altered mental status due to infection, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia
* Development of septic shock due to E. coli bacteremia
* Further decline in renal function due to ARF
* Development of bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive therapy

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue meropenem for E. coli bacteremia and UTI
* Continue CVVH for ARF
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment as necessary
* Continue immunosuppressive therapy for myeloma
* Monitor for signs of bleeding complications and adjust platelet transfusions as necessary
* Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as necessary
* Continue to monitor and manage respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ICU Care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 145 kg obese individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and undergoing meropenem desensitization. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 156/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus tachycardia with frequent premature atrial contractions. 

The patient has a right-sided portacath and a left-sided tunneled catheter over an erythematous patch, which may be an old radiation therapy site. The patient is unable to assess jugular venous distension due to their 12-17 obese habitus. 

Laboratory results show the following: white blood cell count 6.8 K/uL, hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL, platelet count 68 K/uL, creatinine 7.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen 120 mg/dL. 

The patient has been receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin, and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient has a fever greater than 101°F and has been treated with hydrocortisone and ceftriaxone. 

The patient has a high risk of line infection, sinus infection, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, a peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 34 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen of 99 mmHg. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high fever, tachycardia, and respiratory distress suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Line infection: The patient's risk of line infection is high due to the presence of multiple central lines and the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Sinus infection: The patient's fever and sinus tenderness suggest the possibility of sinus infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis is high due to their immobility and the presence of central lines.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and sinus tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest the possibility of renal failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   -BMT recs: CSA 50IV or 75 PO it taking TF (not taking TF)
   -renal recs: 160 mg IV Lasix x1 dose, then start CVVH
   -cont meropenem, mica; vancomycin stopped
   -hct 20-->transfused 1U PRBCs
   -fever > 101. Blood Cx already sent from am. Urine Cx added on. Concern
   for line infection, sinus infection, DVT.
   -CXR:  no change from previous. Bilateral parenchymal opacity persists

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He is currently day +14 of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of sepsis and known parainfluenza pneumonia. His PaO2:FiO2 ratio is <200, indicating severe hypoxia. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's mental status is altered, likely multifactorial in origin, with a possibility of infection, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia contributing factors. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were negative. The patient is receiving meropenem for ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and his CSF studies are pending.

The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin, with a possibility of acyclovir-related acute renal failure. He is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) per renal team recommendation.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a hematocrit of 20, and is receiving guaiac all stools and transfusions for <21.

The patient's myeloma is being managed with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and ursodiol per BMT protocol.

The patient has hyponatremia, likely related to SIADH, and is receiving free water restriction and CVVH.

The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is difficult to control in the setting of infection, underlying diabetes, and steroids. He is receiving humalog sliding scale with Lantus.

The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with metoprolol and amlodipine. He has a history of depression and is receiving psychiatric input.

The patient has a number of other medical conditions, including glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, and GERD.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control with insulin, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Fevers: blood clot versus drug-related versus line infection versus
   urinary tract infection versus sinusitis
   -LE dopplers to look for DVT
   -f/u infectious disease recs
   -CT sinuses
   -CMV vL
   -consider pulling lines
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops
   # Hyperlipidemia
   -holding atorvastatin in acute setting
   # Peripheral Neuropathy and Pain
   -stopped neurontin per renal recs
   # GERD
   -continue lansoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS, and his PaO2:FiO2 ratio is less than 200. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.
* Fever: The patient has a temperature greater than 101.8°F (38.8°C) and is being treated for suspected line infection, sinus infection, and DVT.
* Altered mental status: The patient is intubated and sedated, and his mental status is likely multifactorial related to infection, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia.
* E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli UTI and is currently being treated with meropenem.
* Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, and his creatinine level is 7.0 mg/dL. He is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is 20%, and he is receiving transfusions for anemia.
* Myeloma: The patient is in the post-transplant period for multiple myeloma and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 120 mg/dL and is being treated with free water restriction and CVVH.
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of diabetes and is receiving insulin therapy.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving metoprolol and amlodipine.
* Depression: The patient has a history of major depression and is receiving duloxetine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress can progress to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and UTI can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ARF can progress to AKI, which can require dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's line infection, sinus infection, and DVT can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes and steroid therapy can cause hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension can worsen to a hypertensive crisis, which can cause end-organ damage.
7. Depression: The patient's depression can worsen, leading to suicidal ideation or behavior.

To address these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring and treatment according to the ICU care plan. The patient's family should also be educated on his condition and the importance of following the care plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin

   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently in the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates on CXR, suggestive of ARDS, and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The goal is to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials.
* Fevers: The patient has ongoing fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes blood clot, drug-related, line infection, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis. LE dopplers will be performed to look for DVT, and the patient will be followed up with infectious disease recommendations.
* Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, related to infection, hypercarbia, and hyponatremia. The patient will continue to receive treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia, and CSF studies will be followed up.
* E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: The patient has ongoing ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and will continue to receive meropenem.
* ARF: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial, and will continue to receive CVVH.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased to 20, and will be transfused for <21.
* Myeloma: The patient is currently day +14 post-SCT, and will continue to receive cyclosporine and other immunosuppressive medications.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely related to SIADH, and will be monitored daily.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose is difficult to control, and will continue to receive insulin and other medications.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and will continue to receive metoprolol and amlodipine.
* Depression: The patient has a history of major depression, and will be followed up with psychiatry recommendations.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a history of glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy and pain, and GERD, and will continue to receive medications for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Sepsis: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and UTI, and there is a risk of sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers and is at risk of developing further infections.
* Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and is at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GERD and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. He has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has been tolerating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) support well. He has had persistent fevers, which are being investigated as possible sources, including sinusitis and catheter-related infections. His respiratory status is stable, but his renal function is still compromised.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if PEEP support is reduced or discontinued.
2. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and ongoing fevers, which may indicate sepsis. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is still compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if CVVH is discontinued or reduced.
4. Catheter-related infections: The patient has a dialysis catheter and a tunneled line, which may be prone to infection. If not properly managed, catheter-related infections can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a risk of DVT due to immobility and the presence of central lines. If left untreated, DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of central lines. If left untreated, gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Infection: The patient has a risk of infection due to the presence of central lines and the use of immunosuppressive medications. If left untreated, infection can lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Plan:

1. Continue PEEP support and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Investigate the source of the patient's fevers and treat accordingly.
3. Continue CVVH and monitor the patient's renal function closely.
4. Consider moving the patient to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) if CVVH is no longer necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's central lines for signs of infection and remove them if necessary.
6. Consider using anticoagulant therapy to prevent DVT.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and take measures to prevent bleeding if necessary.
8. Consider using antimicrobial therapy to prevent infection.
9. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take measures to prevent infection if necessary."

   sinusitis, or to intubation.
   2. Interval opacification in the air cells of the left mastoid, and
   left middle ear.
   3. Chronic changes in the right mastoid with opacification likely from
   remote surgical procedure. Please correlate clinically.
   - Lower extremity doppler: Limited examination due to body habitus, but
   no definite evidence of DVT of either lower extremity. Limited
   evaluation of the mid superficial femoral vein bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man now Day +14 of allogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment
   syndrome as in correct time frame and given increased WBC per Heme-Onc.
   BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen,
   negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 7416**] vent (goal Vt 4mg/kg IBW per ARDS protocol)
   -continue to wean PEEP and try daily pressure support trials;
   spontaneous breathing trial today
   -continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -continue micafungin
   -improvement in respiratory status will largely depend upon improving
   renal function, as well as tx of pneumonia as above
   # Fevers: blood clot versus drug-related versus line infection versus
   urinary tract infection versus sinusitis
   -LE dopplers to look for DVT
   -f/u infectious disease recs
   -CT sinuses
   -CMV vL
   -consider pulling lines
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -daily blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   # Anemia: hematocrit 20 decreased from 25 on [**2165-3-20**].
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is now day +14 of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus,
 dose as patient is NPO
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to
   decreasing sedation and agitation.  Unable to assess if patient in
   pain.
   -continue metoprolol and amlodipine
   -consider restarted nitro gtt if hypertensive
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -appreciate psychiatry input
   -hold duloxetine for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma and is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest CT, which is highly suggestive of ARDS. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is <200, which indicates severe hypoxia.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 136 beats per minute. The patient's blood pressure is 125/52 mmHg, which is slightly elevated.
* Renal status: The patient has oliguric renal failure and is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* Neurological status: The patient is intubated and sedated, and is not arousable to voice. The patient's mental status is altered, and the patient is at risk for further deterioration.
* Infectious status: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and is currently receiving meropenem. The patient's BAL viral screen is positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen, and the patient's CSF studies are negative to date.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL and a platelet count of 86 x 10^9/L.
* Fluid balance: The patient has a significant fluid imbalance, with a total fluid input of 2,421 mL and a total fluid output of 6,327 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -3,906 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Sepsis: The patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to anuria, which can be life-threatening.
* Infection: The patient's altered mental status and immunocompromised state make him at risk for further infections.
* Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and coagulopathy make him at risk for bleeding.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen his renal failure and other organ dysfunction.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's hypokalemia can worsen his cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI with meropenem.
* Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with CVVH and dose adjustment of medications.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid management as needed.
* Monitor the patient's hematological status and adjust platelet transfusions as needed.
* Consider restarting cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil once the patient's renal function improves.
* Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Consider restarting atorvastatin and holding duloxetine.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust anticonvulsant therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Respiratory distress: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza pneumonia given PaO2:FiO2 <200. Ddx also includes volume
   overload from renal failure, post-transplant reaction and engraftment

   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma 14 days prior to admission. He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and pain.

Current Status:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200, suggestive of ARDS. He has bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest CT and a BAL viral screen positive for parainfluenza type 3 viral antigen.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving metoprolol and amlodipine. His blood pressure is 125/52 mmHg, and his heart rate is 136 beats per minute.
* Renal: The patient has oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial, and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* Infectious: The patient has ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and is receiving meropenem. He also has a positive BAL viral screen for parainfluenza type 3.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, likely multifactorial, and is receiving sedation and pain management.
* Other: The patient has hyponatremia, likely related to SIADH, and is receiving free water restriction and CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory: ARDS may progress to respiratory failure, and the patient may require increased ventilatory support.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure may continue to fluctuate, and he may require increased cardiovascular support.
3. Renal: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, and he may require further dialysis or nephrology consultation.
4. Infectious: The patient may develop further infections, such as line infections or urinary tract infections, and may require additional antibiotics.
5. Neurological: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, and he may require increased sedation or neurological consultation.
6. Gastrointestinal: The patient may develop gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications related to his medications.
7. Hematological: The patient's anemia may worsen, and he may require transfusions.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilatory support as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiovascular status, including blood pressure and heart rate.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's renal function, including CVVH and diuretics.
4. Continue to manage the patient's infections, including antibiotics and line care.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and pain management as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medications as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hematological status and adjust transfusions as needed."

   1. Mucosal thickening and fluid level in the paranasal sinuses, with
   interval worsening compared to prior study, and could be due to
   sinusitis, or to intubation.
   2. Interval opacification in the air cells of the left mastoid, and
   left middle ear.
   3. Chronic changes in the right mastoid with opacification likely from
   remote surgical procedure. Please correlate clinically.
   - Lower extremity doppler: Limited examination due to body habitus, but
   no definite evidence of DVT of either lower extremity. Limited
   evaluation of the mid superficial femoral vein bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory failure: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS given P:F <200 in setting of sepsis and
   known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also
   includes volume overload from renal failure and now question of
   pulmonary embolism. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome
   less likely.
   -Cont to mechanically vent; unable to tolerate SBT today; retry
   tomorrow
   -Cntinue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess
   -Appreciate ID recs
   -Continue current abx
   -CT torso
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. Will order TTE to evaluate
   for R heart strain. [**Month (only) 51**] also be able to see evidence of RV enlargement
   on CT chest w/o contrast.
   -Check diff for eos, urine eos to r/o drug fever
   -Await cx data from pulled line. Consider pulling portacath if
   continuing to spike.
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -CIS, f/u blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses; will
   start on amiodarone gtt which may also help remain in sinus rhythm
   should cardioversion become necessary
   -PE workup as above
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR <10
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level (50mg IV today, recheck CSA level tomorrow
   at 9pm); goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust

   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Here had required
   addition of nitro gtt but currently more hypotensive.
   -Hold metoprolol and amlodipine
   -Amiodarone for afib
   -CVVH as above; will avoid large fluid shifts

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, ARDS, and sepsis, and is being mechanically ventilated. He also has fevers, likely due to PE or drug-related causes, and is being treated with heparin and antibiotics. He has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial, and is being treated with CVVH. He has altered mental status, likely due to infection and hypercarbia, and is being treated with antibiotics and sedatives. He has anemia, and his myeloma is being managed with immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of ESBL E. coli bacteremia and the presence of bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest CT, PE is a potential complication that needs to be ruled out.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, and CVVH may be needed to support renal function.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and altered mental status may be due to sepsis, and ongoing antibiotic therapy is necessary to manage this condition.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and mechanical ventilation may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fevers may be due to infection, and ongoing antibiotic therapy is necessary to manage this condition.
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and the presence of indwelling lines may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the use of steroids may lead to hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and titrate FiO2 to maintain SpO2 > 95%.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust CVVH as necessary.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for ESBL E. coli bacteremia and consider adding empiric antibiotics for PE.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and hyperglycemia with medication and insulin therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation therapy as necessary.
7. Consider performing a pulmonary embolism workup, including V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram, to rule out PE.
8. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary."

   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability noted have had
   favorable RSBI this morning.  BP control has actually required IV
   medications for stbilization.  However, patient does have persistent
   fevers noted.  We have been considering possible sources for the low
   grade fevers with typical ICU infections such as sinusitis being
   considered and with possible seeding of catheters being raised as
   possibliity with surveillance blood cultures now negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR last night
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today, SBT but will not extubate given
   procedures and overnight events
   -on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on Meropenem
   after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.  He,
   however, has had ongoing fevers without etiology identified
   -Micafungin/Meropenem
   -Will need to re-image for Sinus infection
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - agree with amio IV load

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability noted have had
   favorable RSBI this morning.  BP control has actually required IV
   medications for stbilization.  However, patient does have persistent
   fevers noted.  We have been considering possible sources for the low
   grade fevers with typical ICU infections such as sinusitis being
   considered and with possible seeding of catheters being raised as
   possibliity with surveillance blood cultures now negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR last night
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today, SBT but will not extubate given
   procedures and overnight events
   -on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on Meropenem
   after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.  He,
   however, has had ongoing fevers without etiology identified
   -Micafungin/Meropenem
   -Will need to re-image for Sinus infection
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - agree with amio IV load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) for multiple myeloma and is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has had persistent fevers.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.5°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 142 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished appearance
* Normal cardiovascular examination
* Tachycardic
* Respiratory examination shows crackles in both bases
* Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory failure: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   were highly suggestive of ARDS given P:F <200 in setting of sepsis and
   known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also
   includes volume overload from renal failure and now question of
   pulmonary embolism. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome
   less likely.
   -Cont to mechanically vent; unable to tolerate SBT today; retry
   tomorrow
   -Cntinue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess
   -Appreciate ID recs
   -Continue current abx
   -CT torso
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. Will order TTE to evaluate
   for R heart strain. [**Month (only) 51**] also be able to see evidence of RV enlargement
   on CT chest w/o contrast.
   -Check diff for eos, urine eos to r/o drug fever
   -Await cx data from pulled line. Consider pulling portacath if
   continuing to spike.
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -CIS, f/u blood cultures
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses; will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and pain. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, and is being treated for sepsis, ARDS, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Mechanically ventilated, with P:F ratio <200, and bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of ARDS.
* Cardiovascular status: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 116 bpm, and borderline BP, requiring vasopressors.
* Renal status: Oliguric renal failure, with a creatinine level of 8.2 mg/dL, and a GFR <10 mL/min.
* Neurological status: Altered mental status, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12.
* Infectious status: ESBL E. coli bacteremia, with a positive blood culture, and a suspected line infection or sinusitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, and is at risk for developing a secondary pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient is already septic, and may develop further complications such as organ dysfunction or death.
* ARF: The patient has oliguric renal failure, and may require further management, including dialysis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, and may be at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, and may be at risk for further neurological complications such as seizures or brain edema.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of DVT, and may be at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Vasopressors to maintain BP
* CVVH for renal failure
* Antibiotics for ESBL E. coli bacteremia
* Heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis
* Lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Vent precautions for VAP prevention
* Nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
* Ursodiol for cholestasis prevention
* Mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression
* Cyclosporine for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis
* Acyclovir for viral suppression"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   # Respiratory failure: Quickly evolving bilateral patchy infiltrates
   consistent with ARDS given P:F <200 in setting of sepsis and known
   parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia. Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes
   volume overload from renal failure and now question of pulmonary
   embolism. Post-transplant reaction and engraftment syndrome less
   likely.  Concern for PE with increased tachycardia and acute
   desaturation
   -Cont to mechanically vent; unable to tolerate SBT today; retry
   tomorrow
   -Cntinue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess. No peripheral or urinary Eos. Sinusitis may be
   related to fever, but in current setting is less likely to be
   contributing as would expect so see some sinus thickening.
   -Appreciate ID recs
   -Cx data negative to date.
   -Continue current abx
   -CT torso
 F/u final read
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. Will order TTE to evaluate
   for R heart strain. [**Month (only) 51**] also be able to see evidence of RV enlargement
   on CT chest w/o contrast.
   -Await cx data from pulled line. Consider pulling portacath if
   continuing to spike.
   # E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx now with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -continue meropenem
   -will leave lines in for now, pending surveillance cultures
   -CIS, f/u blood cultures
 Cx negative since [**3-16**].
   -f/u allergy and ID recs
   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses;
   Started on Amiodarone gtt with mild improvement initially but still
   tachy into the 120-130s.  Concern for underfilling in setting of CVVH,
   fevers, less likely PE.
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated (but not oversedated as BP running
   low).
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to
   his altered mental status.
   -continue treatment for ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem
   -CSF studies negative to date. Continue to follow up other culture
   data.
   -appreciate psychiatry recs
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level (50mg IV today, recheck CSA level tomorrow
   at 9pm); goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently stable.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per tube feed status
   # Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension in the past
   requiring metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 2.5 qday. Here had required
   addition of nitro gtt but currently more hypotensive.
   -Hold metoprolol and amlodipine
   -Amiodarone for afib
   -CVVH as above; will avoid large fluid shifts
   -[**Month (only) 51**] need to start pressors if unable to maintain MAP>60-65

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Fevers: PE (negative LENIs) versus drug-related (?meropenem despite
   desensitization) versus line infection versus sinusitis versus
   abdominal abscess. No peripheral or urinary Eos. Sinusitis may be
   related to fever, but in current setting is less likely to be
   contributing as would expect so see some sinus thickening.

   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use metoprolol or dilt boluses;
   Started on Amiodarone gtt with mild improvement initially but still
   tachy into the 120-130s.  Concern for underfilling in setting of CVVH,
   fevers, less likely PE.
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated (but not oversedated as BP running
   low).
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to infection and
   hypercarbia related to parainfluenza, further worsened by hyponatremia.
   Lumbar puncture was performed on [**2165-3-15**]; 1 WBC difficult to interpret
   in the setting of neutropenia but nl glucose and total protein
   reassuring. Additional infection is also possible, although cultures
   remain NGTD for additional infection. Hyponatremia has been relatively
   chronic during this admission and is likely not a large contributor to

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, and pain.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure with bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with ARDS
* Afib with RVR despite metoprolol IV
* Renal failure with oliguria and elevated creatinine
* Hypertension despite holding antihypertensive medications
* Hyponatremia, likely related to SIADH
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus, difficult to control due to infection and steroids
* Altered mental status, likely multifactorial
* ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) with increased tachycardia and acute desaturation
2. Underfilling in setting of CVVH, fevers, and less likely PE
3. Acute renal failure (ARF) due to acyclovir-related toxicity
4. Infection-related sepsis and organ dysfunction
5. Hypotension and decreased cardiac output due to AFib and RVR
6. Volume overload and fluid imbalance due to ARF and CVVH
7. Hyperglycemia and glucose control issues due to infection and steroids
8. Nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition due to prolonged ICU stay and TF hold
9. Increased risk of bleeding and thrombocytopenia due to anticoagulation and CVVH
10. Increased risk of infection and sepsis due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Administering antibiotics for ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI
* Managing hypertension with amiodarone and CVVH
* Managing diabetes with insulin and sliding scale
* Monitoring and managing hyponatremia with free water restriction and CVVH
* Continuing CVVH for renal failure
* Monitoring for signs of PE and underfilling
* Considering TTE to evaluate for RV enlargement and R heart strain
* Following up with ID recs and allergy recs
* Holding acyclovir due to suspected acyclovir-related ARF
* Considering pressors if unable to maintain MAP >60-65."

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - now on IV amio load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - now on IV amio load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis, and hypotension. He has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has had ongoing low-grade fevers without identified etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the etiology is unclear. The patient is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism (PE) and may require further investigation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a complication of his underlying disease and may require further intervention, such as intermittent hemodialysis.
3. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient's sepsis and hypotension may be related to his underlying infection, and further investigation is needed to identify the source of the infection.
4. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma is a significant underlying condition that may require further treatment and monitoring.
5. Afib: The patient's atrial fibrillation (Afib) may require further management and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Access Issues: The patient's access issues, including his indwelling port and midline, may require further management and potential removal.
7. Cortical Insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol levels may indicate severe adrenal insufficiency, which may require further investigation and treatment.
8. Infection: The patient's ongoing low-grade fevers without identified etiology may indicate a potential infection, such as sinusitis, and further investigation is needed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further investigation for acute respiratory failure.
2. Continue CVVH for volume removal and consider intermittent hemodialysis for acute renal failure.
3. Further investigate the source of the patient's sepsis and hypotension, including blood cultures and imaging studies.
4. Continue to manage the patient's multiple myeloma and consider further treatment and monitoring.
5. Manage the patient's Afib and consider further anticoagulation therapy.
6. Manage the patient's access issues, including potential removal of the indwelling port and midline.
7. Consider further investigation and treatment for cortical insufficiency.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and consider further investigation and treatment as needed."

   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Cont heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80 for empiric tx of PE
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on improved
   renal function. HD deferred in favor of CVVH given lower running BP.
   Will ultrafiltrate as BP tolerates
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's health status and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Health Status:**

* The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression, who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
* He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has a history of parainfluenza pneumonia.
* He has oliguric renal failure, which is likely multifactorial, and is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* He has a fever of unknown origin, which is being treated with meropenem, and has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins.
* He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line in place.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of parainfluenza pneumonia, and his current ARDS may be related to this.
* Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of right ventricular dilation, and his tachycardia and acute desaturation may be indicative of a PE.
* Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is likely multifactorial, and is being treated with CVVH.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which may be related to his ESBL E. coli bacteremia or another underlying infection.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to ARDS, and his respiratory status may continue to deteriorate if his underlying condition is not improved.
* Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).
* Infection-Related Complications: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and is being treated with meropenem for ESBL E. coli bacteremia, which may increase his risk of infection-related complications.
* Nutritional Complications: The patient has a history of poor nutritional status and is currently being treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his ileus.

**Future Management:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
* Continue to treat his ESBL E. coli bacteremia with meropenem and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Continue to manage his oliguric renal failure with CVVH and monitor his electrolyte levels.
* Monitor his cardiac status and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor his nutritional status and adjust his TPN as needed.
* Monitor his mental status and adjust his sedation and analgesia as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - now on IV amio load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for multiple myeloma and is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. He is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has been febrile with low-grade fevers despite negative surveillance blood cultures.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure with acute hypoxia in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and respiratory failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure, which is being managed with CVVH.
3. Sepsis/hypotension, with ongoing low-grade fevers and a recent ESBL E. coli bacteremia, which has been treated with Meropenem.
4. Multiple Myeloma, for which the patient is receiving BMT support.
5. Atrial Fibrillation, which is being managed with IV amiodarone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections, which could worsen the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis or septic shock, which could further compromise the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status.
3. Renal failure, which could progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed effectively.
4. Adrenal insufficiency, which could be exacerbated by the patient's chronic steroid use and the recent stress dose of steroids.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), which could be exacerbated by the patient's immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Catheter-related infections, which could be a source of ongoing sepsis and bacteremia.
7. Organ failure, including respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular failure, which could lead to a poor prognosis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular status, as well as his sepsis and adrenal function."

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - now on IV amio load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure-with acute hypoxia in the setting of afib
   with RVR
   -unclear etiology, at risk of PE, was febrile ?transient bacteremia
   post Hickman removal
   -Versed/Fentanyl low dose but would decrease sedation further
   -PSV well tolerated
will continue to support through continued volume
   removal and wean today with SBT.
   -Trial decrease PEEP again today to 5, SBT
   - on IV heparin empirically
   - check PE to r/a RV, signs of PE, etc.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward.
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - now on IV amio load
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who has undergone a bone marrow transplant (BMT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU with progressive respiratory failure and renal failure. The patient's condition is complex, and multiple medical complications are present.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 124 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 131/64 mmHg (84/111 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a history of hypertension, benign alteration in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, acute, and multiple myeloma. He is currently on CVVH for volume removal and has had a recent episode of febrile neutropenia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 108 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 6.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22.5 mg/dL
* Sodium (Na): 134 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.4 mEq/L
* Chloride (Cl): 99 mEq/L
* Calcium (Ca): 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Not significantly changed from previous study
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: Not performed

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Fecal culture: Not performed due to patient having been hospitalized for >3 days
* Campylobacter culture: Not performed due to patient having been hospitalized for >3 days
* Clostridium difficile toxin A & B test: Feces negative for C. difficile toxin A & B by EIA

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute hypoxia in the setting of atrial fibrillation (afib) with right ventricular failure (RVR). The etiology is unclear, and the patient is at risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and will have a trial decrease in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 5 cmH2O.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient will continue to receive CVVH for volume removal and will have a trial of intermittent hemodialysis (HD) going forward.
3. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has had ongoing low-grade fevers without identified etiology. The patient is being treated with Meropenem, and blood cultures are free of organisms. The patient will have a repeat CT chest/abdomen today to rule out occult infection.
4. Multiple Myeloma: The patient will continue to receive post-BMT support and care.
5. Afib: The patient is currently on IV amiodarone load.
6. Access: The patient has a double-lumen midline and a port (which may need to be removed).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Sepsis
* Renal failure
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Catheter-related infections
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulcer bleeding
* Vascular access complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 145 kg male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, type II, renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), multiple myeloma (cancer, malignant neoplasm), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, acute lung injury). The patient is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of ARDS and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He is tachycardic and hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 190s mmHg. The patient has been receiving various medications, including amiodarone, metoprolol, and nitroglycerin, and has been undergoing continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to hypertensive crisis, cardiac complications, and cerebral edema.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and CVVH is being used to manage fluid overload. However, this may not be sufficient to prevent acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the underlying ARDS and potential lung injury.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is at risk of developing sepsis, particularly with the use of immunosuppressive medications.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is at risk of bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of thrombocytopenia.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly with the use of immunosuppressive medications and the presence of a central venous catheter.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and multiple myeloma may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of multiple myeloma may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as spinal cord compression and peripheral neuropathy.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust medication as necessary to prevent hypertensive crisis.
2. Continue CVVH to manage fluid overload and prevent acute kidney injury.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust anticoagulant medications as necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust antibiotics as necessary to prevent infection.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medication as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust medication as necessary to prevent neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

* The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) for multiple myeloma and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).
* The patient is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has persistent low-grade fevers, which may be due to sepsis, drug fever, or occult ICU infection.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and esbl e coli bacteremia, which has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is on heparin empirically due to the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and colonization of the respiratory tract.
	* Respiratory failure due to ARDS, which may worsen with continued volume overload and anasarca.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to AFib with RVR, which may worsen with continued stress from mechanical ventilation and fluid overload.
	* Cardiac failure due to decreased cardiac output and increased afterload.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ARF, which may worsen with continued fluid overload and anasarca.
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to prolonged exposure to nephrotoxic medications and underlying multiple myeloma.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis due to ongoing bacteremia and potential occult ICU infection.
	* Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) due to colonization of the CVC.
5. Nutritional Complications:
	* Malnutrition due to poor oral intake, high residuals, and difficulty with enteral nutrition.
	* Electrolyte imbalance due to malnutrition and ongoing fluid and electrolyte losses.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia due to ongoing bleeding, malnutrition, and underlying multiple myeloma.
	* Thrombocytopenia due to ongoing bleeding, malnutrition, and underlying multiple myeloma.
7. Other Complications:
	* Fluid overload and anasarca due to continued volume administration and ARF.
	* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy and ongoing glucose loss.
	* Hyperkalemia due to ongoing potassium loss and underlying multiple myeloma.

Given the patient's complex medical status, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent worsening of his condition."

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 yo male s/p BMT for multiple myeloma now with progressive
   respiratory failure and renal failure now on CVVH for volume removal in
   the setting of persistent anuria.  He has had continued good tolerance
   of PSV wean and with improved blood pressure stability. We have been
   considering possible sources for the low grade fevers with typical ICU
   infections such as sinusitis being considered and with possible seeding
   of catheters being raised as possibliity with surveillance blood
   cultures all negative.
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure/ARDS/volume overload
   appears multifactorial
   -worsening acute hypoxia in the setting of afib with RVR
   -? PE
   parainfluenze and treating for esbl bactermia
   fevers --now on cvvh so unreliable
   volume overloaded
   attempt fluid removal
   continue antibx
   continue vent suypport--would trial PS again once heart rates under
   better control
   continue IV heparin empirically as unable to defintieiyl rule out  at
   tbhis time and relatively high  linical suspicion
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal today
   -renal team consider moving to intermittent HD going forward as BP
   tolerate (afib and HR may limit this)
   3)Sepsis/hypotension
patient with ESBL e coli bacteremia and started on
   Meropenem after desensitization with blood cultures free of organisms.
   He, however, has had ongoing low grade fevers without etiology
   identified. ? drug fever vs occult infection ? sinusitis
   -continue Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   -Removing Port to be discussed with ID--fever curve unreliable given
   CVVH
   -Will f/u on all cultures, check diff for eos (?drug fever), CT
   chest/abd today
   -cortisol on [**3-11**] was 0.4. Will repeat today and likely add stress dose
   steroids. Consider severe adrenal insufficiency
   4)Multiple Myeloma-
   -Continue per BMT support in post BMT Rx
   5) Afib - making slow progress with rate control
   on metoprolo 50 TID, amio, and dig
   concern that not absorbing metoprolol PO--would change to QID
   metoprolol--consider changing to drip dilt or esmolol and relaoding
   with amio
   repeat TTE
   follow dig level
   6) Access - double lumen midline + port (which may need to be removed),
   HD cath
   will need additional picc or CVL for access and tpn, given bacteremia
   and infections would plan to remove port--will discuss with surgery

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. He has a history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and has been receiving antibiotics for suspected ESBL bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and his partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 275 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: He has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, and his blood pressure is 139/67 mmHg.
* Renal: He is on CVVH for volume removal, and his creatinine level is 6.3 mg/dL.
* Infection: He has ongoing low-grade fevers without a clear etiology, and his blood cultures are negative.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to increased oxygen requirements, ventilator-associated lung injury, and increased risk of mortality.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can progress, leading to organ dysfunction, increased risk of mortality, and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury can worsen, leading to increased risk of chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, and mortality.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's suspected severe adrenal insufficiency can worsen, leading to decreased cortisol levels, electrolyte imbalance, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Central line-associated bloodstream infection: The patient's central line can become infected, leading to bacteremia, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's catheter can become infected, leading to bacteremia, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Pneumonia: The patient can develop pneumonia, leading to increased risk of mortality, prolonged ICU stay, and increased risk of secondary infections.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient can develop ventilator-associated pneumonia, leading to increased risk of mortality, prolonged ICU stay, and increased risk of secondary infections.
9. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to cardiac dysfunction, including decreased cardiac output, increased heart rate, and increased risk of mortality.
10. Increased risk of bleeding: The patient's sepsis can lead to increased risk of bleeding, including bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and mucous membranes.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing complications due to his underlying medical conditions and the interventions he is receiving. Close monitoring and aggressive management of his condition are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for multiple myeloma and developed esbl e coli bacteremia, leading to progressive respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is on mechanical ventilation with a high inspiratory pressure (PIP) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is on CVVH for volume removal, and transition to hemodialysis (HD) is limited due to AFib with RVR.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had ESBL e coli bacteremia and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but has persistent low-grade fevers without a clear etiology.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had hypotension and is on vasopressors.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an abnormal potassium level and is at risk for adrenal insufficiency.
6. Nutrition: The patient has poor nutritional status and is at risk for malnutrition.
7. Access: The patient has a port and may require removal, and will need additional access for feeding and medication administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute lung injury, or worsening of ARDS.
2. Acute renal failure: Further decline in renal function, need for dialysis, or development of dialysis-related complications.
3. Sepsis: Development of multi-organ failure, septic shock, or death.
4. Hypotension: Further decline in blood pressure, need for vasopressors, or development of vasopressor-related complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: Development of life-threatening electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.
6. Nutrition: Malnutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, or development of nutrition-related complications, such as sepsis or wound infections.
7. Access: Development of line-related complications, such as infection or thrombosis, or need for additional access procedures.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation and CVVH for volume removal.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
3. Rate control medications for AFib with RVR.
4. CVVH for volume removal and possible transition to HD.
5. TPN or PPN for nutritional support.
6. Removal of port and possible insertion of additional access lines.
7. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and treatment of electrolyte imbalances.
8. Monitoring of respiratory and renal function, and treatment of complications as needed."

   Imaging: [**3-25**] CXR: Right sided PICC line terminating in mid axilla.
   Left sided subclavian line with tip terminating in probable superior
   SVC. No change in multifocal airspace opacities.
   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

   # Respiratory failure: ARDS , known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.
   Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes volume overload from renal failure
   and likely question of pulmonary embolism. Concern for PE with
   increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation.
   -Pesp staus improving: transition to pressure support
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on volume
   removal: continue CVVH
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. TTE demonstrating R heart
   strain suggestive of PE. Consider lytics for acute decline

   low).
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, who was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has developed acute renal failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and is suspected to have pulmonary embolism. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is receiving multiple medications, including heparin, metoprolol, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation on TTE are consistent with pulmonary embolism. If left untreated, this could lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis secondary to ESBL E. coli bacteremia, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely multifactorial, and if left untreated, could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's AFib with RVR is likely due to an adrenergic surge, and if left untreated, could lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, and death.
5. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including ESBL E. coli bacteremia, parainfluenza pneumonia, and likely pulmonary embolism, which could lead to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
6. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload from renal failure and likely pulmonary embolism could lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiovascular status.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia could lead to seizures, coma, and death if left untreated.
9. Ileus: The patient's ileus could lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and death if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin, to treat the patient's infections.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis, as needed.
4. Consider anticoagulation therapy, such as heparin, to treat the patient's suspected pulmonary embolism.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, and correct any imbalances.
6. Continue to provide nutrition, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), to support the patient's nutritional needs.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
8. Continue to provide pain management, including opioids and non-opioid medications, to manage the patient's pain.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and provide supportive care, including sedation and analgesia, as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma and was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and depression. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, and is also experiencing acute renal failure, anemia, and hyponatremia.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including the removal of an indwelling port and placement of a new line, and has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and immunosuppressants. He has also had several laboratory tests, including blood cultures, chest X-rays, and echocardiograms, which have revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or other significant cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation are concerning for pulmonary embolism, which could be exacerbated by his immobility and central venous catheters.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely multifactorial, and may be related to hypotension, increased lactate, volume depletion, and supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of ESBL E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and may be at risk for further infections, particularly given his prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and depression, combined with his current use of immunosuppressants and antivirals, may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of GERD and ileus may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of depression and recent use of immunosuppressants may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or cognitive impairment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely to detect any changes in his condition.
2. Consider performing a V/Q scan or CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infections with antibiotics and antivirals as directed by his healthcare providers.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medication dosing accordingly.
5. Consider using vasopressors to support the patient's blood pressure, particularly if he is at risk for hypotension.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to manage his symptoms.
7. Consider performing a CT scan of the abdomen to rule out gastrointestinal complications."

   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 133.1 kg male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and multiple myeloma. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and benign alteration in nutrition. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo (TTE) which showed right ventricular (RV) dilatation and hypokinesis, concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). He was taken to the operating room for removal of his right port and placement of a left subclavian line. Heparin was stopped for 6 hours pre- and post-procedure, and he was started on IV metoprolol and titrated up for RV failure.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, and meropenem. He is also receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin infusions. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased hemoglobin and albumin levels.

Imaging studies show a right-sided PICC line terminating in the mid-axilla, and a left-sided subclavian line with the tip terminating in the probable superior vena cava (SVC). A chest X-ray (CXR) shows multifocal airspace opacities, and a TTE shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, depressed LV systolic function, and dilated and hypokinetic RV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's TTE shows RV dilatation and hypokinesis, which is concerning for PE. This could lead to further deterioration in his respiratory status and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is severe and may require further intervention, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely to continue unless further interventions, such as dialysis, are implemented.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count suggest the possibility of infection. This could lead to sepsis, septic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Bleeding: The patient's heparin infusion and potential bleeding complications could lead to hemorrhagic complications, such as hematomas or bleeding into his lungs.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's depressed LV systolic function and dilated RV could lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's altered nutrition and potential malnutrition could lead to further complications, such as decreased immune function or muscle wasting."

   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: [**3-25**] CXR: Right sided PICC line terminating in mid axilla.
   Left sided subclavian line with tip terminating in probable superior
   SVC. No change in multifocal airspace opacities.
   [**3-25**] TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricle is not well seen.
   There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic
   function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
   with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
   dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
   be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
   a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left
   ventricular function is depressedl, focal wall motion cannot be fully
   assessed. The right ventricle is not well seen but is dilated and
   hypokinetic. The apical RV may have slightly better function. This
   finding could be consistent with a pulmonary embolus. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-2-7**], image
   quallity is substantially worse. The right and left ventricles appear
   dilated and hypokinetic on the current exam

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 133.1 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/58 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.7 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 100 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) of 4.4 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 38 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 10 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral multifocal airspace opacities on chest X-ray (CXR) and a dilated right ventricle with depressed free wall contractility on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral multifocal airspace opacities on CXR may indicate pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and LFTs may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. ARF: The patient's elevated Cr and BUN levels indicate ARF, which can worsen the patient's renal function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's dilated right ventricle with depressed free wall contractility on TTE may indicate PE, which can worsen the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
5. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and PTT may indicate a bleeding risk, which can worsen the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is unclear at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple myeloma who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and presumed pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). His cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.7-9.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 166-191 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.4-3.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 62-100 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-128 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* LDH: 528 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Lateral scoliosis, improved aeration bilaterally with edema and asbestosis
* Microbiology: CMV load pending, porta cath tip pending

The patient's clinical course is complicated by:

* Persistent low-grade fevers despite broad antibacterial and antifungal coverage
* Development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH)
* Sepsis, now improved off pressors
* Multiple myeloma, with ongoing post-BMT support

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing broad antibacterial and antifungal treatments
* Moving toward pressure support (PS) weans
* Attempting fluid removal with CVVH to better optimize for future wean
* Continuing IV heparin empirically for presumed PE
* Transitioning to hemodialysis (HD) in the near future
* Pursuing a tunnel line for dialysis
* Continuing Micafungin, Meropenem, and Vancomycin for sepsis
* Following digoxin levels for atrial fibrillation
* Continuing post-BMT support for multiple myeloma

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure and ARDS
* Progression of ARF and need for dialysis
* Development of catheter-related infections or sepsis
* Worsening atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response
* Recurrence of sepsis or development of new infections
* Hemorrhagic complications from anticoagulation therapy
* Gastrointestinal complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation and nutritional support

Given the patient's complex clinical course and multiple comorbidities, close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers are essential to optimize his care and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who has undergone a bone marrow transplant for multiple myeloma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Slowly improving, with continued need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Cardiac status: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with right ventricular failure (RVF), with a slow response to rate control medications.
* Renal status: Acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal.
* Hemodynamic status: Stable, with a heart rate of 121 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 124/71 mmHg.
* Infectious status: Low-grade fevers without identified etiology, with ongoing broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal treatment.
* Nutritional status: Poor, with high residuals making tube feeding (TF) difficult, and requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued respiratory failure and ARDS, potentially leading to further decline in lung function and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Persistent AF with RVF, potentially leading to further cardiac decompensation and increased risk of arrhythmias.
* Prolonged ARF, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
* Ongoing sepsis, potentially leading to further decline in hemodynamic stability and increased risk of organ dysfunction.
* Nutritional deficiencies, potentially leading to further decline in overall health and increased risk of complications.
* Increased risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter-related thrombosis due to ongoing use of central venous catheters.

Given the patient's complex medical status, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, renal, and infectious conditions, as well as his nutritional status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall male who weighs 132.7 kg, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, and type II diabetes mellitus. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 123/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), with normal electrolyte levels. The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing subclavian line placement, and microbiology results are pending for port-a-cath, Hickman catheter, and blood cultures.

The patient's medications include lopressor, metoprolol, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and vancomycin, among others. The patient's infusion lines include arterial, dialysis catheter, midline, and multi-lumen lines.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potentially leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, requiring dialysis and potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state due to multiple myeloma and diabetes mellitus increases the risk of infections, including sepsis and pneumonia.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants, including heparin, increases the risk of bleeding complications, including hematuria, melena, or hematemesis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus and use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can worsen, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and stroke.
9. Dehydration: The patient's fluid imbalance can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
10. Wound complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of wound complications, including infection and bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61 yo M s/p BMT for multiple myeloma c/b esbl e coli bacteremia with
   progressive respiratory failure/ards in setting of parainfluenza (pna)
   and presumed pe, acute renal failure on CVVH for volume removal. Course

   with rvr.
   # Acute Respiratory Failure
   # ARDS
   # parainfluenza pna
   #presumed PE
   Resp status is slowly improving.
   --continue broad antibx and antifungal treatment
   --move toward PS weans on vent
   --Ability to extubate is further complicated by volume
   overload----attempt fluid removal with cvvh as BP allows to better
   optimize for future wean
   --continue IV heparin for presumed PE, pt with multiple rfs and
   relatively high clinical suspicion and tte highly suggestive
   # ARF
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal
   --renal will likely transition to HD in near future
   --anticipate prolonged need for dialysis--will pursue tunnel line
   placement
   # Sepsis--now improved hemodynamics off pressors
   Continued low grade fevers without additional etiology identified
   despite broad coverage. Now with temps masked by cvvh.
       ? drug fever vs occult ICU infection such as sinusitis vs possible
   seeding of catheters, all old lines and port now out
   --continue Micafungin/Meropenem/Vanc
   --f/u cultures
   # Afib - making slow progress with rate control
   --on metoprolol IV and dig,
         if worsenign RVR in setting of wean would start drip dilt or

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT for multiple myeloma transferred to the
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem
   desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. Also with parainfuenza
   PNA; and new AFIB; concern for PE given new RV dilation
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS , known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.
   Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes volume overload from renal failure
   and likely question of pulmonary embolism. Concern for PE with
   increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation.
   -Pesp staus improving: transition to pressure support
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on volume
   removal: continue CVVH
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. TTE demonstrating R heart
   strain suggestive of PE. Consider lytics for acute decline
   .
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -Fever curve less sensitive now on CVVH
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin

   # Afib with RVR:
   [**Month/Day (2) 7453**]: Increased adrenergic surge [**12-17**] acute insult in setting of good
   substrate (known mild LA enlargement) v. PE
   -Low-running BP limits ability to use of dilt; Started on Amiodarone
   gtt with mild improvement initially but still tachy into the 120-130s.
   Amio discontinued on [**3-25**] as had little effect and lopressor switched
   to IV over concerns for absorption
   -if no improvement would start  drip dilt or esmolol and consider
   reload with amio
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated (but not oversedated as BP running
   low).
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently improving.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # ileus: High residuals making tfs difficult, nutritional status very
   poor
   -Will start TPN tomorrow, PPN ovrnight
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -appreciate [**Last Name (un) 303**] input
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status
   # Depression: Patient has a history of major depression with
   significant medication requirements.
   -holding duloxetine for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   PNA; and new AFIB; concern for PE given new RV dilation
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS , known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.
   Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes volume overload from renal failure
   and likely question of pulmonary embolism. Concern for PE with
   increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation.
   -Pesp staus improving: transition to pressure support
   -Avoiding steroids given parainfluenza
   -Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on volume
   removal: continue CVVH
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. TTE demonstrating R heart

   -Low-running BP limits ability to use of dilt; Started on Amiodarone
   gtt with mild improvement initially but still tachy into the 120-130s.
   Amio discontinued on [**3-25**] as had little effect and lopressor switched
   to IV over concerns for absorption
   -if no improvement would start  drip dilt or esmolol and consider
   reload with amio
   -Decrease adrenergic stimuli w/ Tylenol prn for fever, cont treating
   infection, keep adequately sedated (but not oversedated as BP running
   low).
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He developed sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ESBL E. coli bacteremia. He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and multiple myeloma.

Current condition:

* The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure.
* He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AFIB-RVR) and is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin.
* He has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal.
* He has a central line and a dialysis catheter in place.
* He has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins and is being treated with meropenem and vancomycin for sepsis.
* He has a history of diabetes mellitus and is being treated with insulin and sliding scale insulin.

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of parainfluenza pneumonia and is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for developing sepsis again due to his underlying medical conditions.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple myeloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a recent bone marrow transplant (BMT). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, and his respiratory system is being supported with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 412 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 191 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 3.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Glucose: 100 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Atrial fibrillation (AF)
* Hypertension
* Diabetes mellitus
* Renal failure, acute
* Multiple myeloma
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Sepsis
* Parainfluenza pneumonia (PNA)
* Presumed pulmonary embolism (PE)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for 14 days
* Empiric and antifungal treatment for suspected sepsis
* Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and renal support
* IV heparin for presumed PE
* TPN for nutritional support
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Monitoring of cyclo levels daily for multiple myeloma
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function
* Progression of renal failure
* Development of septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated lung injury and critical care myopathy
* Potential for tunnel line placement for prolonged dialysis needs
* Complications related to ileus, such as malnutrition and poor wound healing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) for multiple myeloma and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and sepsis. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFIB). The patient's condition is complicated by parainfluenza pneumonia, presumed pulmonary embolism (PE), and ongoing fevers. He is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for volume removal and is expected to transition to hemodialysis in the near future.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and ongoing respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in his respiratory status, including increased oxygen requirements and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's AFIB may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's ARF may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring long-term dialysis therapy.
4. Infection: The patient's ongoing fevers and sepsis may lead to further infection, including central nervous system (CNS) infection, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's ileus and poor gastrointestinal absorption may lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and potential oversedation may lead to delirium, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's multiple myeloma may progress, leading to further complications, including bone marrow failure, anemia, and bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, and renal function.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's sedation regimen to minimize the risk of oversedation and delirium.
3. Continue CVVH and anticipate transition to hemodialysis in the near future.
4. Consider placement of a tunnel line for prolonged dialysis therapy.
5. Continue antimicrobial therapy for presumed PE and ongoing fevers.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider TPN to ensure adequate caloric and nutritional support.
7. Consider reloading with amiodarone for rate control of AFIB and follow digoxin levels.
8. Continue close monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adjusting his fluid management to minimize the risk of electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 129.8 kg male with a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He is currently in the ICU with atrial fibrillation, and his vital signs are stable. He has been receiving various medications, including cyclosporine, heparin, fentanyl, and midazolam. His lab results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, and his white blood cell count is slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure or death.
4. Infection: The patient's multiple myeloma and immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of infection, particularly fungal or bacterial infections.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's multiple myeloma and immunosuppressive therapy may lead to liver dysfunction or failure.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's hyperglycemia and immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of pancreatitis.
8. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy and underlying medical conditions may increase his risk of sepsis.
9. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase his risk of venous thromboembolism.
10. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase his risk of pressure ulcers.

These are just some of the potential medical complications that the patient may face. It is essential to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; and new AFIB; concern for PE given new RV
   dilation.
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS , known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.
   Negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 7453**] also includes volume overload from renal failure
   and likely question of pulmonary embolism. Concern for PE with
   increased tachycardia, acute desaturation, and new RV dilation.
   - additional Improvement in respiratory status will largely depend on
   volume removal: continue CVVH
   -Continue empiric heparin gtt. Unable to do CTA given ARF. V/Q scan may
   not be informative given underlying pulm dz. TTE demonstrating R heart
   strain suggestive of PE. Consider lytics for acute decline
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on [**2165-2-26**] with
   subsequent clearance s/p aztreonam but [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] cx with ESBL
   bacteremia. Had been on aztreonam and gentamicin, now switched to
   meropenem per ID recs s/p successful desensitization given h/o
   anaphylaxis on penicillins.
   -Fever curve less sensitive now on CVVH
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   .
   # Afib with RVR: Metoprolol 15mg IV q4
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Likely multifactorial given hypotension
   in setting of intubation w/ increased lactate, volume depletion
   (?insensible losses), supratherapeutic cyclosporin levels, gentamicin,
   recent contrast load, and acyclovir. Urine sediment [**3-18**] with numerous
   crystals, believe acyclovir- thus acyclovir-related ARF is at the top
   of the differential.
   -continue CVVH per renal team; TUNNEL LINE TOMORROW FOR HD
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil;
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or
   pneumonia. Currently improving.
   -continue to monitor daily sodium
   -continue free water restriction
   -CVVH as above
   # ileus: High residuals making tfs difficult, nutritional status very
   poor
   -On TPN
   - KUB to eval for ileus
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status
   # Glaucoma
   -continue timolol eye drops

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma on day 0 (March 8). He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, and anemia. He is also on immunosuppressive therapy for myeloma and has a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: ARDS and known parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia.
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: ESBL E. coli UTI on March 26 with subsequent clearance, but with recent bacteremia.
* Afib with RVR: Metoprolol 15mg IV q4.
* ARF: Oliguric renal failure, likely multifactorial, with acyclovir-related ARF at the top of the differential.
* Anemia: Hematocrit stable, with improvement likely from CVVH fluid shifts.
* Hyponatremia: Most likely related to SIADH, secondary to pain and/or pneumonia.
* Ileus: High residuals making TPN difficult, with poor nutritional status.
* Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops.

The patient is currently on various medications, including cyclosporine, vancomycin, micafungin, metoprolol, and mycophenolate mofetil. He is also receiving CVVH for renal failure and has a tunnel line planned for HD tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) given new RV dilation and tachycardia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis and septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia and UTI.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute renal failure (ARF) due to multifactorial causes.
5. Electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyponatremia, due to SIADH.
6. Infection and sepsis due to ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to ileus and poor nutritional status.
8. Eye complications, such as increased intraocular pressure, due to glaucoma.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]

   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

* The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma on day 0 (2165-3-8).
* He was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
* The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including:
	+ Respiratory failure due to ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE, and volume overload requiring CVVH.
	+ Sepsis and E. coli bacteremia, with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin being used for treatment.
	+ Afib with RVR, requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV q4 to control heart rate.
	+ ARF due to multifactorial causes, including sepsis, hypotension, and Acyclovir-related factors.
	+ Anemia, with a stable hematocrit, and likely improvement due to CVVH fluid shifts.
	+ Myeloma, with a plan to dose cyclosporine per level and continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil.
	+ Hyponatremia, which is resolving.
	+ Ileus, exacerbated by narcotics, with no obstruction per KUB.
	+ Type 2 diabetes mellitus, with difficulty controlling blood glucose due to infection, underlying diabetes, and steroids.
	+ Glaucoma, with a plan to continue timolol eye drops.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further deterioration may occur due to underlying conditions such as ARDS, pneumonia, and volume overload.
* Sepsis and E. coli bacteremia: The patient's sepsis and bacteremia may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.
* Afib with RVR: The patient's heart rate may become unstable, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
* ARF: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremia.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery, or increased risk of bleeding.
* Myeloma: The patient's myeloma may relapse, leading to further complications such as bone marrow failure, infection, or organ dysfunction.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to further complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
* Ileus: The patient's ileus may persist or worsen, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess.
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to further complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or diabetic nephropathy.
* Glaucoma: The patient's glaucoma may worsen, leading to further complications such as vision loss, blindness, or increased intraocular pressure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia and mental
   status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   status no longer a factor.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE- hold for
   Femoral line removal, HD line placement
   - Continue Propofol sedation.
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 5mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Holding CVVH today pending renal recs.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   - Switch to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop overnight possibly from fluid collection.  No
   evidence of bleed but low threshold for scan given his heparin gtt.
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <25
   - With Hct drop, CT scan for RP bleed or thigh hematoma
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine 25mg IV BID
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Return of bowel sounds today, no stooling yet.
   -On TPN
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is complex, with ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, and possible PE. The patient's volume status is no longer a factor, and the Hep Gtt is being continued to evaluate for PE.
2. Sepsis and E. coli Bacteremia: The patient has E. coli bacteremia and UTI, which is being treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, and the fever curve is unreliable.
3. Afib with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with Metoprolol. Amiodarone can be used if the patient is unable to tolerate Metoprolol.
4. ARF: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is multifactorial, including sepsis, hypotension, and Acyclovir-related. CVVH is being held pending renal recs.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped overnight, possibly due to fluid collection. The patient is at risk for bleeding, and a low threshold for scan is recommended.
6. Myeloma: The patient is s/p SCT for multiple myeloma and is being treated with cyclosporine, valgancyclovir, and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil.
7. Ileus: The patient has return of bowel sounds but no stooling yet. The patient is on TPN.
8. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has difficulty controlling blood glucose due to infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; Nightly
   Cyclosporine dosing per BMT
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics
   (fenatnyl). No obstruction per KUB
   -On TPN
   - D/C fentanyl (for propofol)
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical history, including parainfluenza pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and possible pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, parainfluenza pneumonia, and possible PE, which is contributing to his respiratory failure. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory support plan in place.
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient is on meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least a 2-week course to treat his E. coli bacteremia and UTI.
* Afib with RVR: The patient is on metoprolol to control his heart rate, and amiodarone can be used if he is unable to tolerate metoprolol.
* ARF: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is multifactorial and related to sepsis, hypotension, and Acyclovir. He is on CVVH and fluid boluses as necessary to maintain blood pressure.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, and he is likely to improve with CVVH fluid shifts.
* Myeloma: The patient is post-SCT for multiple myeloma and is on immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and ursodiol.
* Ileus: The patient has ileus, which is exacerbated by narcotics and is being managed with TPN and discontinuation of fentanyl.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose is difficult to control due to infection, underlying diabetes, and steroids, and is being managed with a sliding scale of insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if his ARDS and parainfluenza pneumonia are not adequately managed.
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient's sepsis can worsen if his infection is not adequately treated, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Afib with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen if his heart rate is not adequately controlled, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
* ARF: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if his kidney function does not improve, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if his hematocrit does not improve, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma can relapse if his immunosuppressive therapy is not adequate, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Ileus: The patient's ileus can worsen if his gut motility does not improve, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes can worsen if his blood glucose is not adequately controlled, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.

The patient's care plan should include ongoing management of his respiratory failure, sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI, afib with RVR, ARF, anemia, myeloma, ileus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's family should be educated on his condition and the importance of adherence to his treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma on day 0. He is currently in the ICU with multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia, and mental status changes. The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, with wild fluctuations in blood pressure, and he is receiving multiple medications to control his heart rate and blood pressure.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and is on a propofol infusion to control his sedation.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with oliguric renal failure and a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. He is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is scheduled for a hemodialysis (HD) line today.

The patient's anemia is stable, with a hematocrit level of 20.7%. He is receiving transfusions for anemia and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

The patient's myeloma is being treated with cyclosporine, and he is receiving immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and nighty cyclosporine dosing.

The patient's ileus is ongoing, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His blood glucose levels are difficult to control due to his underlying diabetes mellitus, infection, and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has E. coli bacteremia, and he is at risk for further septic episodes.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further kidney injury.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but he is at risk for further bleeding.
5. Myeloma relapse: The patient's myeloma is being treated, but he is at risk for relapse.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, particularly with his compromised immune system.
7. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anemia and thrombocytopenia.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus is ongoing, and he is at risk for further gastrointestinal complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for evaluation of altered mental status,
   hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.
   Also with parainfuenza PNA; AFIB; concern for PE.  Overnight concerns
   over his mental status in that he appears agitated when sedation
   decreases but not alert.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE and
   continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE
   - switch sedation from Fentanyl/Midazolam to propofol to allow for more
   controlled weaning to assess mental status today
   - Continue CVVH
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Continuning on CVVH with fluid boluses as
   necessary to maintaine blood pressure.  Scheduled for HD line today.
   -dose all meds for GFR aprox 30 now that on CVVH.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid
   shifts
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <21
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine per level; goal around 200.
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil; Nightly
   Cyclosporine dosing per BMT
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics
   (fenatnyl). No obstruction per KUB
   -On TPN
   - D/C fentanyl (for propofol)
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma on day 0 (2165-3-8). He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of altered mental status, hypoxia, and meropenem desensitization for ESBL E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE, and continued volume overload requiring CVVH.
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after desensitization. The patient's hemodynamics vary wildly due to agitation, atrial fibrillation, and underlying infection.
* Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 15mg IV q4 to control his heart rate. Amiodarone can be used if he is unable to tolerate Metoprolol.
* ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension and Acyclovir-related. Continuing on CVVH with fluid boluses as necessary to maintain blood pressure.
* Anemia: Hematocrit stable. Hct improvement likely from CVVH fluid shifts.
* Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
* Ileus: Patient continues to have ileus, exacerbated by narcotics (fentanyl). No obstruction per KUB.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complex and multifactorial, and further deterioration can occur if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis and bacteremia: The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, and sepsis can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric renal failure is a concern, and AKI can further worsen if not properly managed.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen and lead to cardiac complications if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient's underlying infection can worsen and lead to sepsis and bacteremia if not properly managed.
6. Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels are difficult to control, and hyperglycemia can worsen if not properly managed.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus can worsen and lead to gastrointestinal complications if not properly managed.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension can worsen and lead to cardiovascular complications if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has a complex medical history, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and E. coli bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status is improving, with a decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in oxygen saturation.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with metoprolol. He is also hypertensive and has a history of hypertension.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, which is being monitored. He also has a history of multiple myeloma.
* Infectious status: The patient has E. coli bacteremia and UTI, and is receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.
* Nutritional status: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 10.9-12.2 K/uL, Hct 26.7-26.1%, Platelet count 258-146 K/uL
	+ Blood chemistry: Creatinine 1.8-3.3 mg/dL, Glucose 123-137 mg/dL
	+ Electrolytes: Na 137-134 mEq/L, K 3.3-3.4 mEq/L, Ca 7.7-7.7 mg/dL, Mg 1.9-1.9 mg/dL, PO4 3.4-3.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to increased oxygen requirements or the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, and his hypertension can exacerbate cardiovascular disease.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation.
* Infectious complications: The patient's E. coli bacteremia and UTI can lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's TPN may not provide adequate nutrition, leading to malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue CVVH and adjust as necessary
* Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for at least 2 weeks
* Monitor hemodynamics and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue TPN without lipids
* Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary
* Monitor CBC and adjust therapy as necessary
* Monitor electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 129.8 kg male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU with atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 127/57 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient has a central venous catheter, which was placed on the left internal jugular vein and is oozing from the site. The patient is receiving propofol infusion at a rate of 20 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and renal dysfunction. The patient's platelet count is low, and the coagulation profile is abnormal, suggesting bleeding risk.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient has a history of allergic reactions to penicillins, morphine, and dilaudid.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Bleeding complications due to the oozing from the central venous catheter site.
2. Infection due to the central venous catheter and the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Renal failure due to the patient's acute renal failure and underlying kidney disease.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation.
6. Neurological complications due to the patient's underlying multiple myeloma and potential bleeding risk.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions to prevent and manage potential complications."

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia and mental
   status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   status no longer a factor.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE- hold for
   Femoral line removal, HD line placement
   - Continue Propofol sedation.
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 5mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Holding CVVH today pending renal recs.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   - Switch to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop overnight possibly from fluid collection.  No
   evidence of bleed but low threshold for scan given his heparin gtt.
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <25
   - With Hct drop, CT scan for RP bleed or thigh hematoma
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine 25mg IV BID
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Return of bowel sounds today, no stooling yet.
   -On TPN
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status
   Improving overall with decreased FIO2 requirements and resolution of
   sepsis/stable hemodynamics off pressors.  Oxygenation has improved with
   volume removal. Primary barrier to extubation now is MS which is likely
   related to sedation.  No acute cns process on head CT. Is overbreathing
   vent while on ACV but has poorly tolerated PSW.  Continue to reattempt
   weans with lightening sedation. Will c/s pysch per BMT to inquire about
   discontinuation of prior PO psych meds contributing.  If little
   progress over next several days, would consider possibility of trach
   placement .  Remains on IV heparin for presumed PE.
   Suspect that decrease in hct may be related to volume shifts as trended
   down since CVVH on hold. Hct had bumped approp after transfusion on
   [**3-27**]. No evidence of active bleed but given heparin gtt RP bleed on
   ddx.   Follow serial h/h--if cont drop would check CT abd to r/o rp
   bleed and hold heparin.  Restart CVVH as per renal. To get tunnel line
   placement today.
   Continue Micafungin/Meropenem.  Vanco for CNS line infection. Now AF.
   Improved rate control on metoprolol IV and dig with improvement in
   labile BP. BMT recs in post BMT Rx, monitoring of cyclo levels daily
   and checking daily lfts.  Ileus
slowly improving since d/c narcotics as
   now with + BS and flatus.  Remains NPO on TPN--abd softer and now with
   BS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   multifactorial respiratory failure, E. coli bacteremia and mental
   status changes.
   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   status no longer a factor.
   - Continue Hep Gtt as we cannot evaluate further for PE- hold for
   Femoral line removal, HD line placement
   - Continue Propofol sedation.
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Currently on meropenem after
   densenitization.  The patient
s hemodynamics vary wildly as
   excacerbated by agitation, atrial fibrillation and underlying
   infection.  Cannot rely on his fever curve, but his WBC is stable.
   -Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin (d1= [**3-18**]) for at least
   2 week course to [**4-1**]
   -CIS, f/u blood / line cultures
 PORT Cx with gram + coag negatives,
   will continue vanco for 7 days post port removal (until [**4-2**])
   -f/u  ID recs
   # Afib with RVR: The patient is currently requiring Metoprolol 5mg IV
   q4 to control his heart rate.  Amiodarone can be used if he is unable
   to tolerate Metoprolol.
   # ARF: Oliguric renal failure. Multifactorial with Sepsis/hypotension
   and Acyclovir related.  Holding CVVH today pending renal recs.
   -continue to hold acyclovir
   - Switch to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop overnight possibly from fluid collection.  No
   evidence of bleed but low threshold for scan given his heparin gtt.
   -trend CBC
   -guiaic all stools
   -transfuse for <25
   - With Hct drop, CT scan for RP bleed or thigh hematoma
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p of SCT for multiple myeloma.
   -Dose cyclosporine 25mg IV BID
   -f/u BMT recs
   -holding acyclovir d/t probable acyclovir-related acute renal failure
   -nystatin for thrush prophylaxis
   -continue ursodiol per BMT protocol
   -continue immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil
   -avoiding steroids if possible d/t viral pneumonia
   # ileus: Return of bowel sounds today, no stooling yet.
   -On TPN
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection, underlying diabetes mellitus, and steroids.
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status
   Improving overall with decreased FIO2 requirements and resolution of
   sepsis/stable hemodynamics off pressors.  Oxygenation has improved with
   volume removal. Primary barrier to extubation now is MS which is likely
   related to sedation.  No acute cns process on head CT. Is overbreathing
   vent while on ACV but has poorly tolerated PSW.  Continue to reattempt
   weans with lightening sedation. Will c/s pysch per BMT to inquire about
   discontinuation of prior PO psych meds contributing.  If little
   progress over next several days, would consider possibility of trach
   placement .  Remains on IV heparin for presumed PE.
   Suspect that decrease in hct may be related to volume shifts as trended
   down since CVVH on hold. Hct had bumped approp after transfusion on
   [**3-27**]. No evidence of active bleed but given heparin gtt RP bleed on
   ddx.   Follow serial h/h--if cont drop would check CT abd to r/o rp
   bleed and hold heparin.  Restart CVVH as per renal. To get tunnel line
   placement today.
   Continue Micafungin/Meropenem.  Vanco for CNS line infection. Now AF.
   Improved rate control on metoprolol IV and dig with improvement in
   labile BP. BMT recs in post BMT Rx, monitoring of cyclo levels daily
   and checking daily lfts.  Ileus
slowly improving since d/c narcotics as
   now with + BS and flatus.  Remains NPO on TPN--abd softer and now with
   BS.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications. The patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, and possible PE. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute.
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and UTI: The patient is on meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin for a 2-week course.
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is on metoprolol IV to control his heart rate.
* Renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, which is multifactorial and possibly related to sepsis, hypotension, and acyclovir.
* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped overnight, possibly due to fluid collection. He is being monitored for bleeding and will receive a transfusion if his hematocrit falls below 25.
* Myeloma: The patient is s/p SCT for multiple myeloma and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
* Ileus: The patient's ileus is slowly improving, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, and he may require more aggressive ventilator support or even tracheostomy.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, and he may require more aggressive antibiotic therapy or even surgical intervention.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, and he may require more aggressive rate control measures or even cardioversion.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, and he may require more aggressive dialysis or even renal replacement therapy.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and he may require more aggressive transfusion therapy.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing additional infections, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding, particularly due to his low platelet count and his history of bleeding complications.
* Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias, particularly due to his history of atrial fibrillation and his current use of immunosuppressive therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple myeloma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis due to E. coli bacteremia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. His hemodynamic status is unstable, with tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, and his blood pressure is labile.

The patient has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and ursodiol. He is also receiving antibiotics for sepsis, including meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 23 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's radiology results show evidence of bilateral pulmonary edema, with asymmetric patchy opacities in the upper lungs, which may reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema and/or infection. His chest X-ray also shows a large cardiac silhouette and vascular engorgement.

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachycardia, irregular rhythm, and mild coarse breath sounds. He has 1+ pitting edema on his dorsum and upper extremities, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, and he may require continued antibiotic therapy to prevent further complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is severe, and he may require continued hemodialysis to manage his electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist, and he may require continued anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic complications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, and he may require continued monitoring for signs of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's radiology results show evidence of bilateral pulmonary edema and asymmetric patchy opacities in the upper lungs, which may reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema and/or infection. He may require continued antibiotic therapy to prevent further complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he may require continued insulin therapy to manage his hyperglycemia.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are low, and he may require continued calcium supplementation to prevent hypocalcemic complications.
9. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are elevated, and he may require continued phosphate binding therapy to prevent hyperphosphatemic complications.

In summary, this patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status to prevent further complications and promote recovery."

   # Respiratory failure: Complex etiology including ARDS , parainfluenza
   type 3 pneumonia, possible altered mental status, possible PE.  Volume
   overload is likely the biggest impediments to extubation currently.  He
   has been on empiric treatment for PE,  but heparin gtt has been off
   because of oozing from recent tunnelled catheter.  LENIs did not show
   DVT.
   - TTE tomorrow  to re-evaluate for RV strain to determine if long-term

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple myeloma.
* He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.
* He has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
* He is receiving empiric treatment for PE, but heparin infusion has been held due to oozing from a recent tunneled catheter.
* He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
* His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
* He has a central line infection and is receiving treatment with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient has a history of PE and is receiving empiric treatment. However, heparin infusion has been held due to oozing from the CVC, which increases the risk of PE.
2. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF):** The patient has ARF, which is multifactorial, including sepsis, hypotension, and acyclovir-related nephrotoxicity. He is receiving CVVH and will need to be monitored closely for further renal function deterioration.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management. He is receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled.
4. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of parainfluenza type 3 pneumonia, which may not be fully resolved.
5. **Catheter-Related Complications:** The patient has a CVC and a tunneled catheter, which increases the risk of catheter-related infections and complications.
6. **Fluid Overload:** The patient has fluid overload, which may worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of complications.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of ileus, which may lead to further gastrointestinal complications.
8. **Hematological Complications:** The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding and other hematological complications.
9. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including PE, ARF, sepsis, pneumonia, catheter-related complications, fluid overload, gastrointestinal complications, hematological complications, and cardiovascular complications. Close monitoring and prompt management of these complications are essential to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is fragile, and he may be at risk for further deterioration, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumothorax, or respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis and bacteremia: The patient's E. coli bacteremia may persist or worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may progress, leading to further fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to increased risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus may worsen due to the stress of his illness, leading to hyperglycemic crises or diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Infection: The patient may be at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections, or surgical site infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or retroperitoneal bleeding.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is tenuous, and he may be at risk for cardiac arrest due to his atrial fibrillation, hypotension, or other factors.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and mental status changes.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient remains intubated and sedated, with a SpO2 of 99%. The ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 650 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 30%.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has tachycardia and irregular heart rhythm, with a blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 10,678 mL of fluids, with a net balance of -7,910 mL.
* Renal function: The patient's urine output is improving, but the cause of acute renal failure (ARF) is multifactorial, including sepsis, hypotension, and Acyclovir-related toxicity.
* Blood counts: The patient's WBC count is 13.8 K/uL, Hct is 30.2%, and platelet count is 119 K/uL.
* Coagulation status: The patient has a prolonged PT/PTT/INR, indicating coagulopathy.
* Liver function: The patient has elevated ALT and AST levels, indicating liver dysfunction.
* Electrolytes: The patient has elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and decreased calcium and phosphorus levels.
* Imaging: The patient has a CXR showing a tunneled hemodialysis catheter in place, with a right lower lobe base cut off.
* Microbiology: The patient has E. coli bacteremia and UTI, but no growth in cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration or development of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has ongoing sepsis due to E. coli bacteremia and UTI, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ARF is multifactorial and may worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/PTT/INR indicates coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated ALT and AST levels indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance can lead to further complications, such as arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and cardiac arrest.
* Infection: The patient's ongoing infection can lead to further complications, such as septic shock, organ failure, and mortality.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
* Continue to manage the patient's ARF with CVVH and close monitoring of renal function.
* Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with anticoagulation therapy.
* Continue to manage the patient's liver dysfunction with close monitoring of liver function tests and potential liver transplantation.
* Continue to manage the patient's electrolyte imbalance with close monitoring of electrolyte levels and potential correction with electrolyte supplements.
* Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and sepsis, and adjust management accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), treated E. coli
   bacteremia and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation will be discussed today with his oncology team and
   family.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run even
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today: extubate if possible
   - Continue heparin gtt
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Continue Micafungin until Bglucan returns negative.
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal even
   today, adding fluid back as needed.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   BMT Recs: Cyclosporine, MMF
   # Diarrhea:  formerly Ileus, now stooling, on TPN.  Will send C. diff
   and add Flagyl ifpatient becomes unstable.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), treated E. coli
   bacteremia and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation will be discussed today with his oncology team and
   family.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run even
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today: extubate if possible
   - Continue heparin gtt
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Continue Micafungin until Bglucan returns negative.
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal even
   today, adding fluid back as needed.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID
   # Anemia: Hct Holding after [**3-30**] transfusion
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   BMT Recs: Cyclosporine, MMF
   # Diarrhea:  formerly Ileus, now stooling, on TPN.  Will send C. diff
   and add Flagyl ifpatient becomes unstable.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma on day 0 ([**2165-3-8**]). He developed respiratory failure, including ARDS, Paraflu, and possible PE, and was treated for E. coli bacteremia and mental status changes.

The patient remains intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy discussed as a means of bridging extubation. His respiratory failure is being managed with CVVH, and he will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today with the goal of extubation if possible.

The patient's sepsis and E. coli bacteremia/UTI have been treated with completed courses of meropenem and vancomycin, and he will continue to receive Micafungin until his B-glucan returns negative.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) has improved with Metoprolol and Digoxin. His acute kidney injury (ARF) is being managed with CVVH, and he will continue to receive fluids as needed.

The patient's anemia is being monitored, and he is being treated for diarrhea with TPN and Flagyl as needed. His type 2 diabetes mellitus is being managed with a sliding scale of Humalog and Lantus.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple myeloma, and he is currently on immunosuppressive therapy with Cyclosporine and MMF.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he may require further interventions to improve his oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis and E. coli bacteremia/UTI may recur, and he will require continued monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, and he will require continued treatment with anticoagulation and rate control medications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF may worsen, and he will require continued monitoring and treatment with CVVH and fluid management.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and he will require continued monitoring and treatment with blood transfusions and erythropoietin.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may persist or worsen, and he will require continued treatment with TPN and Flagyl as needed.
7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus may require further management with adjustments to his insulin regimen and monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

Overall, the patient requires continued close monitoring and treatment to manage his complex medical conditions and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Echo:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   probably normal (LVEF>55%). RV size is difficult to assess. The RV has
   borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-25**], no
   definite change.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), treated E. coli
   bacteremia and mental status changes.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation will be discussed today with his oncology team and
   family.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run slightly negative today given
   stabilization of blood pressures
   - Failed spontaneous breathing trial today: off all sedation patient
   became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic and tachycardic.
   Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board with plan.  IP evaluated
   patient
 unable to do because of patient
s anatomy and h/o prior
   trach; CT surgery to see patient in the AM for OR placement of trach
   - Continue heparin gtt for now, turn off prior to trach
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Continue Micafungin until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt
   spiking low grade fevers today, no antibiotics restarted.
   - Plan to remove right wrist A line.  L sided A line attempted today
   without success.  Re-attempt new Aline placement in the AM.
   - Consider removing L subclavian given erythema around insertion site.
   However, will need to establish central access prior to this (likely
   with additional PICC placement given that patient requires multiple
   ports for meds, TPN, etc.)
   - Re-checking CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on
   Acyclovir for awhile)
   # Afib with RVR:  Improved control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   # Psych: Psych not recommending starting anti-depressant urgently given

   - Low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4 prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses
   needed, consider Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up to 20mg/day as needed for
   agitation.
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal even
   today, adding fluid back as needed.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Switched to valgancyclovir per ID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   probably normal (LVEF>55%). RV size is difficult to assess. The RV has
   borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma on [**2165-3-8**]. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 110 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 145/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 126 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mEq/L
* Sodium (Na): 136 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 4.5 mEq/L
* Chloride (Cl): 100 mEq/L
* Carbon dioxide (CO2): 29.1%
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.3 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): No significant abnormalities.
* Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF > 55%). Right ventricular size is difficult to assess. There is borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Tachycardia
* Atrial fibrillation (AF)
* Hypertension
* Diabetes mellitus (DM), type 2
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Multiple myeloma
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Sepsis/E. coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and adjust fluid removal as needed.
* Continue heparin infusion.
* Perform spontaneous breathing trial and extubate if possible.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
* Continue valgancyclovir for CMV prophylaxis.
* Monitor for signs of ARF and adjust fluid management as necessary.
* Continue TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and adjust glucose control as necessary.
* Monitor for signs of DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Monitor for signs of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for dialysis
* Respiratory failure and need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation
* Cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias
* Infection and sepsis related to central lines and catheters
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke, due to sepsis and ARDS.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 129.8 kg male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including hypertension, type II diabetes, acute renal failure, multiple myeloma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 851 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.4 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 369 IU/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a normal left ventricular systolic function, with borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis of the right ventricle. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's microbiology results show that the stool culture was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) put him at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in his condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) can worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances and further complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension put him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Clostridium difficile infection and his current use of antibiotics put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's type II diabetes and his current use of insulin put him at risk for metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
7. Infection: The patient's multiple myeloma and his current use of immunosuppressive therapy put him at risk for infection, which can lead to further complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to his complex medical history and current condition. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Echo:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   probably normal (LVEF>55%). RV size is difficult to assess. The RV has
   borderline/mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-3-25**], no
   definite change.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who has undergone an allogenic stem cell transplant for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with a complex set of medical conditions, including:

1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE, and volume overload.
2. Sepsis and E. coli bacteremia, which has been treated with meropenem and vancomycin.
3. Acute renal failure, which is being managed with CVVH and valgancyclovir.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin.
5. Anemia, which is being managed with transfusions.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is being managed with insulin and TPN.
7. Diarrhea, which is being managed with TPN and possible addition of Flagyl if the patient becomes unstable.
8. Myeloma, which is being managed with cyclosporine and MMF.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially requiring intubation.
2. Sepsis and bacteremia, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Acute renal failure, which may worsen and potentially require dialysis.
4. Atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Anemia, which may worsen and potentially require further transfusions.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which may become more difficult to control and potentially lead to hyperglycemic emergencies.
7. Diarrhea, which may worsen and potentially lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Myeloma, which may relapse and potentially lead to further complications, such as bone marrow failure or infections.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and oncologists, is essential to ensure optimal care and outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with multiple myeloma who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) on day 0. He developed respiratory failure, bacteremia, and mental status changes. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Mixed etiology respiratory failure, including ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE, and volume overload.
* Cardiovascular status: Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.
* Renal status: Acute renal failure, with a flat urine output and large volume removal yesterday.
* Hematological status: Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL.
* Infectious status: Sepsis, E. coli bacteremia, and urinary tract infection.
* Neurological status: Intubated and sedated, with no spontaneous movement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: Continued respiratory failure can lead to further decline in lung function, increased risk of pneumonia, and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic state can worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress, leading to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to further cardiac complications, including stroke, heart failure, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of infections.
6. Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection can spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and increased risk of sepsis.
8. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes can worsen, leading to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CVVH and monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels.
2. Consider placing a tracheostomy to facilitate extubation and reduce the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Consider adding Flagyl to the patient's medication regimen if diarrhea worsens.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider cardioversion if the rhythm persists.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if the patient's acute renal failure worsens.
8. Consider adding a proton pump inhibitor to the patient's medication regimen to reduce the risk of stress ulceration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), s/p completed course
   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now pursuing
   tracheostomy.
   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, but
   oxygenation is much improved.  Failed spontaneous breathing trial : off
   all sedation patient became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic
   and tachycardic. Also displaying paradoxical breathing movts suggestive
   of diaphragmatic weakness.  Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board
   with plan.  Tracheostomy as a means of bridging extubation is planned
   as the patient failed SBT and has been intubated for a prolonged period
   of time.
   - As per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],  tracheostomy tomorrow at bedside with assistance
   from anesthesia
   - Continue heparin gtt for now for empiric Tx of PE as repeat echo
   confirmed RV strain.
   - Check NIF, continue MDIs
   - check benzo level to assess if still in system
   - decrease PSV to 8 from 10, keep peep at 8, currently over-ventilating
   # Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia and UTI: Completed course of meropenem and
   vancomycin.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be
   continued until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt spiking low grade fevers
   48 hours ago, none overnight.  No broad antibiotics restarted. Suspect
   low grade fevers related to multiple lines, including A line that
   appeared erythematous on the right.
   - A line removed and replaced.  Follow up tip culture.
   - Replaced left subclavian (not sent for Cx) with right IJ.  Patient
   requires multiple ports for meds, TPN, etc.
   - f/u CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on Acyclovir
   for awhile)
   - follow pending blood and urine Cx

   patient
s critical status.
   - Low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4 prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses
   needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Urine output flat.  Large volume removal yesterday.  Goal
   negative 1-2 L today.
   - Continue CVVH; D/W reanl re switch to HD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Respiratory failure:  The patient continues to have mixed etiology
   respiratory failure including ARDS, Paraflu 3 PNA, ? PE, Volume
   Overload (despite CVVH removal of ~10L).  Tracheostomy as a means of
   bridging extubation is planned as the patient failed SBT yesterday and
   has been intubated for a prolonged period of time.
   - Continue CVVH, paitent to run slightly negative given stabilization
   of blood pressures
   - Failed spontaneous breathing trial yesterday: off all sedation
   patient became hypertensive to 190/110
s, more tachypneic and
   tachycardic.  Plan to place tracheostomy, wife on board with plan.  IP
   evaluated patient
 unable to do because of patient
s difficult anatomy
   and h/o prior trach; Csurg to see patient for placement of trach
   tomorrow.
   - Continue heparin gtt for now for empiric Tx of PE as repeat echo

   vancomycin.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is to be
   continued until Bglucan returns negative.   Pt spiking low grade fevers
   yesterday, none overnight.  No broad antibiotics restarted. Suspect low
   grade fevers related to multiple lines, including A line that appeared
   erythematous on the right.
   - A line removed and replaced.  Follow up tip culture.
   - Replace left subclavian with right IJ.  Patient requires multiple
   ports for meds, TPN, etc.
   - f/u CMV VL per ID (as patient was off Valgancyclovir and on Acyclovir
   for awhile)
   - follow blood and urine Cx

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 100%
* CVP: 9 mmHg

The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a tracheostomy planned due to failed spontaneous breathing trials. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 123 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mmol/L
* Electrolytes: sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/L
* Liver function tests (LFTs): alanine transaminase (ALT) 14 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 29 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 121 U/L
* Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) 13.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 38.6 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.2

The patient has a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and sepsis. He is receiving mechanical ventilation, continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), and antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia and UTI. He is also receiving heparin for empiric treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of ARDS, need for further mechanical ventilation, or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis: progression to septic shock, multi-organ failure, or development of secondary infections
* Acute kidney injury: worsening of kidney function, need for renal replacement therapy, or development of acute kidney failure
* Coagulopathy: bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia or coagulation factor deficiency
* Hypoglycemia: blood glucose levels <70 mg/dL, potentially leading to neurological complications
* Hyperglycemia: blood glucose levels >300 mg/dL, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia
* Anemia: worsening of anemia, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications or increased risk of bleeding
* Diarrhea: worsening of diarrhea, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, or development of Clostridioides difficile infection

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids
* Glycemic control: sliding scale insulin with Lantus
* Lines: arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and dialysis catheter
* Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation with heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with subglottic suctioning

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is still uncertain."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and multiple myeloma. He has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 776 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 30%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 137 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 53 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 19 IU/L. His renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 23 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a right internal jugular catheter tip in the proximal superior vena cava, an endotracheal tube in the standard position, and a central left catheter in place. His chest x-ray shows mild cardiomegaly and clear lungs.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and intubation increase his risk of developing VAP.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and intubation make him susceptible to pneumonia, which could be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of pathogens.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and blood urea nitrogen level indicate acute kidney injury, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including sepsis, hypovolemia, and nephrotoxic medications.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
6. Wound infection: The patient's central line and arterial line increase his risk of developing wound infections, which could be caused by bacteria or fungi.
7. Bloodstream infection: The patient's central line and arterial line increase his risk of developing bloodstream infections, which could be caused by bacteria or fungi.
8. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's central line and arterial line increase his risk of developing catheter-related bloodstream infections, which could be caused by bacteria or fungi.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen and require more aggressive respiratory support, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
10. Organ dysfunction: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) could worsen and require more aggressive treatment, such as dialysis and vasopressors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and E. coli bacteremia. He is currently febrile, with positive beta-glucan and pending blood and urine cultures.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 108 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 126/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. He has a central venous catheter and an arterial line. He is receiving antibiotics, including Micafungin, and has a pending CMV viral load test.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 12.8 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 137 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* LDH: 587 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently febrile, which increases his risk of developing septic shock.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk of developing acute renal failure due to his underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
4. Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line, which increases his risk of developing catheter-related infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which increases his risk of developing hypertension-related complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, which increases his risk of developing hyperglycemia-related complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which increases his risk of developing anemia-related complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that he be closely monitored and managed in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple myeloma. He is febrile and has a positive beta-glucan, suggesting possible Candida infection. He is receiving antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is receiving medication to control it.

The patient has a significant amount of fluid in his lungs and is at risk for pulmonary edema. He is also at risk for bleeding due to his low platelet count.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.8, a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 137. His liver enzymes are elevated, and his kidney function is impaired.

The patient's medical history includes a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple myeloma. He has a history of respiratory failure and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's fluid overload and respiratory failure increase his risk for pulmonary edema.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and recent bleeding episodes increase his risk for bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan and history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection increase his risk for further infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase his risk for further respiratory complications.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury and need for dialysis increase his risk for further kidney complications.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases his risk for further cardiac complications.
7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and history of hyperglycemia increase his risk for further diabetic complications.
8. Multiple myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma and history of bone marrow suppression increase his risk for further bone marrow suppression and infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his dialysis therapy accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's diabetes mellitus type II and adjust his insulin therapy accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's multiple myeloma and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Febrile this AM post procedure and with positve beta-glucan.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - Consider risk/benefits of CTA repeat to evaluate for PE; will discuss
   with renal
   - CT lungs (with or without contrast) to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - back on trach collar as tolerated today
   # Fevers; previous Sepsis/ E. coli Bacteremia:  He continues to be
   febrile.  Completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Off all

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.

   ID any candididal mucosal infxn could cause this. Galactomannam
   pending.  CMV VL negative.  Another potential source of fever is R
   tunnelled HD line that looks erythematous and possibly infected.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and other complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place. He has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and paraflu, and is at risk for further respiratory complications.
* Fevers: The patient has a temperature of 101.1°F and has been febrile since the procedure. He has completed a course of antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection, and is currently receiving Micafungin due to a positive beta-glucan test. The source of the fever is unclear, and potential sources include a Candida mucosal infection, a tunneled hemodialysis line that looks erythematous and possibly infected, or another unknown source.
* Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib and is currently anticoagulated with heparin. His rate control is good with Metoprolol and Digoxin.
* Altered mental status: The patient is not waking up despite being off all sedation. He was seen by a psychiatrist and was not recommended for starting anti-depressants urgently given his current status.
* Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF possibly related to contrast initially. His urine output is effectively zero, and he is currently on hemodialysis (HD) with a tunneled dialysis catheter.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection, and is currently febrile. He is at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of AFib and is currently anticoagulated with heparin. He is at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest or stroke.
* Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and is at risk for further neurological complications, including seizures or coma.
* Infections: The patient has a history of infections, including E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection. He is at risk for developing further infections, including Candida mucosal infection or other unknown sources.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continue heparin gtt to prevent thrombosis
* Consider risk/benefits of CTA repeat to evaluate for PE
* Continue MDIs to manage respiratory failure
* Continue Micafungin to treat possible Candida mucosal infection
* Change HD line to prevent infection
* Consider vancomycin for possible line infection
* CT lungs and abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for possible abscess
* Continue LFTs and bili to monitor liver function
* Continue cyclosporin levels to monitor for myeloma recurrence
* Continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus to manage blood glucose

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a tracheostomy in place and mechanical ventilation on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He is febrile, with a temperature of 101.1°F, and has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with atrial fibrillation (AFib) controlled with metoprolol and digoxin. His renal function is impaired, with a urine output of effectively zero, and he requires hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, with a recent history of ileus and now stooling, and he is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His blood glucose levels are difficult to control due to his infection and require close monitoring.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and multiple myeloma, for which he underwent SCT. He also has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staphylococcus epidermidis line infection.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to his underlying lung injury and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive beta-glucan and fever may indicate a fungal infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's impaired renal function may worsen, requiring more frequent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and recent history of bacteremia and line infection may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's compromised nutritional status may lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, potentially exacerbating his underlying conditions.
7. Blood glucose control: The patient's blood glucose levels may continue to be difficult to control, leading to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's underlying cardiovascular instability and potential for cardiac arrest may lead to hemodynamic instability.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 61-year-old man, is a post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipient for multiple myeloma, with a history of respiratory failure (ARDS), Paraflu, possible PE, E. coli bacteremia, and staph epidermidis line infection. He has been mechanically ventilated and has undergone a tracheostomy.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm (with atrial fibrillation)
* Blood pressure: 120/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Weight: 110 kg (admitted weight: 132.3 kg)

Lab results:

* White blood cell count: 12.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 148 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 47 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 185 mg/dL

The patient has a positive beta-glucan, indicating possible candididal mucosal infection. He has been febrile since the morning and has been re-cultured.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive beta-glucan, indicating possible candididal mucosal infection. He has also been febrile since the morning and has been re-cultured.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's urine output is effectively zero, and he has undergone large-volume removal by continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.3 g/dL, indicating anemia.
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose level is 185 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may require further management.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue heparin gtt for empiric treatment of PE.
2. Continue MDIs.
3. Goal is PSV=5/PEEP=0 in the afternoon.
4. Monitor site of previous subclavian given surrounding blanching erythema.
5. Follow pending blood and urine cultures.
6. Continue micafungin and f/u galactomannan.
7. Start hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow.
8. Monitor LFTs and bilirubin daily.
9. Consider addition of Flagyl if diarrhea worsens and patient becomes unstable.
10. Continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed by FSG and adjust per TPN status."

   Now with fevers and  positve beta-glucan.
   # Fevers:   Previously he had  sepsis secondary to ESBL for which he
   completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Now he is febrile again

per ID any candididal mucosal infxn could
   cause this. Galactomannam pending.  CMV VL negative.  Another potential
   source of fever is R tunnelled HD line that looks erythematous and
   possibly infected.
   - change HD line
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now s/p tracheostomy.
   Now with fevers and  positve beta-glucan.
   # Fevers:   Previously he had  sepsis secondary to ESBL for which he
   completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Now he is febrile again
   for the past 2 days.  Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is
   being continued given positibe beta-glucan. Beta glucan now positive
   and of unclear significance
per ID any candididal mucosal infxn could
   cause this. Galactomannam pending.  CMV VL negative.  Another potential
   source of fever is R tunnelled HD line that looks erythematous and
   possibly infected.
   - change HD line
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection
   - CT lungs
   - CT abdomen/pelvis for ? abscess (though would prefer to avoid
   contrast given hx of contrast-induced ARF)
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   -  repeat blood cx
   - straight cath for UA/cx
   - continue micafungin

   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - Consider risk/benefits of CTA repeat to evaluate for PE; will discuss
   with renal
   - CT lungs (with or without contrast) to assess parenchyma

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, blood cultures, and antibiotic therapy. He has a history of sepsis secondary to ESBL bacteremia, which was treated with meropenem and vancomycin. He is currently febrile again, with a positive beta-glucan test, and is being treated with micafungin.

The patient's respiratory status has improved since the tracheostomy, and he is currently on a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. However, he still requires oxygen therapy and has a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg. He has a history of hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12/15. He is not following commands and has a positive Kernig's sign.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, consistent with acute kidney injury and possible sepsis.

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Heparin sodium infusion for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Metoprolol for control of hypertension
* Digoxin for control of atrial fibrillation
* Micafungin for treatment of fungal infection
* PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Vancomycin for possible line infection
* Lantus for control of blood glucose levels
* Humalog for sliding scale insulin therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's positive beta-glucan test and febrile state, there is a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury, which can lead to end-stage renal disease.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen his cardiovascular status and increase his risk of stroke.
* Infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan test and febrile state suggest that he may have an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Contrast-induced acute kidney injury: The patient's history of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and his current need for CT scans and other imaging studies increase his risk of developing contrast-induced acute kidney injury.
* Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's multiple lines and catheters increase his risk of developing catheter-related bloodstream infections, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 110 kg male admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, on mechanical ventilation, and receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiovascular medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula, tracheal mask, and CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan of the torso, show an ileopsoas abscess or hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's febrile response and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory support may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory needs, which could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's ileopsoas abscess or hematoma may be infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may increase the risk of bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, are slightly elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutrition and glycemic control may be compromised, which could lead to nutritional deficiencies and organ dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu, possible PE), s/p completed course
   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now s/p tracheostomy.
   Now with fevers and positve beta-glucan.
   # Fevers & Leukocytosis:   Previously he had  sepsis secondary to ESBL
   for which he completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Low grade
   fevers overnight. Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is being
   continued given positive beta-glucan. Beta glucan now positive and of
   unclear significance
per ID any candididal mucosal infxn could cause
   this. Galactomannam pending. Currently on a line holiday.
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - back on trach collar as tolerated today
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - anticoagulated with heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Head CT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output  effectively
   zero.  Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; mental status changes
   precluding weaning of mechanical ventilation, now s/p tracheostomy.
   Now with fevers and positve beta-glucan.
   # Fevers & Leukocytosis:   Previously he had  sepsis secondary to ESBL
   for which he completed course of meropenem and vancomycin.  Low grade
   fevers overnight. Off all antibiotics except Micafungin, which is being
   continued given positive beta-glucan. Beta glucan now positive and of
   unclear significance
per ID any candididal mucosal infxn could cause
   this. Galactomannam pending. Currently on a line holiday.
   - consider vancomycin for possible line infection
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy after failing multiple
   SBTs [**12-17**] hypertension, tachypneia, tachycardia.  Initial respiratory
   failure was secondary to ARDS (from ESBL bacterimia), Paraflu 3 PNA,
   possible PE. Currently  much improved.    He tolerated trach collar
   yesterday and was back on PSV overnight for rest.
   - Continue heparin gtt although repeat echo was without impressive
   evidence of strain
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - back on trach collar as tolerated today
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - anticoagulated with heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Head CT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output  effectively
   zero.  Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs
   - daily cyclosporin levels.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 61-year-old man, is in the ICU for multiple reasons, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, and acute kidney injury (AKI). He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma and has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection. He is currently on a line holiday and has fevers, which are being treated with Micafungin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg. He has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate and is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.5 x 10^9/L, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 148 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 29 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 10 IU/L. His creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 15 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show an ileopsoas abscess or hematoma, and his microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Fevers and leukocytosis: Continue Micafungin and consider vancomycin for possible line infection. Follow-up CT torso final read and pending culture data.
* Respiratory failure: Continue heparin gtt, follow-up CT lungs to assess parenchyma, and continue MDIs.
* Afib with RVR: Continue Metoprolol and Digoxin, and follow-up dig level.
* Altered mental status: Continue to monitor and follow-up with psych.
* ARF: Avoid IV contrast, restart HD/insert line per renal recs.
* Myeloma: Continue daily LFTs and bili, follow-up BMT recs, and daily cyclosporin levels.
* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed by FSG and adjust per TPN status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Candida infection: The patient has a positive beta-glucan test, which suggests the possibility of a Candida infection.
3. Line infection: The patient is on a line holiday, and the line may become infected, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which increases the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other respiratory complications.
5. AKI: The patient has AKI, which increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease and other kidney-related complications.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which increases the risk of thrombotic complications.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient has a history of infection-related complications, such as sepsis and ARDS, which increases the risk of developing other infection-related complications.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, which increases the risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
9. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, which increases the risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status.
   He has had low-grade temperatures overnight but a concerning 3 point
   Hct drop.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess:  The patient has a L sided collection in
   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  However, he has other possible causes
   for leukocytosis.
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   - Contact IR to consider draining abscess vs. hematoma
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest
  Still concerned for
   ARDS and ? PE.   Still not awake despite no sedation.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, considering MRI tomorrow if no improvement
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, possible pulmonary embolism (PE), and altered mental status. The patient has a tunnelled line that was pulled, and he is currently on line holiday. He has a left pelvic ileopsoas abscess or hematoma, which is being evaluated further.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg. He is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has a tracheostomy with a trach mask.

The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection, and he is currently receiving micafungin. He has a low-grade fever, and his white blood cell count is decreasing. However, he still has low-grade temperatures, and his hematocrit has dropped by 3 points.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with possible ARDS and PE. He is on pressure support ventilation and has occasional periods of pressure support ventilation. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is not awake despite being off all sedation.

The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and is currently on maintenance therapy. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is on a sliding scale of insulin with Lantus.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 x 10^9/L, hematocrit of 28.8%, and platelet count of 148 x 10^9/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, and his liver function tests (LFTs) show mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and line infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and he may develop ARDS, which could lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
3. PE: The patient's history of PE and the presence of a tunnelled line increase the risk of developing PE, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
4. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and decreased white blood cell count suggest that he may have an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Hematoma or abscess: The patient's left pelvic ileopsoas abscess or hematoma may rupture or become infected, leading to further complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest that he may have renal failure, which could lead to further complications and death.
7. Liver failure: The patient's mild elevation of LFTs suggests that he may have liver failure, which could lead to further complications and death.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of multiple myeloma and SCT may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Continue to provide oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to administer antibiotics and antifungal medications as prescribed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal and liver function.
6. Consider imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
7. Consider invasive procedures, such as drainage of the left pelvic ileopsoas abscess or hematoma, if necessary.
8. Consider cardiovascular medications, such as beta blockers or diuretics, to manage the patient's cardiovascular status.
9. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider neuropsychiatric evaluation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess: The patient has a L-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess. Given the patient's Hct drop, low-grade temperatures, and leukocytosis, it is likely a hematoma rather than an abscess. However, further evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of leukocytosis.

Potential complications:

* Infection and abscess formation if the collection is not properly drained
* Hemorrhage if the collection is not properly managed
* Organ failure if the patient's condition worsens

2. Low-grade fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent low-grade temperatures and leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

Potential complications:

* Sepsis and organ failure if the infection is not properly treated
* Leukopenia and neutropenia if the patient's condition worsens

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which may be due to ARDS, PE, or other underlying conditions.

Potential complications:

* Pneumonia and respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens
* Cardiac arrest if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates

4. Afib with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications.

Potential complications:

* Cardiac arrest and arrhythmias if the patient's condition worsens
* Stroke and embolic events if the patient's atrial fibrillation is not properly managed

5. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent altered mental status, which may be due to underlying infection, inflammation, or other conditions.

Potential complications:

* Seizures and status epilepticus if the patient's condition worsens
* Increased risk of falls and injury if the patient's mental status deteriorates

6. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to underlying conditions such as sepsis, ARDS, or other factors.

Potential complications:

* End-stage renal disease and dialysis dependence if the patient's condition worsens
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances if the patient's renal function deteriorates

7. Myeloma: The patient has multiple myeloma, which may increase the risk of complications such as infection, bleeding, and organ failure.

Potential complications:

* Infection and sepsis if the patient's immune system is compromised
* Bleeding and hemorrhage if the patient's platelet count is low
* Organ failure if the patient's condition worsens

8. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which may increase the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and nephropathy.

Potential complications:

* Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis if the patient's blood glucose levels are not properly managed
* Nephropathy and end-stage renal disease if the patient's diabetes is not properly managed

In summary, the patient is at risk for a variety of complications, including infection, bleeding, organ failure, and other conditions. It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and provide prompt treatment to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male, weighing 110 kg, who is admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, type II, and multiple myeloma. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antihypertensives.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/77 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 30%. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 6.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 138 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show new blurring of the left heart border on a chest X-ray and a hypodense lesion in the left iliacus muscle on a CT scan. The differential diagnosis for the lesion includes hematoma and abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration, particularly if the patient develops respiratory infections or if the mechanical ventilation settings need to be adjusted.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. This may require further evaluation and management, including dialysis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is stable, but there is a risk of sepsis, particularly if the patient develops a nosocomial infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient requires invasive procedures or if there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient's imaging studies show evidence of pneumonia and the patient's respiratory status is stable, which may indicate a risk of further infection.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutrition is being managed, but there is a risk of malnutrition and dehydration, particularly if the patient's calorie needs are not being met.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed."

   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and has been treated for E. coli bacteremia and staph epidermidis line infection. He is on tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.

The patient has developed a left-sided ileopsoas hematoma/abscess, which is suspected to be a hematoma rather than an abscess. The plan is to follow his hematocrit (Hct) and hold heparin, and re-address drainage issue if there is continued concern for abscess formation.

The patient has low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, which is being empirically treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to ARDS, Paraflu PNA, and possible PE. He is on tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin. His altered mental status is being managed with a trial of Head CT and consideration of MRI if there is no improvement.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is being managed with hemodialysis (HD) and line holiday. His type 2 diabetes mellitus is being managed with humalog sliding scale and Lantus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma expansion or bleeding from the ileopsoas hematoma/abscess.
2. Infection or abscess formation in the ileopsoas hematoma/abscess.
3. Progressive respiratory failure or ARDS.
4. Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Altered mental status or cognitive decline.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. Infection or sepsis from the E. coli bacteremia or staph epidermidis line infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's Hct and hold heparin to prevent further bleeding.
2. Re-address drainage issue if there is continued concern for abscess formation.
3. Continue empirical antibiotic therapy for low-grade fevers and leukocytosis.
4. Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of mental status change.
5. Continue tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and digoxin.
8. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider trial of Head CT and consideration of MRI if there is no improvement.
9. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with hemodialysis and line holiday.
10. Monitor the patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus and adjust treatment as necessary."

   and nodules of both lungs. Differential diagnoses include infectious
   and
   inflammatory conditions.
   3. Interval resolution of small bilateral pleural effusion.
   NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No edema, masses, mass effect, hemorrhage, or
   infarction is noted. Prominent CSF space in the left side of the
   posterior
   fossa iws most likely enlarged cisterna magna and less likely an
   arachnoid
   cyst. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with
   involutional changes. Small periventricular white matter hypodensities
   are
   compatible with chronic microvascular infarction. The patient is status
   post

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status.
   He has had low-grade temperatures overnight but a concerning 3 point
   Hct drop.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess:  The patient has a L sided collection in
   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  However, he has other possible causes
   for leukocytosis.
   - F/U CT Torso final read
   -  f/u pending culture data and galactomannan
   - continue micafungin
   - Contact IR to consider draining abscess vs. hematoma
   # Low grade fevers/ Leukocytosis: On 48 hour line holiday per BMT until
   tommorrow morning. [**Last Name (un) **] and swab of site have pending cultures. CT
   torso thigh and head have suggested no other source. Pt continues to be
   on micafungin given + glucan (non-specific) and pending galactomannam.
   VANCO/LEVO were started on [**4-7**] empirically.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest
  Still concerned for
   ARDS and ? PE.   Still not awake despite no sedation.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, considering MRI tomorrow if no improvement
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.  Off HD, phos has
   risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased. Will

   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy and tracheostomy mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation. There is concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a decreased hematocrit (Hct) and is on a line holiday, but will continue with hemodialysis (HD) in 48 hours.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is not awake despite being off all sedation, and there is concern for possible infection or other underlying causes.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient has good rate control with metoprolol and digoxin, but there is concern for possible systemic anticoagulation.
5. Multiple myeloma: The patient is status post SCT for multiple myeloma and is being monitored for possible relapse.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has difficulty controlling blood glucose levels in the setting of infection.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 12.5-16.4 K/uL, with a decreasing trend.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count (Plt) is 148-175 K/uL.
3. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): The patient's LDH level is 499 IU/L.
4. Elevated creatinine (Cr): The patient's Cr level is 1.4-6.6 mg/dL.
5. Elevated glucose: The patient's glucose level is 135-208 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show:

1. CT torso/LE: The patient has a new hypodense lesion in the left iliacus muscle, which may be a hematoma or abscess.
2. Non-contrast head CT: The patient has mild periventricular white matter hypodensities compatible with chronic microvascular infarction.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Further evaluation of the left iliacus muscle lesion, including pending culture data and galactomannan.
2. Continuation of micafungin and vancomycin/levofloxacin empirically.
3. Hold heparin drip given the enlarging thigh hematoma.
4. F/U CT lungs to assess parenchyma.
5. Continue tracheostomy and tracheostomy mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.
6. Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of mental status change.
7. Continue metoprolol and digoxin for rate control.
8. F/U Head CT and considering MRI tomorrow if no improvement.
9. Restart HD/insert line per renal recommendations in 48 hours.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hematoma or abscess in the left iliacus muscle.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Infection, including sepsis.
5. Relapse of multiple myeloma.
6. Hyperglycemia.
7. Acute kidney injury.
8. Altered mental status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   new L psoas hematoma.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess:  The patient has a L sided collection in
   his ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that
   his Hct has dropped, he is on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.  However, he has other possible causes for leukocytosis.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis, continuing Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Currently on line holiday but will continue with HD.  Off HD, phos has
   risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   - Will d/w nutrition re: concentration of TF
s to limit free water.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
 Original etiology
   =  ARDS (from ESBL sepsis), Paraflu PNA, and ? PE.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Altered mental status: Not really waking up despite being off all
   sedation.  He was seen by psych not recommending starting
   anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - F/U Head CT, consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing?
   - daily cyclosporin levels.
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has a history of respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. Currently, he is intubated and on a tracheostomy, with a persistent altered mental status and new left psoas hematoma.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ileopsoas Hematoma/Abscess: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is either a hematoma or abscess. Given the patient's Hct drop, heparin gtt for PE, and low-grade temperatures, it is likely a hematoma. However, the patient has other possible causes for leukocytosis.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, and his urine output is negligible. He is currently on a line holiday but will continue with hemodialysis (HD) in 48 hours. Phosphorus levels have risen, and the patient is experiencing progressive hyponatremia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his original etiology includes ARDS, Paraflu PNA, and possible PE. He is currently on a tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has good rate control with Metoprolol and Digoxin. However, his Digoxin level is supratherapeutic, and his heart rate is off Digoxin. No systemic anticoagulation is recommended.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has persistent altered mental status despite being off all sedation. He is being monitored, and a Head CT or MRI may be considered if his mental status does not improve.
6. Myeloma: The patient is post-SCT for multiple myeloma, and his myeloma is being monitored with daily LFTs and bili. He is also being followed up with BMT recs, including CELLCEPT dosing and cyclosporin levels.
7. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose is difficult to control in the setting of infection. He is being managed with a sliding scale of Humalog and Lantus, with adjustments made based on TPN status.

Overall, the patient has multiple complex medical conditions, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male, currently weighing 110 kg, who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm (82-105 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 159/70 mmHg (92-165/76-100 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (14-26 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving antibiotics, including levofloxacin and vancomycin. The patient is also receiving other medications, including metoprolol, and has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and Dilaudid-Hp.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.8-17.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7-9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 151-179 K/uL
* Creatinine: 5.3-7.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 119-123 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 136-140 mmol/L, potassium 3.6-4.5 mmol/L, chloride 95-105 mmol/L, bicarbonate 17-20 mmol/L
* Glucose: 119-190 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is:

* Total input: 1,373 mL
* Total output: 0 mL
* Urine output: not reported
* Stool output: not reported

The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nebulization and oxygen therapy, and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and antibiotic use may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for dialysis.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's acute anemia may be caused by ongoing bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and potential need for transfusion.
* Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and antibiotic use may indicate the presence of infection, which could lead to further complications and potential need for additional antibiotics.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that the healthcare team closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and fluid balance, and provide supportive care as needed to prevent complications and promote recovery."

 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Patient
s mental status improving marginally
   now several days off sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his
   eyes to voice, but does not yet follow commands.  Given his
   immunosuppression, he is more susceptible to CNS infections, however
   his slow improvement is staying our hand at further intervention at
   this time.  Largest concerns would be CNS infection or status
   epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by psych not recommending
   starting anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  The patient has a L sided collection in his
   ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his
   Hct has dropped, he was on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Electrolyte derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.
   Off HD, phos has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer
   increased.
   - Place HD Line
   - Restart HD once line in place
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Patient
s mental status improving marginally
   now several days off sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his
   eyes to voice, but does not yet follow commands.  Given his
   immunosuppression, he is more susceptible to CNS infections, however
   his slow improvement is staying our hand at further intervention at
   this time.  Largest concerns would be CNS infection or status
   epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by psych not recommending
   starting anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  The patient has a L sided collection in his
   ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his
   Hct has dropped, he was on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Electrolyte derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.
   Off HD, phos has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer
   increased.
   - Place HD Line
   - Restart HD once line in place
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute anemia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status.

The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical issues. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Central nervous system (CNS) infections: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, he is at risk for developing CNS infections such as meningitis or encephalitis.
2. Status epilepticus: The patient's altered mental status and history of seizures make him at risk for developing status epilepticus, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he is at risk for developing further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is ongoing, and he is at risk for developing further kidney damage or requiring dialysis.
5. Hematoma or abscess: The patient has a left-sided collection in his ileopsoas muscle that is either a hematoma or abscess. If it is an abscess, it may need to be drained, and if it is a hematoma, it may continue to bleed.
6. Infections: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central line and urinary catheter.
7. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of his hematoma or abscess.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte derangements are increasing, and he may require further management to correct these imbalances.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is ongoing, and he may require further management to correct this imbalance.
10. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are difficult to control, and he may require further management to prevent complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   respiratory failure (ARDS, Paraflu PNA, possible PE), s/p completed
   course for E. coli bacteremia and staph epi line infxn; currently on
   trach mask without sedation having persistent altered mental status and
   developing L psoas hematoma.
   # Altered mental status: Patient
s mental status improving marginally
   now several days off sedation (but also off HD).  He is now opening his
   eyes to voice, but does not yet follow commands.  Given his
   immunosuppression, he is more susceptible to CNS infections, however
   his slow improvement is staying our hand at further intervention at
   this time.  Largest concerns would be CNS infection or status
   epilepticus (non-convulsive). He was seen by psych not recommending
   starting anti-depressant urgently given patient
s current status.
   - Consider MRI  if no improvement
 will d/w BMT
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  The patient has a L sided collection in his
   ileopsoas muscle that is either hematoma or abscess.  Given that his
   Hct has dropped, he was on Heparin gtt for PE, his WBC is decreasing
   but still has low grade temperatures, he clinically appears to have
   hematoma rather than abscess.  Moreover, IR states that the progression
   is so suggestive of hematoma that it would be contraindicated to
   attempt to drain as this would cause further bleeding and possible
   seeding.
   -  follow Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   - Restarted Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis (7 day course), continuing
   Micafungin
   # ARF: Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   Electrolyte derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.
   Off HD, phos has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer
   increased.
   - avoid IV contrast
   - Restart HD/insert line per renal recs in 48 hours
   - Will d/w nutrition re: concentration of TF

   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support

   =  ARDS (from ESBL sepsis), Paraflu PNA, and ? PE.
   - Hold heparin gtt given above
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, anemia, and other complications. He has a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His mental status is altered, and he is opening his eyes to voice but does not follow commands. He has a left-sided psoas hematoma, which is being managed conservatively. He has acute renal failure, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are being managed with various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Infections: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and altered mental status, he is at risk for CNS infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient's altered mental status and slow improvement may indicate a risk for non-convulsive status epilepticus.
3. Ileopsoas Hematoma Abscess: Although the patient's hematoma is currently being managed conservatively, there is a risk of abscess formation, which could require drainage.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation may indicate a risk for ARDS.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte derangements may indicate a risk for AKI.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus and altered mental status may increase his risk for hypoglycemia.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and catheters may increase his risk for infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and psoas hematoma may indicate a risk for bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's mental status closely for signs of worsening or improvement.
2. Continue to manage the patient's ileopsoas hematoma conservatively, but be prepared to intervene if there are signs of abscess formation.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with hemodialysis and electrolyte management.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and consider weaning him off the ventilator when possible.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensive medications as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as needed.
8. Consider obtaining a head MRI or LP to assess the cause of the patient's altered mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, including ARDS, pneumonia, and possible PE. He has developed a left psoas hematoma and is experiencing altered mental status, which is improving marginally. He is also experiencing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is difficult to control due to infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CNS Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state, he is at risk for developing a CNS infection, which could worsen his mental status and potentially lead to seizures or status epilepticus.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient's altered mental status and slow improvement make him susceptible to non-convulsive status epilepticus, which could be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly.
3. Ileopsoas Hematoma Abscess: Although the patient's hematoma is currently thought to be non-infectious, there is a risk of abscess formation, which could lead to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and his dependence on tracheostomy and trach mask ventilation makes him at risk for respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's difficulty in controlling his blood glucose levels in the setting of infection increases his risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, and other complications.
6. Myeloma Progression: The patient's multiple myeloma may progress despite SCT, leading to potential complications, including bone marrow failure, anemia, and infections.
7. Anticoagulation-Related Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants, including heparin and warfarin, increases his risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and retroperitoneal bleeding.
8. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines, tracheostomy, and other invasive devices make him at risk for infection-related complications, including sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male who weighs 110 kg, with a history of multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute anemia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and altered nutrition. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/78 mmHg. He is receiving dialysis catheter support and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the presence of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of respiratory complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may exacerbate his respiratory failure and increase his risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows GPCs and GPRs 1+, indicating a possible infection. This may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding diathesis may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen his renal failure and increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. Multiple Myeloma: The patient's multiple myeloma may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of bleeding complications.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's altered nutrition may worsen his anemia and increase his risk of organ dysfunction.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma and has been in the ICU for a prolonged period due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He has a tracheostomy and is receiving oxygen therapy. His mental status has been altered, and he is agitated, but his mental status is improving marginally. He has a left psoas hematoma, which is likely a hematoma rather than an abscess. He is on hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure and has electrolyte derangements. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is difficult to control in the setting of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Central Nervous System (CNS) Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and altered mental status, there is a risk of CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
2. Status Epilepticus: The patient's altered mental status and possible seizure activity increase the risk of status epilepticus.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and acute renal failure increase the risk of developing sepsis.
5. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's left psoas hematoma and possible bleeding risk from the dialysis catheter increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
6. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing infection-related complications, such as catheter-related infections or line infections.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte derangements and HD therapy increase the risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia.
8. Wound Complications: The patient's tracheostomy and possible surgical procedures increase the risk of developing wound complications, such as wound infections or dehiscence.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and possible cardiovascular risk factors increase the risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure.  He is current extubated to trach, doing well and his
   mental status continues to improve.
   # Altered mental status: The patient
s mental status is improving with
   some agitation overnight resulting in mitts and ativan administration.
   He will now follow commands and open eyes to voice. Working theories of
   his alteration include uremia, sepsis, sedative medications, delirium
   of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has been stable
   s/p 2 units of blood yesterday.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to
   suggest an abscess or infected hematoma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin

   derangements increasing.  Patient due for HD line today.  Off HD, phos
   has risen and pt with progressive hyponatremia. Sevelamer increased.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   - Consider Head MRI or LP to assess cause of Mental status change
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin
   - f/u dig level: HOLDING AS SUPRATHERAPEUTIC: 2.5, will monitor HR off
   digoxin and restart as needed
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged period due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. He is currently extubated and has improved mental status, but still has some agitation. He is at risk for developing sepsis, uremia, and delirium. He has an ileopsoas hematoma, which is being monitored, and is on heparin for a possible pulmonary embolism. He has coagulopathy-negative staphylococcus wound infection and is on hemodialysis (HD). He has respiratory failure and is on tracheostomy and trach mask with occasional periods of pressure support vent rest. He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with metoprolol and digoxin. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is having difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. He is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and ileopsoas hematoma increase his risk for developing sepsis.
2. Uremia: The patient's acute renal failure and hemodialysis may lead to uremia, which can cause mental status changes and other complications.
3. Delirium: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple medical conditions increase his risk for developing delirium.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's ileopsoas hematoma and prolonged immobility increase his risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.
5. Wound Infection: The patient's coagulopathy-negative staphylococcus wound infection may lead to further complications, such as abscess formation and sepsis.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory arrest.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure and cardiac arrest.
8. Blood Glucose Control: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus and difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels may lead to further complications, such as hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's acute renal failure and hemodialysis may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia.
10. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple medical conditions increase his risk for developing infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for multiple myeloma. He has been in the ICU for an extended period due to respiratory failure, bacteremia, and acute renal failure. The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently extubated and using a tracheostomy with a trach mask, with occasional periods of pressure support ventilation. His respiratory status is stable.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being controlled with metoprolol and digoxin.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is improving, but he still has altered mental status, which is being monitored closely. He is at risk for worsening mental status, and an MRI or LP may be considered if necessary.
* Hematological: The patient has a coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus wound culture, which is being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin.
* Renal: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) and has a stable hematocrit after receiving two units of blood.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of bacteremia and is at risk for developing further infections.
* Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is difficult to control in the setting of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening mental status: The patient's altered mental status can worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and potential harm to himself or others.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, particularly given his history of bacteremia and presence of a central line.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiovascular complications such as stroke, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered mental status and use of sedative medications can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
6. Wound complications: The patient's coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus wound culture can lead to wound complications such as abscess formation or infection.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's coagulation status can worsen, leading to bleeding complications or thrombotic events.
8. Endocrine complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus can worsen, leading to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or hypoglycemia.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or address these complications."

 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure.  He is current extubated to trach, doing well and his
   mental status continues to improve.
   # Altered mental status: The patient
s mental status is improving with
   some agitation overnight resulting in mitts and ativan administration.
   He will now follow commands and open eyes to voice. Working theories of
   his alteration include uremia, sepsis, sedative medications, delirium
   of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has been stable
   s/p 2 units of blood yesterday.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to
   suggest an abscess or infected hematoma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Already started on Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving).
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.5)
   - Restart Dig 0.125mg every other day.
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure.  He is current extubated to trach, doing well and his
   mental status continues to improve.
   # Altered mental status: The patient
s mental status is improving with
   some agitation overnight resulting in mitts and ativan administration.
   He will now follow commands and open eyes to voice. Working theories of
   his alteration include uremia, sepsis, sedative medications, delirium
   of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has been stable
   s/p 2 units of blood yesterday.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to
   suggest an abscess or infected hematoma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Already started on Vanc/Levo for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving).
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast initially.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask with
   occasional periods of pressure support
vent rest.
  Doing quite well
   overnight. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as
   above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.5)
   - Restart Dig 0.125mg every other day.
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall, 113.1 kg male with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU with a tracheostomy in place and receiving respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.1, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 151. The patient's creatinine level is 7.0 mg/dL, and total bilirubin is 26.6%. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show no acute changes. The patient's microbiology results show growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus from a midline tip swab and Sputum culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include atrial fibrillation, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, multiple myeloma, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition via a nasogastric tube and glycemic control with insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient's microbiology results show growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus, which may indicate a potential infection. The patient's impaired skin integrity and presence of central lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia secondary to blood loss and impaired platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and impaired lung function may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Septic shock: The patient's potential infection and impaired immune function may increase the risk of septic shock.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and impaired cardiac function may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure.  He is current extubated to trach, doing well and his
   mental status continues to improve.
   # Altered mental status: The patient
s mental status is improving
   slowly, but etiology of AMS remains unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] will now follow
   commands and track. Working theories of his alteration include uremia,
   sepsis, sedative medications, delirium of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   - no indication for home psych meds at this time per psych, but they
   will re-eval him as mental stus improves
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided spontaneous ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has
   been stable for two days.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to suggest
   an abscess or infected hematoma.  There was a question of aspirating
   hematoma to ensure that it was not infected, but we believe that this
   is contra-indicated currently; if he develops increasing signs of
   infection or recurrent bacterimia, would re-address this as a source.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin, hold SQH per BMT
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Started on Vanc/Levo ON [**4-7**] for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving). Now off levo. Midline removed on [**4-8**].  Of note,
   pt had coag negative staff growing from port-a-cath which was removed 2
   weeks ago
he has not grown this on blood culture in the interim.
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course strting on date of
   line removal: 7 days from [**4-8**]
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast, acyclovir, initially; may have started with some
   damage from myeloma.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.  Getting UF
   between HD sessions.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask; not
   requiring pressure support
vent rest
 for several days.  Improving
   steadily. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask with 35% FIO2
   - despite prior concern for PE, no plan for heparin or CTA per BMT
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.3
 1.8)
   - Restarted Dig 0.125mg every other day on [**4-10**]
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance; current trough levels
   high
   - valganciclovir for CMV ppx
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 .H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   61 yo man s/p alogeneic SCT (day 0= [**2165-3-8**]) for multiple myeloma with
   prolonged ICU course for respiratory failure, bacteremia and acute
   renal failure.  He is current extubated to trach, doing well and his
   mental status continues to improve.
   # Altered mental status: The patient
s mental status is improving
   slowly, but etiology of AMS remains unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] will now follow
   commands and track. Working theories of his alteration include uremia,
   sepsis, sedative medications, delirium of the critically ill.
   - Continue to monitor his mental status, with signs of worsening,
   consider MRI/LP.
   - Per psych, in case he becomes agitated:  low dose Zyprexa 2.5mg Q4
   prn ok for agitation, but if higher doses needed, Haldol 2.5mg PO/IV up
   to 20mg/day as needed for agitation.
   - no indication for home psych meds at this time per psych, but they
   will re-eval him as mental stus improves
   # Ileopsoas Hematoma:  While on heparin for a possible PE, the patient
   developed a L-sided spontaneous ileopsoas hematoma.  His hematocrit has
   been stable for two days.  He has no fever or leukocytosis to suggest
   an abscess or infected hematoma.  There was a question of aspirating
   hematoma to ensure that it was not infected, but we believe that this
   is contra-indicated currently; if he develops increasing signs of
   infection or recurrent bacterimia, would re-address this as a source.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct, hold heparin, hold SQH per BMT
   - re-address drainage issue if continued concern for abcess formation,
   but no role at this time
   # Coag (-) Staph wound culture:  Patient
s midline tip culture positive
   for Coag (-) staph.  Started on Vanc/Levo ON [**4-7**] for leukocytosis
   (which is resolving). Now off levo. Midline removed on [**4-8**].  Of note,
   pt had coag negative staff growing from port-a-cath which was removed 2
   weeks ago
he has not grown this on blood culture in the interim.
   - Vancomycin HD protocol for 7 days total course strting on date of
   line removal: 7 days from [**4-8**]
   # ARF: On HD
   Possibly [**12-17**] contrast, acyclovir, initially; may have started with some
   damage from myeloma.  Urine output neglibile.
   - HD line in place, patient with every other day HD.  Getting UF
   between HD sessions.
   # Respiratory failure:  Now with tracheostomy and trach mask; not
   requiring pressure support
vent rest
 for several days.  Improving
   steadily. Barrier to trach removal is primarily mental status as above.
   - continue MDIs
   - Continue trach mask with 35% FIO2
   - despite prior concern for PE, no plan for heparin or CTA per BMT
   # Afib with RVR:  good rate control with Metoprolol & Digoxin (level
   1.3
 1.8)
   - Restarted Dig 0.125mg every other day on [**4-10**]
   - No systemic anticoagulation
   # Myeloma: Patient is s/p  SCT for multiple myeloma.
   - daily LFTs and bili
   - f/u BMT recs: CELLCEPT dosing
   - daily cyclosporin levels and dosing guidance; current trough levels
   high
   - valganciclovir for CMV ppx
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Difficult to control blood glucose in the
   setting of infection
   -continue humalog sliding scale with Lantus, followed FSG and adjust
   per TPN status

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the note mentions that he is currently on hemodialysis (HD). The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and his urine output is negligible. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular problems.
2. Infection: The patient has a Coag (-) Staph wound culture, which is a potential source of infection. The patient is currently on vancomycin and levo, and the note mentions that the patient's leukocytosis is resolving. However, the patient's blood culture has not grown this organism, and the patient's mental status remains unclear.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and his hemoglobin levels are low. This can lead to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, and his oxygen saturation levels are normal. However, the patient's respiratory status is improving steadily, and the patient is currently extubated to a tracheostomy with a trach mask.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and his heart rate is controlled with metoprolol and digoxin. However, the patient's heart rhythm is still abnormal, and the patient may be at risk for further complications such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Ileopsoas hematoma: The patient has a left-sided spontaneous ileopsoas hematoma, which is a potential source of infection. The patient's hematocrit has been stable for two days, but the patient's mental status remains unclear, and the patient's condition may worsen if the hematoma becomes infected.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy secondary to his myeloma, and the patient's platelet count is low. This can lead to further complications such as bleeding, bruising, and prolonged bleeding times.
8. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, and his blood glucose levels are difficult to control in the setting of infection. The patient is currently on a sliding scale with Lantus, followed by FSG and adjust per TPN status.

In summary, the patient's medical complications include renal failure, infection, anemia, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, ileopsoas hematoma, coagulopathy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's condition is complex, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications and improve the patient's overall outcome."
