   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma presenting with large-volume hematemesis. The patient has a nasopharyngeal mass that is suspicious for metastasis, which may be causing the bleeding. The patient has also been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating food, which may be related to dehydration. The patient has leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and tachycardia, which are being monitored and treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's nasopharyngeal mass may continue to bleed, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory distress, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
2. Dehydration: The patient's hyponatremia and difficulty tolerating food may indicate dehydration, which could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, seizures, or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or even death.
4. Metastasis: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications such as brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or even death.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastritis and hematemesis may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as perforation, abscess, or even death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's nasopharyngeal mass may cause respiratory distress, which could lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or even death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring and treating his bleeding, dehydration, infection, and other complications closely to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains stable, with a slight spike in temperature overnight, which was asymptomatic and cultured. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C) at 11:00 PM, which decreased to 98.3°F (36.8°C) at 07:03 AM. The patient's heart rate is 83 beats per minute, blood pressure is 140/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 17.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.1%
* Platelet count (Plt): 368 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL
* Other lab results, including liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation studies, are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of melanoma, and they are currently receiving ICU care for gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and elevated WBC count, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to further complications, such as hemorrhagic shock or malnutrition.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to their underlying cancer and treatment can increase their risk of developing infections.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase their risk of bleeding.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure their overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of melanoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature spike to 101.4°F (38.6°C) overnight, which is asymptomatic. The patient's blood cultures were taken at 11:00 PM.

The patient's physical examination is notable for pale appearance, weak appearing, and evidence of ulceration on EGD with no thrush. The patient's neuro examination is nonfocal, and their skin is without rash.

Lab results show:

* WBC: 17.7 K/uL
* Hct: 24.1%
* Plt: 368 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/25.5/1.3, ALT/AST: 31/39, Alk Phos/T Bili: 258/1.9, Differential-Neuts: 89.9%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 5.6%, Mono: 4.0%, Eos: 0.3%, Albumin: 2.8 g/dL, LDH: 2175 IU/L, Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is uncertain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever and blood cultures, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of melanoma and evidence of ulceration on EGD increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and chemotherapy increases the risk of infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support, including oxygen therapy, may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of melanoma and potential metastases may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate early renal damage.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's compromised nutritional status may increase the risk of deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Wound complications: The patient's skin ulcers may become infected or develop complications, such as cellulitis or abscesses.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - appreciate GI input and EGD, will review final report
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - ENT consult for nasopharyngeal mass - ?active bleeding
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - 2 unit pRBC's now, 2 additional crossmatched
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears later after ENT eval
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - NS 1L @ 175cc/hr
   - recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently travelling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is
   awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear
   when the next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was
   advised given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until ENT eval, then advance to clears as
   tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU until documented to be hemodynamically stable x 24
   hours

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - appreciate GI input and EGD, will review final report
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - ENT consult for nasopharyngeal mass - ?active bleeding
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - 2 unit pRBC's now, 2 additional crossmatched
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears later after ENT eval
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - NS 1L @ 175cc/hr
   - recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently travelling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is
   awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear
   when the next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was
   advised given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until ENT eval, then advance to clears as
   tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, presented to the ICU with large-volume hematemesis and was found to have a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the antrum of the stomach. The patient's nasopharyngeal mass has progressed, and a posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his epistaxis and hematemesis. The patient is currently receiving IV ppi, and an ENT consult has been requested to evaluate the nasopharyngeal mass. The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to prednisone therapy, and hyponatremia, which may be due to dehydration or prerenal azotemia. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which is resolving with IVF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and the source is unclear. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to prevent further bleeding and potential complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
2. Nasopharyngeal bleeding: The patient's nasopharyngeal mass has progressed, and a posterior nasopharyngeal bleed could be life-threatening. Close monitoring and potential treatment with blood products or surgical intervention may be necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, which could be related to his metastatic disease or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and potential treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.
4. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia may be due to dehydration or prerenal azotemia. Close monitoring and potential treatment with fluids and electrolyte replacement may be necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Tachycardia and cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia may be related to his underlying disease or other factors, and close monitoring and potential treatment with medications or other interventions may be necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma is progressing, and further evaluation and treatment with chemotherapy or other interventions may be necessary to manage his disease.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient's inability to tolerate PO may lead to nutritional compromise, which could exacerbate his underlying disease and increase the risk of complications. Close monitoring and potential treatment with nutritional support may be necessary."

   visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not surgical
   options. XRT started yesterday, plan for 10 treatments total. IR
   embolization yesterday without complication.
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis. GI input appreciated. ENT
   visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not surgical
   options. XRT started yesterday, plan for 10 treatments total. IR
   embolization yesterday without complication.
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed.
   - continue PPI (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor hct
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - ADAT
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Received 2L NS in ED, and 3 units pRBC's here, with
   continuation of IVF to maintain UOP. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr was also just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild
   prerenal azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia
 Possibly related to tumor, also following cultures as
   above. Appears to resolve some with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. advance diet as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges, plan to remove a-line prior to transfer to the
   [**Hospital Ward Name **].
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now, plan to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for XRT

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented with large-volume hematemesis. The patient has undergone radiation therapy, IR embolization, and has been receiving supportive care, including pain management and IV fluids.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm
* Blood pressure: 148/82 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemoglobin: 411 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 17.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 368 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Sodium: 21 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and mild prerenal azotemia. The patient's nasopharyngeal mass has progressed, and the source of bleeding is unclear. The patient has been treated with prednisone for suspected gastritis, and his gastritis has improved.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hematemesis: The patient has a large-volume hematemesis, which may be due to a posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma. If the patient rebleeds, a plan is in place to call anesthesia for an oral airway and then thoracics for a possible surgical airway if needed.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has recently started on prednisone for suspected gastritis, and his leukocytosis is being monitored.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has been struggling with nausea, vomiting, and difficulty tolerating PO, which may be due to dehydration. He has received 2L of normal saline and 3 units of packed red blood cells, and his IV fluids will be continued to maintain urine output.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to his tumor or infection, and he will be monitored on telemetry.
5. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility for the Plexikon clinical trial.

The patient's potential complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to his metastatic melanoma and the presence of a posterior nasopharyngeal mass.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for infection.
3. Dehydration: The patient has hyponatremia and may be dehydrated.
4. Prerenal azotemia: The patient has mild prerenal azotemia, which may be due to dehydration or another underlying condition.
5. Tumor progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results
2. Continuation of IV fluids and packed red blood cells as needed
3. Monitoring of his nasopharyngeal mass and bleeding
4. Evaluation for eligibility for the Plexikon clinical trial
5. Supportive care, including pain management and IV fluids
6. Advance diet as tolerated
7. Repletion of electrolytes as needed
8. Removal of the arterial line prior to transfer to the hospital ward
9. Transfer to the hospital ward for XRT"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of melanoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and tachycardia. The patient received radiation therapy today and has been experiencing fever, with a current temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 148/82 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving hydration, antibiotics, and pain management medications. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and hematoma.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Radiation toxicity: The patient's recent radiation therapy may cause radiation toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's anemia and elevated liver enzymes may indicate nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and elevated liver enzymes may indicate gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation, and abscess.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and pain management medications as needed.
3. Provide hydration and nutrition support to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.
4. Monitor for signs of bleeding complications, including bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, and take appropriate measures to control bleeding.
5. Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count, and take appropriate measures to treat infection.
6. Monitor for signs of radiation toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash, and take appropriate measures to manage symptoms.
7. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest, and take appropriate measures to manage symptoms.
8. Monitor for signs of respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure, and take appropriate measures to manage symptoms.
9. Monitor for signs of nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, and electrolyte imbalances, and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat deficiencies.
10. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation, and abscess, and take appropriate measures to manage symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of melanoma and recent radiation therapy. The patient has undergone embolization of the bilateral spheno-palantine branches of the internal maxillary artery and has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, with a recent bolus of 1.5L of fluid without improvement. The patient has a fever of 101.2°F and is receiving antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 148/82 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% and is not receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 368,000/μL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 52 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 31 IU/L. The patient's kidney function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes melanoma, and the patient is currently receiving radiation therapy. The patient's family history is unknown.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, potentially leading to hemorrhagic shock or other complications.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and mild anemia may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not properly treated.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient experiences further gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Radiation therapy complications: The patient's radiation therapy may cause further complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or skin irritation.
5. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may worsen if not properly treated, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's mildly elevated liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen if not properly treated.
7. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's normal kidney function may worsen if not properly treated, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo M with metastatic melanoma presenting with large volume
   hematemesis.
   .
   1. Hematemesis - unclear if source is GI vs. nasopharyngeal. EGD done
   upon arrival to MICU showed most evidence of blood in upper airway;
   that being said, there is a lesion suspicious for metastasis in the
   antrum of the stomach, however it does not appear to be the source of
   the bleed at this time. More concerning, however, is the marked
   progression of the nasopharyngeal mass seen on MRI head on [**4-29**]. A
   posterior nasopharyngeal bleed induced by melanoma could explain his
   large volume epistaxis and hematemesis.
   - GI input appreciated
   - ENT visualized two nasopharyngeal masses - ?active bleeding, not
   surgical options
   - rad onc consulted, plan for XRT if no rebleeding
   - if rebleed, plan is to call anesthesia for oral airway, then
   thoracics for possible surgical airway if needed. Then call
   interventional neuroradiology for embolization
   - continue IV ppi [**Hospital1 **] (evidence of gastritis)
   - continue 2 large bore IV's
   - maintain active type and screen
   - monitor Q6 hour hcts x 3
   - s/p 3 unit pRBC's
   - keep NPO for now, consider ADAT to clears
   - if hypotensive, consider adding stress dose steroids
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   2. Leukocytosis - recently started on prednisone 20mg daily on [**2181-4-20**]
   by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**]. No evidence of infection at this time, but will
   continue to monitor.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   3. Hyponatremia - patient has been struggling for months now with
   nausea, vomiting and difficulty tolerating PO. He could be very
   dehydrated. Already received 2L NS in ED, and will give pRBC's here,
   with continuation of IVF overnight. On last admission sodium was wnl.
   Cr is just slightly elevated, also raising suspicion for mild prerenal
   azotemia.
   - monitor
   - IVF, NS PRN
   .
   4. Tachycardia - resolving with IVF. Will monitor on tele.
   .
   5. Metastatic Melanoma - currently traveling to [**Location (un) 3327**] to see Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5606**] for evaluation for the Plexikon clinical trial. He is awaiting
   tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility. It is unclear when the
   next open slot will be and another cycle of chemotherapy was advised
   given his symptoms, which was initiated on [**2181-4-20**].
   - supportive care, pain regimen
   - further plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5607**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5604**] (they are aware of
   patient
s admission)
   .
   6. FEN - IVF and pRBC's. NPO until plan is finalized, then advance to
   clears as tolerated. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   7. Access - 2 18 gauges
   .
   8. Code - Full, confirmed with patient
   .
   9. ICU Care - iv ppi given evidence of gastritis, pneumoboots
   .
   10. Dispo - ICU for now

Summary:

The patient is a 27-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented to the ICU with large volume hematemesis. He has undergone radiation therapy and interventional radiology embolization. He is currently being treated for gastritis, and his hemodynamic status is stable. He has leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and tachycardia, which are being monitored. He is awaiting tumor tissue analysis to determine eligibility for a clinical trial and is receiving supportive care and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further bleeding, especially in the nasopharyngeal area.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
3. Dehydration: The patient's hyponatremia and vomiting may indicate dehydration, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's slightly elevated creatinine level may indicate mild prerenal azotemia, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's bleeding and potential respiratory compromise may require close monitoring and intervention to prevent respiratory failure.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastritis and bleeding may lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for malnutrition may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which need to be addressed promptly.
10. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase his risk of infections, which need to be monitored and treated promptly."
