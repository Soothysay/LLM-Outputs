You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a significant cardiac history, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation.

Current status:

* The patient is intubated and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation.
* He has a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.
* His oxygen saturation is 99%, and his ABG values are within normal limits.
* He has a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and a systolic murmur throughout the precordium.
* His abdomen is soft, with decreased bowel sounds and mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant (LLQ).
* He has a wound in the right lower extremity (RLE) with a clean dressing in place and 2+ edema.
* His neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being responsive to questioning.

Lab results:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.4
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 265
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.12 ng/mL
* TCO2: 31
* Glucose: 150 mg/dL
* Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

* Flash pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of VF arrest and is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac tamponade.
* Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure or impaired renal function.
* Urosepsis: The patient has a urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella, which may lead to urosepsis or septic shock.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may require thyroid replacement therapy.
* Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, which may require treatment.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab values.
* Titrate the nitroglycerin infusion to control blood pressure and prevent pulmonary edema.
* Continue diuresis as needed for volume overload.
* Consider extubation today.
* Continue antibiotic therapy for urosepsis.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardioversion if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's wound in the RLE.
* Monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider imaging if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism and hepatitis C."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple recent intubations due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, significant cardiac history including CABG, and VF arrest with AICD placement. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 65 bpm (48-94 bpm)
* BP: 88/46 mmHg (57-169/98 mmHg)
* RR: 12 inspirations per minute (12-21 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 99%

The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which is likely exacerbated by anxiety. The healthcare team plans to control triggers of anxiety and consider initiating long-term anxiolytic therapy.

The patient also has a history of systolic CHF (EF 20%) and has diuresed approximately 2.5 L this stay. The healthcare team plans to continue diuresis with lasix gtt.

The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella, and he is receiving meropenem therapy. He has a history of VF arrest with AICD removal due to recurrent infections.

The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and he has a history of CAD s/p CABG. The healthcare team plans to continue ASA and statin therapy.

The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he is receiving Coumadin at half dose. He has a history of DM2, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further episodes of flash pulmonary edema
* Development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulcer bleeding
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis due to his positive urine culture
* Wound infection due to his R leg ulcer
* Hypothyroidism
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalances
* QT interval prolongation due to anxiolytic therapy
* Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR

The healthcare team plans to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, and atrial fibrillation (AF) with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) removed due to bacteremia.
* He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times for episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation.
* Currently, he is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a recent episode of flash pulmonary edema that was controlled with nitroglycerin.
* His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
* He has a history of systolic heart failure (EF 20%) and is receiving diuretic therapy.
* His urine culture is positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella, and he is receiving meropenem for a 14-day course.
* He has a known coronary artery disease (CAD) with a patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery and diastolic dysfunction.
* His blood pressure is tolerating systolic blood pressures in the 80s, and he is receiving antihypertensive therapy.
* He has a right leg ulcer that was surgically debridement and is being treated with a wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device.
* His international normalized ratio (INR) is 3.6, and he is receiving warfarin for prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: Given his history of flash pulmonary edema and intubation, he is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: His positive urine culture and receipt of meropenem for a 14-day course suggest that he may be at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: His history of VF arrest and AF with an implanted AICD removed due to bacteremia suggest that he may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: His receipt of warfarin for prophylaxis and his history of bleeding complications may put him at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Wound infection: His right leg ulcer and receipt of wound VAC therapy may put him at risk for developing wound infection.
6. Hypothyroidism: His history of hypothyroidism and lack of thyroid replacement therapy may put him at risk for developing hypothyroidism.
7. Hyperlipidemia: His receipt of atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia may put him at risk for developing hyperlipidemia-related complications.

Based on this information, it appears that the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema, which is likely related to anxiety. He has a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage. He has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and is receiving meropenem for treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged intubation and presence of a central venous catheter.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has a PICC line, which increases his risk for developing a CRBSI.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest that he may be at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of systolic heart failure and coronary artery disease increases his risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and heart failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if he develops respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a central venous catheter increase his risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a central venous catheter increase his risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to identify any changes or complications.
2. Implement strategies to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of the bed and ensuring proper hand hygiene.
3. Monitor the patient's PICC line for signs of infection and consider removing it if necessary.
4. Continue to treat the patient's urinary tract infection with meropenem and monitor his response to treatment.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's cardiac medications to optimize his cardiac function and reduce his risk for cardiac complications.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubating him if he develops respiratory failure.
7. Consider consulting with a gastrointestinal specialist to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and develop a plan to prevent further bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a history of systolic CHF, CAD, and has undergone CABG. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial injury. His complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL and a platelet count of 265 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history includes a history of VF arrest, AICD removal, and recurrent infections. He has also had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory support increase his risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and his history of recurrent infections increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, systolic CHF, and elevated troponin-T levels increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's fluid overload and history of systolic CHF increase his risk of developing renal failure.
5. Wound infection: The patient's R leg ulcer and wound VAC placement increase his risk of developing wound infection.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of AICD removal increase his risk of bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's respiratory support as needed to prevent VAP.
3. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with meropenem and monitor his urine output.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to cover for potential cardiac complications.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his diuretic regimen as needed to prevent fluid overload and renal failure.
6. Monitor the patient's wound for signs of infection and adjust his wound care regimen as needed.
7. Consider restarting the patient's coumadin when his INR is within the therapeutic range.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac biomarkers and adjust his cardiac medication regimen as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99%, and his blood pressure is 88/46 mmHg. He has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which is likely the cause of his current respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. His liver enzymes are also elevated, with a significant increase in his alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and meropenem, which is being continued due to a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella. He is also receiving diuretics, including lasix and torsemide, to manage his fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to flash pulmonary edema, but other potential causes include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent cardiac biomarker elevations increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella increases his risk for sepsis and septic shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload is likely exacerbating his respiratory failure and may lead to further complications, such as acute kidney injury or cardiac failure.
5. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR increases his risk for bleeding complications, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may be contributing to his cardiac problems and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of hepatitis C may be contributing to his liver enzyme elevations and increasing his risk for liver-related complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with invasive ventilation and diuretics.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac biomarkers and consider further cardiac testing to rule out ACS or PE.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for the patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) and monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels to prevent further complications.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulant medications to reduce his risk for bleeding complications.
6. Consider re-evaluating the patient's thyroid status and considering thyroid replacement therapy if necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's hepatitis C status and potential treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of acute on chronic systolic heart failure. They have been on invasive ventilation since September 20, 2022, at 9:09 PM. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and impaired skin integrity. They have been receiving various medications, including fentanyl and midazolam, and have had several lab tests and imaging studies performed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg. Their respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 99% and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring is stable, with a cardiac output index of 2.3 L/min and a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and impaired skin integrity increase their risk of developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure and elevated troponin levels suggest a risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases their risk of developing pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and impaired gut function may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status closely. Additionally, the patient's family and healthcare providers should be informed of the patient's condition and potential complications to ensure proper care and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, receiving invasive ventilation and PICC line infusions. They have a history of antibiotic use, including meropenem, and are currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, with a respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute and an SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory cultures and antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent this complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent sepsis progression.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output, electrolytes, and creatinine levels is necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of bleeding signs and symptoms is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli suggest the possibility of delirium. Close monitoring of mental status and administration of sedatives and analgesics as needed is necessary to prevent delirium progression.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased sensation increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Close monitoring of skin integrity and regular turning and repositioning are necessary to prevent pressure ulcers.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheter placement. Close monitoring of lower extremity circulation and administration of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy are necessary to prevent DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a sore right foot. He has a history of chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. He has also been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and hepatitis C.

The patient has been experiencing flash pulmonary edema, which has required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has also had episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure, which has led to his current admission to the ICU.

The patient's current medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg/hour IV
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) 5000 units/hour IV
* Spironolactone 12.5 mg daily
* Isordil 10 mg tid
* Amytriptyline 25 mg qHS
* Meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 247 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.12 ng/mL
* CK-MB: 3.0 ng/mL
* Glucose: 120 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure
* Flash pulmonary edema
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Pulmonary embolism
* Constipation
* Hypokalemia
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatitis C
* Peripheral vascular disease

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function. The patient's medication regimen will be continued and adjusted as necessary to manage his condition.

The patient will be followed up with a cardiology teaching physician note and will be seen by a vascular surgeon for further evaluation and management of his peripheral vascular disease. The patient's wife will be updated on his condition and will be contacted for any changes in his status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, with this episode consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history and unchanged ECGs
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Flash pulmonary edema likely [**1-26**] anxiety,
   will attempt to control triggers of anxiety.
   - Nitro gtt, titrate to SBP<100
   - Titrate up bowel regimen
   - Will chart bx in regards to hx colonoscopy, consider consulting GI
   for scope if no records
   - Start amytriptyline today, will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 5mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   - Diuresis as needed for volume overload
   - Extubate today
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, will hold lasix gtt but continue
   -Diurese with lasix gtt
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
    - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent  bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].
   - Continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF schedule).
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today was 3.6.
   - Continue Coumadin at half dose as on meropenem (2mg PO daily is the
   new dose starting today).
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:- Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of multiple ICU and CCU admissions for hypoxic respiratory failure, flash pulmonary edema, and cardiac issues. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1,347 mL, and a total fluid balance of -973 mL.

The patient has a history of cardiac issues, including systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient's cardiac medications include aspirin, statin, ACE-I, and beta-blocker.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL Klebsiella, and is being treated with meropenem for a 14-day course. The patient's wound VAC has been placed, and the patient is being monitored for signs of infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient is still intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of cardiac issues, including systolic heart failure, and is at risk for cardiac complications.
3. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by ESBL Klebsiella, and is at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Infection: The patient's wound VAC has been placed, and the patient is at risk for developing infection.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, and is at risk for developing pulmonary edema.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued invasive ventilation to support the patient's respiratory status.
2. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, including cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram.
3. Treatment of the patient's UTI with meropenem for a 14-day course.
4. Monitoring of the patient's wound VAC for signs of infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**].  Most recent wound care rec is to not have a VAC in place
   (previously was: continue wound VAC with replacement 3x/wk (MWF
   schedule)).
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of right foot soreness. He has a history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He was recently extubated after experiencing flash pulmonary edema, which was likely related to his underlying heart failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and his respiratory status is being closely monitored. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella and is being treated with meropenem. The patient also has a right leg ulcer that was surgically debrided and is being treated with a wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and his current respiratory status, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and underlying cardiac disease increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest increases his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) increases his risk of developing another PE.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's history of heart failure and use of diuretics increases his risk of developing kidney injury.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and potassium-sparing medications increases his risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia.
7. Wound Infection: The patient's right leg ulcer increases his risk of developing a wound infection.
8. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of hepatitis C increases his risk of developing liver disease and liver failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving treatment for his UTI. The patient's right leg ulcer is being treated with a wound VAC system, and he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics to prevent wound infection. The patient's cardiac medications are being continued, and he is being monitored for signs of cardiac instability. The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and he is receiving treatment for his hypokalemia. The patient's wound care is being continued, and he is being monitored for signs of wound infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute on chronic, and has been experiencing flash pulmonary edema. He has been intubated multiple times during his previous hospitalizations. The patient's current condition is stable, but he continues to experience episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely related to flash pulmonary edema. He has also been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury, and anemia, which may be related to chronic heart failure. His coagulation profile shows a prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), which may be related to his history of bleeding complications.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a harsh systolic murmur auscultated throughout the left upper chest, with the loudest volume at the right upper sternal border (RUSB). His skin examination shows vascular insufficiency browning changes in his right leg, and his neurological examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and chronic systolic heart failure increases his risk of developing pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and his current cardiac status increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and history of bloodstream infections increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure.
4. Skin Breakdown: The patient's skin examination shows vascular insufficiency browning changes in his right leg, which may increase his risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current condition increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation and diarrhea.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current condition increase his risk of developing renal complications, such as acute kidney injury.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current condition increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but he continues to experience episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure. His treatment plan includes:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor his cardiac status closely and adjust his medications as necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics for his UTI and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Monitor his skin integrity and prevent skin breakdown.
5. Manage his gastrointestinal symptoms and prevent constipation and diarrhea.
6. Monitor his renal function and adjust his medications as necessary.
7. Monitor his respiratory status and adjust his medications as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal

   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 109.4 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He has been experiencing episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which has led to hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been intubated and is currently on a lasix drip to manage fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 76/38 to 116/57 mmHg, heart rate of 64-93 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His respiratory rate is 17 inspirations per minute, and his temperature is 36.4°C.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial damage. His creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 3.7 mmol/L. His white blood cell count is 8.0 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 274 x 10^9/L.

The patient has a history of urinary tract infections and has been prescribed meropenem for 14 days. He has also been prescribed spironolactone, furosemide, and isordil to manage his heart failure and fluid overload.

The patient's skin is showing signs of vascular insufficiency, with browning changes in his right leg. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and is currently on warfarin for prophylaxis.

The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with no signs of organomegaly or tenderness. His neurological examination is normal, with no signs of focal deficits or altered mental status.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Further episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which could lead to worsening hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Progression of his chronic kidney disease, which could lead to further electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
3. Development of a urinary tract infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Worsening of his skin changes, which could lead to further tissue damage and potential complications such as cellulitis or gangrene.
5. Development of a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which could lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent these potential complications and optimize his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].

   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU for management of acute on chronic systolic and diastolic CHF, hypoxic respiratory failure, renal impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values. The patient continues to receive various medications, including diuretics, anticoagulants, and antibiotics, and is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is characterized by repeated episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which may be exacerbated by anxiety, constipation, or other triggers. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CABG, and diastolic dysfunction, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and function is necessary to detect any changes.
3. Renal Impairment: The patient's renal function is impaired, which may increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, which may increase the risk of complications such as limb ischemia or gangrene. Close monitoring of peripheral circulation and wound care is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of bleeding risk and INR levels is essential to prevent further complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella, which may increase the risk of sepsis or other infection-related complications. Close monitoring of infection risk and antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if not managed effectively, which may increase the risk of complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation. Close monitoring of bowel function and constipation management is necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not managed effectively, which may increase the risk of complications such as cognitive impairment or cardiovascular disease. Close monitoring of thyroid function and replacement therapy is necessary to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize their clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypoxic respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU for multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation, and have a history of recurrent bloodstream infections leading to the removal of an AICD. The patient's current condition includes:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure with flash pulmonary edema
* Acute kidney injury with oliguria
* Chronic anemia
* R leg ulcer
* Known CAD with patent LIMA to LAD and diastolic dysfunction
* Supratherapeutic INR
* Positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella
* Constipation
* Hypokalemia

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 64 bpm
* Blood pressure: 90/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths/min
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.0
* Hct: 25.9%
* Plt: 317 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11 ng/mL
* TCO2: 31 mmHg
* Glucose: 296 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of recurrent bloodstream infections and the presence of a positive urine culture, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's current oliguria and elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing kidney injury, which may require further management.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD, patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction puts them at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of recurrent bloodstream infections increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and history of recurrent bloodstream infections suggest a high risk of developing further infections.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and history of flash pulmonary edema put them at risk for further respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and patent LIMA to LAD may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as ACS or PE.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed to manage their condition.
3. Consider further management of the patient's kidney function, including dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust their medication regimen as needed to manage their cardiac condition.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust their oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Consider further management of the patient's infections, including antibiotics and antifungals if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust their medication regimen as needed to manage their cardiovascular condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 109.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute systolic heart failure on chronic heart failure. He has a history of constipation, pain control, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity, and impaired gait. He is currently receiving furosemide (Lasix) infusion for heart failure, famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and meropenem for possible urinary tract infection (UTI). His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy at 2 L/min and has a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 317 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.11 ng/mL, and his lactate level is 32 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and elevated white blood cell count may increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's acute systolic heart failure and electrolyte imbalance may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic heart failure and acute exacerbation may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and potential sepsis may increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's risk factors for pneumonia, such as chronic heart failure and immunosuppression, may increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
7. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of wound infection.
8. DVT: The patient's risk factors for DVT, such as immobility and heart failure, may increase the risk of developing DVT.
9. VAP: The patient's risk factors for VAP, such as mechanical ventilation and impaired lung function, may increase the risk of developing VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 109.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute on chronic. He has been experiencing constipation, pain, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity, and urinary tract infection. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has a harsh systolic murmur and mild rales at the left posterior base. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, decreased hemoglobin, and increased white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and increased troponin levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute on chronic, and his current symptoms of hypotension and tachycardia may indicate worsening heart failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and death.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, which can cause abdominal distension, pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may spread to the kidneys, leading to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Skin integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity and his current symptoms of vascular insufficiency and browning changes in his right leg may indicate the presence of pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current symptoms of constipation and pain may indicate the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current symptoms of hypotension and tachycardia may indicate the presence of respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on these potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate treatment to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac arrest. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to flash pulmonary edema, and is being treated with diuretics and oxygen therapy. His blood pressure is currently running in the low 80s and high 70s, and he is tolerating this level of blood pressure.

The patient has a history of recurrent bloodstream infections, which has led to the removal of his automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). He is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin, CK, and CKMB, indicating cardiac damage. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, and a history of flash pulmonary edema. He has also been diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, and diuretics. He is also taking antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure makes him susceptible to developing pneumonia.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and his current condition make him at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and his history of recurrent bloodstream infections make him at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's history of systolic heart failure and his current condition make him at risk for developing renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and his current condition make him at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart Torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA ato 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   -monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start home Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 109.4 kg male with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac catheterization. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and fluid overload.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/44 mmHg (76/38 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a significant amount of fluid overload, with a net negative 1L fluid balance over the past 24 hours. He has been diuresed with Lasix and is currently euvolemic.

The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, and the current episode is likely related to this condition. Other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), although these are less likely given the patient's history and unchanged ECGs.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 8.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 274 x 10^9/L

* Spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrated to 25mg daily
* Lasix drip stopped, restarted with Torsemide
* Amytriptyline started for anxiety
* Isordil 10mg tid for pulmonary edema prevention
* Coumadin 5mg daily for atrial fibrillation
* Heparin drip for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pulmonary edema
* Fluid overload
* Hypotension
* Acute kidney injury
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection (UTI)
* Constipation
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatitis C

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue spironolactone and titrate to 25mg daily
* Restart Torsemide

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic venous stasis changes in his right leg. He has been experiencing flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation multiple times in the past. His current condition is stable, with a blood pressure running in the low 80s and high 70s, and he is complaining of right foot pain. He has a known allergy to penicillin and is currently taking various medications, including lasix, spironolactone, and amytriptyline.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0, a hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 274. His troponin level is 0.11 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 32 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL. His glucose level is 296 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 0.12 ng/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which can lead to hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation and is currently taking medications that can affect his cardiac rhythm.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Kidney damage: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for further kidney damage due to his medications and underlying condition.
5. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation and is at risk for developing bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Wound infection: The patient has a right leg ulcer and is at risk for developing a wound infection.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient is at risk for developing hyperkalemia due to his medications and underlying condition.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is at risk for developing hypothyroidism due to his medications and underlying condition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, and his medications are being adjusted to manage his symptoms. He is being monitored closely for any signs of deterioration, and his laboratory results are being closely monitored. The patient's wound is being cared for, and he is being treated for his UTI. The patient's cardiac status is being closely monitored, and he is being treated for his cardiac arrhythmias.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Stop lasix drip
   - Restart home dose of torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema, will plan to increase to 25 TID on [**9-24**].
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Decrease ASA to 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  Coumadin re-started yesterday, on Heparin drip.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft)
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   -continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - D/C Percocet
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Re-start Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  Repleted with small amt of K given lasix gtt and
   decline in K.  Expect to stabilize with discontinuation of lasix gtt
   and spironolactone.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 109.4 kg male with a history of cardiac disease, including systolic heart failure (EF 20%) and coronary artery disease with previous CABG. He has also had multiple admissions for flash pulmonary edema and is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* HR: 64 bpm
* BP: 90/44 mmHg
* RR: 17 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which is the most likely etiology of his current hypoxic respiratory failure. However, other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE), although these are less likely given his history and unchanged ECGs. The patient's supratherapeutic INR suggests that he may be at risk for bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.0 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 25.9%
* Plt: 317 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11 ng/mL
* TCO2: 31 mmHg
* Glucose: 296 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Lasix drip (stopped)
* Spironolactone 12.5mg daily (titrated to 25mg daily)
* Torsemide ( restarted)
* Amytriptyline (started)
* Isordil 10mg tid
* Coumadin 5mg daily
* ACE-I and BB
* Statin
* Meropenem (continued for 14 days)
* Heparin drip

The patient's plan includes:

* Goal: 1L out today
* Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the next day
* Stop lasix drip
* Restart home dose of torsemide
* Amytriptyline started, monitor QT interval
* Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary edema
* Continue Coumadin at home dose
* Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR
* Pulmonary edema due to continued fluid overload or hypertension
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or medication interactions
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and antibiotic use
* Constipation due to lack of bowel movement and medication use
* Anemia due to chronic disease and potential bleeding
* Wound infection or complications due to surgical debridement and wound care

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his medications and treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).
   - Goal: 1L out today
   - Start spironolactone 12.5mg daily
   - Continue lasix drip at 20mg/hour and titrate as needed to meet goal
   diuresis
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
   - Isordil 10mg tid with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent pulmonary
   edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours.
   -Continue to diurese with lasix gtt and start spironolactone today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ASA and statin
   - Continue ACE-I and BB
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen (feels constipated, although last BM was
   yesterday evening (large, soft))
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.
   - continue scheduled dressing changes.
   - Follow-up vascular recommendations today
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.7.
   - Resume coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Hypokalemia:
   - Not going to replete K as starting spironolocatone
   - Check 3pm electrolytes

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety (ie: constipation). Extubated yesterday
   successfully ([**9-21**]).

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

Summary:

* The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic venous stasis changes in the right leg.
* He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation, and is currently being treated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
* The patient is also being managed for fluid overload, and has had significant diuresis this stay.
* He has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella, and is being treated with meropenem.
* The patient has a history of VF arrest with AICD removal, and is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction.
* He has constipation and is being managed with a bowel regimen.
* The patient has a right leg ulcer and is being followed up with vascular recommendations.
* He is being treated for hypertension, and has a goal INR of 2.5-3.5.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure puts him at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome.
* Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and ongoing antibiotic treatment for UTI increases his risk of developing sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of VF arrest and AICD removal, as well as his current use of anticoagulant therapy, increases his risk of bleeding complications.
* Wound infection: The patient's right leg ulcer and ongoing wound care may increase his risk of developing wound infection.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and potential changes in his electrolyte levels may increase his risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VF arrest and current use of antiarrhythmic medications increases his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and potential use of anti-diarrheal medications may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, renal impairment, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. The patient's current condition is characterized by hypoxic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and systolic heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.9°F, blood pressure of 70/52-98/50 mmHg, heart rate of 68-72 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient has a PICC line in place, which was stopped on [**2178-9-23**] 02:53 PM. The patient has also had multiple infusions, including antibiotics, diuretics, and vasodilators.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 274. The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 32 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include spironolactone, torsemide, amitriptyline, isordil, and warfarin. The patient's anticoagulation status is subtherapeutic, and they are receiving heparin drips.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which can recur if the patient's fluid overload is not managed properly.
2. Systolic heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure can worsen if the patient's fluid overload is not managed properly.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's renal impairment can worsen if the patient's fluid overload is not managed properly.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease can worsen if the patient's fluid overload is not managed properly.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which can worsen if the patient's kidney function declines further.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if the patient's blood loss is not managed properly.
7. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation can worsen if the patient's bowel regimen is not managed properly.
9. Blood pressure control: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can worsen if the patient's antihypertensive regimen is not managed properly.
10. INR: The patient's INR is slightly elevated, which can worsen if the patient's anticoagulation status is not managed properly.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1 L out today
   - Increase spironolactone  to 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Increase Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic on
   exam.
   -Continue to diurese, with spironolcatone and torsemide, goal 1L out
   today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  INR 2.4 so continue coumadin, on Heparin drip until
   therapeutic.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip until INR therapeutic
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.4.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until therapeutic with coumadin
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to flash pulmonary edema, although other potential etiologies include acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
* The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
* The patient has been treated with diuretics, including spironolactone and torsemide, to manage fluid overload and systolic heart failure.
* The patient has also been treated with anticoagulants, including warfarin and heparin, to manage atrial fibrillation and prevent stroke.
* The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella, and is being treated with meropenem.
* The patient has a right leg ulcer that was surgically debrided and is now being treated with wound care and pain management.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, and is being treated with medications to manage these conditions.
* The patient's electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and magnesium, are being monitored and repleted as needed.
* The patient's nutrition is being managed with a heart-healthy and diabetic diet, and their glycemic control is being monitored with insulin glargine and sliding scale (SS) insulin.
* The patient's lines, including a peripheral intravenous (PIV) line and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, are being monitored and maintained.
* The patient is being prophylaxed for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with warfarin and heparin, and for stress ulcers with H2 blockers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued hypoxic respiratory failure, which could lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for intubation.
* Systolic and diastolic heart failure, which could lead to further fluid overload and potential need for diuretic therapy.
* UTI, which could lead to sepsis and potential need for antibiotics.
* Right leg ulcer, which could lead to further infection and potential need for surgical debridement.
* Hypertension, which could lead to further cardiovascular complications.
* Diabetes, which could lead to further metabolic complications.
* Hyperlipidemia, which could lead to further cardiovascular complications.
* Hypothyroidism, which could lead to further endocrine complications.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is likely that the patient will require continued close monitoring and management to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 1 L out today
   - Increase spironolactone  to 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Increase Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic on
   exam.
   -Continue to diurese, with spironolcatone and torsemide, goal 1L out
   today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  INR 2.4 so continue coumadin, on Heparin drip until
   therapeutic.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip until INR therapeutic
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia: stable, chronic.  Transfusion not indicated at this time.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**], now without wound vac in place.  No new vascular recs.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.4.
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin gtt until therapeutic with coumadin
   .
   # DM 2:  Continue glargine 120 u qHS, ISS with accuchecks.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions; this episode was consistent with prior episodes.
   Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely etiology of his
   hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies include ACS or
   PE, although these are less likely given his history, unchanged ECGs,
   and supratherapeutic INR.   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash
   pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to
   control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   - Goal: 500 mL out today
   - Continue spironolactone 12.5mg daily, titrate to 25mg daily in the
   next day
   - Continue torsemide
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Increase Isordil to 25mg TID with MAP goal >50 in attempt to prevent
   pulmonary edema
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, almost net negative 1L over past 24 hours, currently euvolemic.
   -Continue to diurese, with spironolcatone and torsemide, goal 500mL out
   today
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.  INR 2.4 so continue coumadin, on Heparin drip until
   therapeutic.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Coumadin at home dose
   - Continue Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 109 kg male with a history of systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. He has been treated with spironolactone, torsemide, and Isordil to manage his fluid overload and pulmonary edema. He has also been started on amitriptyline for anxiety and constipation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.0-5.5 K/uL
* Hct: 25.9-23.7%
* Plt: 274-317 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3-1.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11-0.12 ng/mL
* TCO2: 31-29 mmHg
* Glucose: 296-66 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 97.9°C
* BP: 70-106/52-63 mmHg
* HR: 68-78 bpm
* RR: 20-15 insp/min
* SpO2: 98%

Potential medical complications:

* Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and current treatment with diuretics and vasodilators make pulmonary edema a potential complication.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation make respiratory failure a potential complication.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation make cardiac arrest a potential complication.
* Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and current treatment with meropenem make infection a potential complication.
* Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and current treatment with laxatives make constipation a potential complication.
* Anemia: The patient's stable, chronic anemia and lack of transfusion make anemia a potential complication.
* Wound infection: The patient's R leg ulcer and current treatment with wound care make wound infection a potential complication.
* Hepatitis C: The patient's diagnosis of hepatitis C and deferral of treatment make hepatitis C a potential complication.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and current treatment with atorvastatin make hyperlipidemia a potential complication.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's diagnosis of hypothyroidism and lack of thyroid replacement therapy make hypothyroidism a potential complication.
* Hypokalemia: The patient's mild hypokalemia and current treatment with potassium supplements make hypokalemia a potential complication."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 2 L out today, as long as tolerated by BP
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Follow K [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete so on the order closer
   to/greater than 4.5 goal
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Hold Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed while diuresing
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   - Hope to extubated tomorrow morning after another 24 hours of strong
   diuresis
   - Prepare for Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, combined with diuresis.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue heparin drip; hold on re-starting coumadin (although INR
   therapeutic, hold on starting coumadin as prepare for Swan procedure
   Monday 10/5/9)
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u qhs
   today
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 2 L out today, as long as tolerated by BP
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Follow K [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete so on the order closer
   to/greater than 4.5 goal
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Hold Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed while diuresing
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   - Hope to extubated tomorrow morning after another 24 hours of strong
   diuresis
   - Prepare for Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, combined with diuresis.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue heparin drip; hold on re-starting coumadin (although INR
   therapeutic, hold on starting coumadin as prepare for Swan procedure
   Monday 10/5/9)
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u qhs
   today
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 2 L out today, as long as tolerated by BP
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Hold Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Can discontinue heparin drip now that INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.

Summary:

The patient is a 109.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of foot/leg pain. He has a history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema and is currently intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He is also experiencing fluid overload, constipation, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 59 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous pressure 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure 25 mmHg

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 272 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.9 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.12 ng/mL
* Electrolyte levels: potassium 4.1 mEq/L, magnesium 2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.4 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium 650 units/hour
* Furosemide (Lasix) 12 mg/hour
* Fentanyl
* Dextrose 50% 3.53 AM
* Other medications as listed

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is a major concern, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest or death.
2. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and current fluid overload increase the risk of further episodes, which could be life-threatening.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation could lead to bowel obstruction, which could be a life-threatening complication.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac failure or respiratory failure.
5. Wound infection: The patient's leg ulcer could become infected, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and immobility increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
7. Hepatitis C: The patient's hepatitis C infection could lead to further complications such as liver failure or cirrhosis.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could lead to further complications such as myxedema coma.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications from occurring."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor yesterday ([**9-24**]).
   - Goal: 1-2 L out today
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Continue torsemide
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, attempt to wean as appropriate
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%). Pt with significant diuresis this
   stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-poing
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source on exam
   - Check afternoon Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue coumadin at home dose, 5 mg daily
   - Can discontinue heparin drip now that INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 109 kg male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and recent cardiac catheterization. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, and has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 59 bpm, blood pressure 94/45 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) are not reported.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,094 mL of fluid and lost 2,630 mL of fluid, resulting in a net loss of 1,536 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 620 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 6.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 7.2 g/dL, platelet count is 272 x 10^9/L, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 34 mg/dL.
* Medications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including heparin, furosemide, lasix, and amitriptyline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella, which increases the risk of sepsis.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and current respiratory failure increases the risk of pulmonary edema.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's fluid overload and decreased renal function increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and recent surgical debridement increase the risk of infection.
* Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and current medications increase the risk of constipation.
* Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and recent Hct drop increase the risk of anemia.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are not reported, but the patient's history of cardiac disease and medications increase the risk of hyperkalemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following interventions should be considered:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's fluid status and electrolyte imbalances.
* Consider adjusting the patient's medications to minimize the risk of bleeding and infection.
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider adding nutritional supplements as needed.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and consider adjusting his medications to minimize the risk of constipation.
* Consider performing a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract.
* Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing blood products as needed.
* Monitor the patient's potassium levels and consider adjusting his medications to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.
   - Goal: 2 L out today, as long as tolerated by BP
   - Continue spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lasix drip (currently at 12 mg/hour, titrate as needed to diurese to
   goal)
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Hold Isordil to 20mg TID
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed while diuresing
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate possible extubation
   today
   - Prepare for Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Continue to diurese, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - ASA 81mg daily
   - Continue ACE-I and BB, statin
   .
   # Rhythmn:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has
   history of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream
   infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, combined with diuresis.
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~29.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 3.3
   - Continue heparin drip; hold on re-starting coumadin (although INR
   therapeutic, hold on starting coumadin as prepare for Swan procedure
   Monday 10/5/9)
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 u qhs
   had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u qhs
   yesterday.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant cardiac history, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. The patient has undergone recent extubation and is currently being monitored for potential complications.

The patient has a complex medical history, including:

* Chronic systolic heart failure (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction
* Coronary artery disease (CAD) with known 2-vessel disease
* Recent VF arrest with AICD removal due to recurrent bloodstream infections
* History of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation
* Chronic anemia with recent 4-point Hct drop
* Right leg ulcer with surgical debridement and wound VAC placement
* Diabetes mellitus type 2 with recent hypoglycemia episode
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hepatitis C with deferred treatment for now
* Hypothyroidism without current thyroid replacement therapy
* Nutritional concerns with OG feeding consultation

The patient is currently receiving treatment for:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure with intubation and ventilation
* Fluid overload with diuresis and Lasix boluses
* Coronary artery disease with ACE-I, BB, and statin therapy
* Rhythm disturbances with telemetry monitoring
* UTI with meropenem therapy
* Constipation with aggressive bowel regimen
* Anemia with Hct monitoring
* Right leg ulcer with wound care
* Blood pressure management with Captopril initiation
* Hyperlipidemia with Atorvastatin therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Flash pulmonary edema recurrence
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* UTI progression
* Constipation
* Anemia exacerbation
* Wound infection
* Blood pressure instability
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hepatitis C progression
* Hypothyroidism

Recommendations:

* Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results
* Adjust medications as needed to manage the patient's complex medical conditions
* Consider further diagnostic testing to rule out underlying causes of flash pulmonary edema and anemia
* Continue wound care and management of the right leg ulcer
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary
* Consider colonoscopy as an outpatient procedure to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal system
* Reassess the patient's nutritional needs and adjust OG feeding therapy accordingly
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Currently intubated after flashing again on the floor [**9-24**], awaiting
   potential extubation today.  Believe pt currently euvolemic, will
   attempt to maintain pre-load at current state and decrease afterload
   with up-titrating doses of Captopril.
   - Initiate Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Consider decreasing Isordil if needed for BP as afterload is reduced
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate, d/c Lasix drip
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Discontinue torsemide while on lasix
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Currently intubated and ventilated, anticipate extubation today
   - Anticipate Swan on Monday (10/5/9)
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:
   - Continue agressive bowel regimen
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with initiation of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop yesterday that then stabilized overnight. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Hct stable at ~22 following
   recent decrease in Hct, no evidence of bleeding.
   - Monitor Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.6.
   - Hold Coumadin as INR supratherapeutic, particularly in anticipation
   of Swan Monday [**2178-9-28**]
   - Continue heparin drip
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of cardiac issues, including CABG, VF arrest, and AICD placement.
* He has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation, and is currently extubated.
* The patient has fluid overload, likely exacerbating his known systolic CHF and diastolic dysfunction.
* He has an active urinary tract infection (UTI) with ESBL Klebsiella and is receiving treatment with Meropenem.
* The patient has chronic anemia, but his recent Hct drop is stable since.
* He has a right leg ulcer, which has undergone surgical debridement and wound VAC placement.
* The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to his diabetes and altered insulin dose.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Edema:** Given the patient's history of flash pulmonary edema, he is at risk for further episodes, especially with fluid overload and diastolic dysfunction.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiac history, including VF arrest and AICD placement, increases his risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. **UTI and Bacteremia:** The patient's active UTI with ESBL Klebsiella increases his risk for bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid overload exacerbates his systolic CHF and diastolic dysfunction, increasing his risk for further cardiac complications and pulmonary edema.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's chronic anemia increases his risk for complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. **Leg Ulcer:** The patient's right leg ulcer increases his risk for infection, wound dehiscence, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. **Hypoglycemia:** The patient's diabetes and altered insulin dose increase his risk for hypoglycemia, which can lead to severe complications, such as seizures, coma, and even death.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust diuretic therapy as necessary to prevent further fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm, and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
3. Continue treatment for the UTI with ESBL Klebsiella and monitor for signs of bacteremia or sepsis.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Continue wound care for the right leg ulcer and monitor for signs of infection or wound dehiscence.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male, weighing 109.4 kg, who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, which was stopped and he was extubated. He is currently receiving various medications, including carvedilol, heparin, and furosemide. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 86/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% on 40% FiO2. He has a first-degree atrioventricular block and a systolic murmur on the right upper sternal border.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 247 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.08 ng/mL, and his C-reactive protein is 29 mg/L.

The patient's medical conditions include pulmonary edema, constipation, heart failure, pain control, anxiety, impaired aerobic capacity, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired transfers, and urinary tract infection. He has a history of heart failure, systolic, acute on chronic, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged intubation and sedation may increase the risk of pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated lung injury: The patient's prolonged ventilation may lead to lung injury and fibrosis.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's heart failure may worsen due to inadequate treatment or underlying conditions.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, or fecal impaction.
5. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may spread to the kidneys, bladder, or other parts of the urinary tract.
6. Sepsis: The patient's underlying conditions and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of sepsis.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's prolonged immobility and underlying conditions may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and impaired nutritional status may increase the risk of malnutrition.
10. Delirium: The patient's impaired cognitive function and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of delirium."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.
   - Continue Captopril 6.25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   - Place swan today
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on [**9-24**] that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no obvious
   bleeding source found on exam.  Given that his hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that crit of 27.3 was likely a spurious
   result.
   - Continue to follow hct
   - f/u Retic count
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, will restart when INR is in therapeutic
   range
   - Continue heparin drip, will need to titrated down due to elevated PTT
   - f/u INR tonight at 7pm
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as necessary following extubation.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* The patient is extubated and comfortable.
* He has a systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with radiation throughout the precordium.
* His lungs are clear anteriorly.
* He has a right leg ulcer, which was debrided surgically and has a wound VAC in place.
* His electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, are within normal limits.
* His blood pressure is controlled, with a goal of less than 130 mmHg.
* His hemoglobin is 6.9 g/dL, and his platelet count is 247 K/uL.
* His creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, and his troponin-T is 0.08 ng/mL.
* His blood cultures are positive for ESBL Klebsiella.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of flash pulmonary edema, which can recur if not properly managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but he may need further adjustments to his antihypertensive regimen to achieve his goal of less than 130 mmHg.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to cardiac failure and exacerbate his flash pulmonary edema.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known CAD, which can increase his risk of cardiac events.
5. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella, which requires further treatment and monitoring.
6. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which can exacerbate his flash pulmonary edema and other medical conditions.
7. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Right Leg Ulcer: The patient has a right leg ulcer, which requires ongoing wound care and monitoring.
9. Hepatitis C: The patient has Hepatitis C, which may require further evaluation and treatment in the future.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's main focus at this time is controlling his blood pressure, managing his flash pulmonary edema, and treating his UTI. He will continue to receive antihypertensive medications, diuretics, and antibiotics as necessary. He will also continue to receive wound care for his right leg ulcer and ongoing treatment for his anemia and Hepatitis C.

The patient's code status is full, and he will continue to receive CCU care. His family will be kept informed of his progress, and he will be monitored closely for any changes in his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.
   - Continue Captopril 25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing and replete prn
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Goal SBP < 130 to prevent flash pulmonary edema; can tolerate lower
   SBP
s as needed
   .
   #  Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, yet had flash pulmonary edema again
   yesterday.
   -Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even, as above
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Condom catheter to monitor I/Os, UOP
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 130.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # Anemia
 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on [**9-24**] that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no obvious
   bleeding source found on exam.  Given that his hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that crit of 27.3 was likely a spurious
   result.
   - Continue to follow hct
   - f/u Retic count
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, will restart when INR is in therapeutic
   range, will recheck INR this evening
   - Continue heparin drip, will need to titrated down due to elevated PTT
   - f/u INR tonight at 7pm
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.
   .
   # Nutriton: Nutrition consult re: OG feeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   [**Male First Name (un) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema, requiring
   intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions. Although flash pulmonary edema is the most likely
   etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure, other potential etiologies
   include ACS or PE, although these are less likely given his history,
   unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment.   Perhaps anxiety
   provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if vice-versa is the
   case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and constipation.
   Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling BPs and PE
   triggers.
   - Continue Captopril 25mg daily and uptitrate as BP tolerates up to
   50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate

 patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on [**9-24**] that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no obvious

   Code status: Full (confirmed)
   Disposition: CCU care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a significant cardiac history, including CABG and VF arrest, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He was recently extubated and is currently comfortable. The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation, and has a history of cardiac arrest with AICD placement (removed due to bacteremia).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Extubated, with a SpO2 of 97% on 40% FiO2.
* Cardiovascular: Currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction, with a history of VF arrest and AICD removal.
* Hemodynamics: BP: 86/48 mmHg, HR: 66 bpm.
* Fluid balance: Total input: 2242 mL, total output: 3305 mL, with a negative balance of -1063 mL.
* Lab results:
	+ WBC: 5.3-5.6 x 10^9/L
	+ Hct: 22.7-23.4%
	+ Plt: 247-317 x 10^9/L
	+ Cr: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
	+ Troponin-T: 0.08 ng/mL
	+ TCO2: 29 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 51-160 mg/dL
* Medications:
	+ Captopril: 25mg tid for afterload reduction
	+ Lasix: 19mg/hour for diuresis
	+ Spironolactone: 25mg daily
	+ Amytriptyline: started for anxiety
	+ Heparin drip: for DVT prophylaxis
	+ Coumadin: held due to elevated INR
* Plans:
	+ Continue to monitor BP and PE triggers
	+ Uptitrate Captopril as BP tolerates up to 50mg tid for afterload reduction
	+ Convert Lasix to boluses to keep I/O even
	+ Continue Spironolactone and Amytriptyline
	+ Monitor QT interval and adjust Amytriptyline as needed
	+ Restart Coumadin when INR is in therapeutic range

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Flash pulmonary edema: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, and it is unclear if anxiety or other factors may provoke future episodes.
* Hypertension: The patient's BP is currently 86/48 mmHg, and the goal is to maintain a SBP < 130 mmHg.
* Diuresis: The patient has had significant diuresis this stay, and it is important to monitor I/Os and adjust Lasix boluses as needed.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of VF arrest and AICD removal, and it is important to monitor his cardiac rhythm and adjust medications as needed.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and it is important to monitor his blood sugars and adjust insulin doses as needed.
* Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, and it is important to monitor his bowel movements and adjust medications as needed.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic anemia, and it is important to monitor his Hct and adjust medications as needed.
* Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection in his right leg, and it is important to monitor his wound and adjust antibiotics as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   Code status: Full (confirmed)
   Disposition: CCU care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cardiac arrest, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) removal due to bacteremia.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. He is currently extubated and comfortable. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and multiple intubations suggest hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has had significant diuresis during his stay, and his current goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500cc/day.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has known coronary artery disease (CAD) and diastolic dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, with a recent 4-point hemoglobin (Hct) drop on admission, which has been stable since.
5. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation and has been started on an aggressive bowel regimen.
6. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella.
7. R leg ulcer: The patient has a chronic wound on his right leg, which was debrided surgically and is currently being treated with wound care and pain management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and the presence of cardiac dysfunction and fluid overload increase the risk of recurrent episodes.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture and history of bacteremia increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Wound infection: The patient's chronic wound on his right leg is at risk of infection, which could worsen his overall condition.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and the presence of cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of hypothyroidism exacerbation.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the presence of cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of hyperlipidemia exacerbation.
7. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and the presence of cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of anemia exacerbation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
2. Spironolactone 25mg daily
3. Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
4. Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
5. Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval
6. Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
7. Continue aggressive bowel regimen
8. Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
9. Monitor on telemetry
10. Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for afterload reduction
11. Continue Meropenem for 14 d course
12. Continue wound care per wound care recs.
13. Standing Tylenol
14. Oxycodone prn pain
15. Titrate up Glargine as needed
16. Continue Atorvastatin
17. Deferring treatment for Hep C for now, consider reassessment if patient continues to improve."

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] today and I concur with
   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.  Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a prolonged hospitalization
   complicated by recurrent requirements for intubation for flash
   pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes result from changes in
   the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, he has continued to diurese 1-2 L per day.  His
   capropril has been increased to 50 mg tid and he is tolerating this
   with BPs in the high 90s and low 100s.
   He remains symptomatically much improved
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

   on:[**2178-9-28**] 21:33 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including cardiac issues, flash pulmonary edema, and chronic anemia. He has been hospitalized multiple times for intubation due to recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema.

Current status:

* The patient is extubated and comfortable.
* His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/43 mmHg.
* He has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and diastolic dysfunction.
* He has been experiencing constipation, and his bowel regimen has been aggressive.
* His blood culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella, and he is receiving a 14-day course of meropenem.

Potential medical complications:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema is a significant concern, and he may require further intubation if his blood pressure becomes elevated.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient's systolic heart failure and diastolic dysfunction may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, if not adequately managed.
4. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and ongoing antibiotic therapy may lead to further infection or antibiotic resistance.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased wound healing.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac status closely.
* Maintain a high level of suspicion for flash pulmonary edema and take prompt action if his blood pressure becomes elevated.
* Continue aggressive bowel regimen to manage constipation.
* Monitor the patient's antibiotic therapy and adjust as necessary to prevent further infection.
* Consider further management of the patient's anemia, such as transfusion or iron supplementation.
* Continue to monitor the patient's wound care and adjust as necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate; on lasix gtt at
   10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain

   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. He has a significant cardiac history, including CABG, and has had a VF arrest with AICD removal due to recurrent bloodstream infections. The patient is currently extubated and comfortable, but has been experiencing constipation and has refused bowel meds. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure goal of <100 mmHg to prevent flash pulmonary edema. He is receiving diuretic therapy and has been started on captopril for afterload reduction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure may lead to further episodes of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history, including CABG and VF arrest, increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Constipation: The patient's refusal of bowel meds and history of constipation may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or sepsis.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella increases the risk of urinary tract infection and sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and recent Hct drop may lead to further anemia-related complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Wound Infection: The patient's R leg ulcer and wound VAC placement increase the risk of wound infection and sepsis.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of DM and recent hypoglycemia episode may lead to further hyperglycemia-related complications, such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or diabetic nephropathy.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and lack of thyroid replacement therapy may lead to further hypothyroidism-related complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased metabolic rate.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuretic therapy and monitor the patient's fluid status closely.
2. Consider converting the patient's Lasix drip to boluses to improve efficacy and reduce the risk of over-diuresis.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm, and adjust his anti-hypertensive regimen as needed.
4. Continue aggressive bowel regimen and consider colonoscopy as an outpatient procedure to rule out constipation-related complications.
5. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust his diuretic therapy as needed to prevent urinary tract infection and sepsis.
6. Consider transfusing the patient's blood products, such as platelets and red blood cells, as needed to prevent anemia-related complications.
7. Monitor the patient's wound status closely and consider wound care recs to prevent wound infection and sepsis.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust his insulin regimen as needed to prevent hyperglycemia-related complications.
9. Consider reassessing the patient's thyroid replacement therapy to prevent hypothyroidism-related complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate; on lasix gtt at
   10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 4.8.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - On Coumadin re-started yesterday, INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, titrate Lasix boluses as appropriate; on lasix gtt at
   10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)

   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry

   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction

   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed

   Disposition: CCU care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest, and a history of flash pulmonary edema. He was recently intubated due to an episode of flash pulmonary edema and is now extubated.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which may be related to hypoxic respiratory failure, anxiety, or other triggers.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload, likely exacerbating his known systolic heart failure (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known CAD s/p CABG and recent cath showed 2VD, patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction.
4. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of VF arrest and is currently in sinus rhythm with 1:1 conduction.
5. Blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is currently tolerating SBPs in the 80s, with a goal SBP < 100.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is positive for ESBL Klebsiella, and he is being treated with Meropenem for 14 days.
7. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation and is being treated with an aggressive bowel regimen.
8. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, with a recent 4-point Hct drop on admission that has been stable since.
9. Right leg ulcer: The patient has a s/p surgical debridement and wound VAC placement, with ongoing wound care.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR (4.8) and is being treated with Coumadin and heparin.
11. Diabetes: The patient is NPO, with a recent episode of hypoglycemia, and is being treated with Glargine and SS.
12. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated with Atorvastatin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further episodes of flash pulmonary edema
2. Fluid overload and worsening of heart failure
3. Rhythm disturbances, including VF arrest
4. UTI progression and sepsis
5. Constipation and bowel obstruction
6. Anemia worsening and potential bleeding
7. Wound infection and worsening of right leg ulcer
8. Coagulopathy and bleeding
9. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
10. Hyperlipidemia and potential cardiovascular events

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Controlling triggers of anxiety and constipation
2. Managing blood pressure and fluid overload
3. Continuing ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA, and Atorvastatin
4. Monitoring on telemetry and adjusting anti-hypertensive regimen as needed
5. Continuing Meropenem for 14 days for UTI
6. Aggressive bowel regimen for constipation
7. Monitoring and managing anemia
8. Continuing wound care for right leg ulcer
9. Re-starting Coumadin and adjusting INR as needed
10. Monitoring and managing diabetes
11. Continuing Atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia

The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and his wife has been contacted for updates. The patient's code status is full, and he is being cared for in the CCU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall, 111.5 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute onset of shortness of breath. He has a history of chronic heart failure, and his current condition is acute on chronic. He is currently receiving treatment for pulmonary edema, constipation, and heart failure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/46 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 216 K/uL. His creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his troponin level is 0.08 ng/mL. His electrocardiogram shows a first-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired muscle performance, pulmonary edema, and constipation. He has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently experiencing acute heart failure. He is also experiencing pain, anxiety, and impaired aerobic capacity and endurance.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current acute heart failure increase his risk of cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory failure increase his risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and history of chronic heart failure increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, and malnutrition.
4. Infection: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current acute heart failure increase his risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infections.
5. Skin integrity: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current acute heart failure increase his risk of skin integrity complications such as pressure ulcers, skin breakdown, and wound infection.
6. Hypotension: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current acute heart failure increase his risk of hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and current acute heart failure increase his risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including cardiac issues, chronic anemia, and recent episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has undergone various treatments, including intubation, diuresis, and antibiotics.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 58 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 83/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Alert and oriented x3, extubated, and nods head to questions appropriately
* Right radial pulse (RR) present, with a III/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border (RUSB) with radiation throughout the precordium
* Minimal rales at the bases of both lungs, otherwise clear
* Soft, non-tender (NT), non-distended (ND), and + bowel sounds (BS) in the abdomen
* 2+ edema in the right leg, with a right foot bandage and an amputated left leg

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 8.2 K/uL
* Platelet count (Plt): 73 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 3.7 mg/dL

The patient has a history of cardiac issues, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and has recently had episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He is currently being treated for hypoxic respiratory failure, and his main focus is controlling his blood pressure and preventing flash pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to his history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and atrioventricular (AV) block
* Respiratory failure due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and flash pulmonary edema
* Renal failure due to his chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diuretic therapy
* Infection due to his recent episode of bacteremia and ongoing antibiotic therapy
* Anemia due to his chronic anemia and potential bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract
* Constipation due to his recent episode of constipation and ongoing bowel regimen
* Hyperglycemia due to his diabetes mellitus (DM) and potential insulin resistance
* Hypothyroidism due to his history of hypothyroidism and potential thyroid hormone replacement therapy

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, continue Lasix gtt at 10mg/hr
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -Currently on Lasix drip with -1L/day, consider converting to Lasix to
   boluses
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, with uptitration of Captopril for
   afterload reduction
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high at 2.3.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, Heparin
   d/c
ed recently.
   - INR therapeutic
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including cardiac issues, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He has been intubated and extubated, and is currently comfortable. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and a heart rate of 58 bpm. His respiratory support is minimal, with oxygen delivery via a non-rebreather mask. He has a history of cardiac arrest and has undergone cardiac catheterization.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure puts him at risk for further episodes.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and coronary artery disease puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and his history of bacteremia put him at risk for further infections.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and recent Hct drop put him at risk for further anemia-related complications.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and recent bowel regimen put him at risk for further constipation-related complications.
6. Wound complications: The patient's R leg ulcer and recent surgical debridement put him at risk for further wound complications.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and recent bleeding put him at risk for further bleeding complications.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and recent hypoglycemia put him at risk for further hyperglycemia-related complications.
9. Liver disease: The patient's history of Hepatitis C and recent deferral of treatment put him at risk for further liver-related complications.
10. Thyroid issues: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent lack of thyroid replacement therapy put him at risk for further thyroid-related complications.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's goal is to control his blood pressure, prevent flash pulmonary edema, and manage his cardiac and respiratory issues. He will continue to receive Lasix, Captopril, and Spironolactone to control his blood pressure and fluid overload. He will also continue to receive Meropenem for his UTI and Atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. His wound care will continue as planned, and he will be monitored for signs of infection and bleeding."

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued, but he has had
   hypotension with a systolic BP ranging between 60-80 systolic for most
   of the day.  Although his is asymptomatic, we will lower his captopril
   to 37.5 mg tid to allow him a slightly higher systolic BP.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes
   of flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4969**], hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of
   bacteremia).  Pt recently had another episode of flash pulm edema,
   requiring intubation, now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Continue Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - Goal I/O even, will hold lasix gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, currently appears euvolemic with goal
   to keep (-)500cc/day.
   -diuril boluses to maintain Is and Os at goal
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed.  No CP o/n, previous episodes of CP did not seem to be
   cardiac in origin.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above, will likely continue captopril as
   outpatient
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue agressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit.
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   .
   # [**Month/Year (2) 4969**]: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5. INR today is 2.6.  On Coumadin, at half home
   dose
   - increase coumadin dose to home dose of  5mg
   -restart heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # DM 2:  Patient NPO, so Glargine dose halved from 120 to 60 units qhs
 had episode of hypoglycemia o/n, so decrease glargine again to 40 u
   qhs recently.  Sugars in good range since recent change in insulin
   dose.
   - Titrate up Glargine as needed
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate.

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6984**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued, but he has had
   hypotension with a systolic BP ranging between 60-80 systolic for most
   of the day.  Although his is asymptomatic, we will lower his captopril
   to 37.5 mg tid to allow him a slightly higher systolic BP.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 5899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8906**], MD
   on:[**2178-9-29**] 19:50 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which has required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated with diuretics and antihypertensive medications to control his blood pressure and prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Blood pressure 83/46 mmHg, heart rate 58 beats per minute, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Physical examination: The patient is alert and oriented, with a gentle systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border with radiation throughout the precordium. His lungs are clear anteriorly, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 7.0 g/dL, and platelet count is 264 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his troponin-T level is 0.08 ng/mL.
* Medications: The patient is receiving captopril 50 mg tid, spironolactone 25 mg daily, diuril boluses as needed, and ativan prn for anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently 83/46 mmHg, which is below the normal range. This could lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, which indicates that he is not experiencing significant respiratory distress at this time. However, his history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure suggests that he may be at risk for further respiratory complications.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VF arrest and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella suggests that he may be at risk for further infections.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Wound complications: The patient's right leg ulcer is at risk for further complications, including infection and dehiscence.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that he be closely monitored and treated with diuretics and antihypertensive medications to control his blood pressure and prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema. The patient should also be monitored for signs of hypotension, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and wound complications."

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. He was recently extubated and is currently extubated and comfortable. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to his cardiac history and recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. His current condition is characterized by hypertension, fluid overload, and chronic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 80s, and the goal is to keep it below 100 to prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema. If not controlled, hypertension can lead to cardiac complications, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has had significant diuresis this stay, but is still at risk for fluid overload due to his cardiac history and ongoing fluid administration. Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. If not managed properly, anemia can exacerbate cardiac disease and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
4. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and peritonitis if not managed properly.
6. Wound Infection: The patient has a surgical wound on his right leg, which is at risk for infection and delayed healing if not managed properly.
7. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for thrombosis due to his cardiac history and immobility. If not managed properly, thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular events.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and managing his hypertension, fluid overload, and chronic anemia. It is also crucial to treat his UTI promptly and effectively, manage his constipation and wound infection, and prevent thrombosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and comfortable.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema. He has a significant cardiac history, including coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation with ventricular fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. He was recently extubated and is currently comfortable.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 79/37 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. His physical examination is notable for a lack of peripheral pulses and skin changes.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6, hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 274. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and magnesium level of 1.1 mg/dL. His troponin level is 0.08 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include captopril, spironolactone, torsemide, lasix, ativan, and amytriptyline. He is also receiving antibiotics for a urinary tract infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and recent intubation make him at risk for recurrent episodes of hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation, as well as his current use of anti-arrhythmic medications, make him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's urinary tract infection and recent use of antibiotics make him at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Constipation: The patient's use of medications such as ativan and amytriptyline, as well as his history of constipation, make him at risk for developing constipation.
5. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and recent drop in hemoglobin level make him at risk for further anemia.
6. R leg ulcer: The patient's history of surgical debridement and current use of wound care products make him at risk for further complications related to his leg ulcer.
7. Hepatitis C: The patient's diagnosis of hepatitis C and recent deferral of treatment make him at risk for further liver damage.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent lack of thyroid replacement therapy make him at risk for further hypothyroidism."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and breathing comfortably.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday, Captopril decreased from 50mg tid to 37.5mg tid, for
   afterload reduction, d/t lower BP
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - increase torsemide to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - start metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] po
   - Goal I/O negative 1L (yesterday was positive 700mL), will hold lasix
   gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed later today to meet diuresis
   needs (was given 500mg PO chlorothiazide yesterday evening)
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing (K repleted this morning)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)

   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit. Hct stable this AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old gentleman who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to episodes of flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a significant cardiac history, including coronary artery bypass grafting, atrioventricular valve replacement, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient is currently extubated and breathing comfortably. His current condition is stable, with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 100 mmHg to prevent further episodes of flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure increases the risk of further episodes, particularly if his SBP remains high or if he experiences anxiety or other triggers.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease and atrioventricular valve replacement, increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture for ESBL Klebsiella and his history of bacteremia increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications, including warfarin and heparin, increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if his INR is not at goal.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and his current use of laxatives increase the risk of bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Wound Complications: The patient's right leg ulcer and his history of surgical debridement increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection, necrosis, or delayed healing.
7. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia and his recent drop in hemoglobin concentration increase the risk of anemia-related complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a history of flash pulmonary edema. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, and the note highlights several ongoing medical issues and treatment plans.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 79/37 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, and their respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 274 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and their troponin level is 0.08 ng/mL.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema, which has required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's cardiac history, including CABG and AFib, makes it likely that the episodes are related to hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and diastolic dysfunction. The patient has been treated with diuretics and has had significant diuresis during their stay.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known CAD and has undergone CABG. Recent catheterization showed 2VD, patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction.
4. Bloodstream infections: The patient has had recurrent bloodstream infections, which has led to the removal of their AICD.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, but with a recent 4-point Hct drop on admission that has been stable since.
6. Constipation: The patient has been treated with an aggressive bowel regimen to manage constipation.
7. UTI: The patient's urine culture has been positive for ESBL Klebsiella, and they are being treated with meropenem.
8. R leg ulcer: The patient has a surgical wound that has been debrided and is being treated with wound care.
9. DM 2: The patient has type 2 diabetes and is being treated with glargine, humalog, and a diabetic diet.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated with atorvastatin.
11. Hep C: The patient is being deferred from treatment for now, but may be reassessed in the future.
12. Hypothyroidism: The patient is not currently on thyroid replacement therapy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's goal is to control triggers of anxiety and constipation, and to maintain a blood pressure goal of <100 mmHg.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's goal is to control diuresis and maintain a negative fluid balance.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient's goal is to continue ACE-I, BB, statin, and ASA 81mg daily.
4. Bloodstream infections: The patient's goal is to complete a 14-day course of meropenem.
5. Anemia: The patient's goal is to monitor Hct levels daily.
6. Constipation: The patient's goal is to continue an aggressive bowel regimen.
7. UTI: The patient's goal is to complete a 14-day course of meropenem.
8. R leg ulcer: The patient's goal is to continue wound care and manage pain with oxycodone.
9. DM 2: The patient's goal is to continue glargine, humalog, and a diabetic diet.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's goal is to continue atorvastatin.
11. Hep C: The patient's goal is to defer treatment for now, but may be reassessed in the future.
12. Hypothyroidism: The patient's goal is to monitor TSH levels and consider thyroid replacement therapy if necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to the CCU and hopefully to the floor or STR soon."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and breathing comfortably.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday, Captopril decreased from 50mg tid to 37.5mg tid, for
   afterload reduction, d/t lower BP
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - increase torsemide to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - start metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] po
   - Goal I/O negative 1L (yesterday was positive 700mL), will hold lasix
   gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed later today to meet diuresis
   needs (was given 500mg PO chlorothiazide yesterday evening)
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing (K repleted this morning)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, but was positive 700mL yesterday.
   -Diuril boluses prn to maintain Is and Os at goal; goal 1L negative
   today
   -Other diuretic changes/types listed above under hypoxic respiratory
   failure plan
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed. No active chest pain.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5.  INR today not at goal.
   - give 10mg coumadin today, then resume 5mg daily coumadin
   - continue heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit. Hct stable this AM.
   - check daily Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   - confirm weight-bearing status of the foot with vascular
   .
   # DM 2:
   -glargine at bedtime
   -humalong SS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy given
   that last TSH was appropriate

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued. His BP is improved
   to 108-110 systolic on the lower dosage of captopril 37.5 mg tid.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo gentleman with multiple recent intubations following episodes of
   flash pulm edema, with significant cardiac hx including CABG, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **]
   AVR, hx VF arrest s/p AICD placement (removed because of bacteremia).
   Patient now extubated and breathing comfortably.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient has had multiple episodes of
   flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation during his multiple MICU and
   CCU admissions, most likely [**1-26**] hypoxic respiratory failure (other
   potential etiologies include ACS or PE, although these are less likely
   given his history, unchanged ECGs, and heparin/coumadin treatment).
   Perhaps anxiety provoked his flash pulmonary edema, but unclear if
   vice-versa is the case. Will attempt to control triggers of anxiety and
   constipation.  Now extubated.  Main focus at this time is controlling
   BPs and PE triggers.  Goal SBP < 100 to prevent flash pulmonary edema.
   - Yesterday, Captopril decreased from 50mg tid to 37.5mg tid, for
   afterload reduction, d/t lower BP
   - Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily
   - increase torsemide to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - start metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] po
   - Goal I/O negative 1L (yesterday was positive 700mL), will hold lasix
   gtt for now and bolus diuril as needed later today to meet diuresis
   needs (was given 500mg PO chlorothiazide yesterday evening)
   - Lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing (K repleted this morning)
   - Amytriptyline started [**9-21**], will monitor QT interval (slightly
   prolonged on recent EKG)
   - Continue Ativan prn for anxiety
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   # Pump:  Patient presented with fluid overload, likely exacerbation of
   well known systolic CHF (EF 20%) and diastolic dysfunction. Pt with
   significant diuresis this stay, but was positive 700mL yesterday.
   -Diuril boluses prn to maintain Is and Os at goal; goal 1L negative
   today
   -Other diuretic changes/types listed above under hypoxic respiratory
   failure plan
   .
   # Coronaries:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD,
   patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction with no interventions
   performed. No active chest pain.
   - Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, ASA 81mg daily
   .
   # Rhythm:  Currently in sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Patient has history
   of VF arrest with AICD removal given recurrent bloodstream infections.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Blood pressure: Tolerating SBPs in the 80s. Goal SBP < 100.
   - Anti-hypertensive regimen as above.
   .
   # AVR: Goal INR 2.5 - 3.5.  INR today not at goal.
   - give 10mg coumadin today, then resume 5mg daily coumadin
   - continue heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin
   .
   # UTI: Pt urine culture positive for ESBL Klebsiella.
   - Continue Meropenem for 14 d course (day 1=[**9-20**]; final day = 10/10/9).
   .
   #  Constipation:  Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
   - Patient denies prior colonoscopy; consider colonoscopy as outpatient
   .
   # Anemia
 Patient with chronic anemia, but with more recent 4-point
   Hct drop on admission that has been stable since. Guiac negative, no
   obvious bleeding source found on exam.  Given that Hct has been
   consistently low, suspect that Hct 27.3 was likely a spurious result.
   Retic count high nl when adjusted for low crit. Hct stable this AM.
   - check daily Hct
   .
   # R leg ulcer: s/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed
   [**9-9**]; no longer with wound vac in place.
   - Continue wound care per wound care recs.
   - Standing Tylenol
   - Oxycodone prn pain
   - confirm weight-bearing status of the foot with vascular
   .
   # DM 2:
   -glargine at bedtime
   -humalong SS
   -diabetic diet
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   # Hep C:  Per Hepatology, deferring treatment for now. [**Month (only) 60**] consider
   reassessment if patient continues to improve.

   TITLE:    ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Comprehensive Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10454**] today and
   I concur with the history, physical examination, assessment and
   treatment plan. The physical examination documented above is consistent
   with mine today.   Mr. [**Known lastname 10165**] is well known to the CCU due to a
   prolonged hospitalization complicated by recurrent requirements for
   intubation for flash pulmonary edema.  It is felt that these episodes
   result from changes in the systolic BP (to 140-160 mmHg).
   Over the past 24 hours, his diuresis has continued. His BP is improved
   to 108-110 systolic on the lower dosage of captopril 37.5 mg tid.
   He remains symptomatically improved without episodes of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   The treatment plan was discussed with the patient and all questions
   addressed.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to flash pulmonary edema, requiring intubation. He has a significant cardiac history, including CABG, AVR, and VF arrest. He is currently extubated and breathing comfortably. His current vital signs are:

* T: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 60 bpm (53-70 bpm)
* BP: 79/37 mmHg (45-101/52 mmHg)
* RR: 15 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%

His physical examination is notable for 1+ pitting edema in his right leg and right foot bandaged. His cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm with a loud second heart sound.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.6-6.0 K/uL
* Hct: 22.6-23.5%
* Plt: 274-281 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1-1.1 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 51-175 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.9/150.0/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 23/3/0.08, Differential-Neuts: 88.4%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 5.6%, Mono: 5.2%, Eos: 0.6%, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: Continue Spironolactone 25mg daily, increase torsemide to 40mg, and start metolazone 5mg PO.
* Fluid overload: Diuril boluses prn to maintain I/O at goal, goal 1L negative today.
* Coronaries: Continue ACE-I, BB, statin, and ASA 81mg daily.
* Rhythm: Monitor on telemetry.
* Blood pressure: Tolerate SBPs in the 80s, goal SBP < 100.
* AVR: Give 10mg coumadin today, then resume 5mg daily coumadin, and continue heparin gtt until therapeutic on warfarin.
* UTI: Continue Meropenem for 14-day course.
* Constipation: Continue aggressive bowel regimen.
* Anemia: Check daily Hct.
* R leg ulcer: Continue wound care per wound care recs.
* DM 2: Continue glargine at bedtime, humalong SS, and diabetic diet.
* Hyperlipidemia: Continue Atorvastatin.
* Hep C: Deferring treatment for now.
* Hypothyroidism: Not currently on thyroid replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Fluid overload and pulmonary edema
* Hypertension and cardiac complications
* UTI and bacteremia
* Constipation and bowel obstruction
* Anemia and bleeding
* Wound infection and complications
* Hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease
* Hepatitis C and liver disease
* Hypothyroidism and thyroid dysfunction

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
