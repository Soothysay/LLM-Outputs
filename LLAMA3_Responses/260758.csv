   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s).
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   His poor prognosis was discussed with the family. Will switch
   ventilators. Will rotate pt to see if we can optimize V/Q match.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field
   .
   9. PPX: INR therapeutic on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis; Famotidine for
   stress ulcer prophylaxis; colace and senna PRN
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  His pupils are fixed and
   dilated indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological
   catastrophe. He is bradycardic; may be secondary to infarction vs.
   [**Location (un) **] reflex vs  medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun aborted [**2-9**] bradycardia
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
 likely to weigh in on
   brain death
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0
 3.7
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation with PRN paralytic
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic.  Etiology for renal failure is
   likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L
   NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the ED with no output since. No response to
   Lasix. Renal failure likely to worse with epinephrine and severe
   bradycardia.
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field
   .
   9. PPX: INR therapeutic on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis; Famotidine for
   stress ulcer prophylaxis; colace and senna PRN

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or new ischemic event. He has a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD. The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 34.3°C (93.7°F)
* HR: 29 bpm (bradycardic)
* BP: 118/58 mmHg
* RR: 28 breaths/min
* SpO2: 95%

The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a FiO2 of 100% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His pupils are fixed and dilated, indicating either medication effect (paralytic) or neurological catastrophe.

The patient has the following medical complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The etiology is unclear, but it is likely due to VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or new ischemic event. The patient is bradycardic, which may be secondary to infarction or medication effect.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilator support, with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. Weaning vent settings as tolerated and sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering are planned.
3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient's current electrolyte and acid-base status is increasingly acidotic and hyperkalemic. The etiology is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. Monitoring volume status, urine electrolytes, and UA, and holding ACE and renally dosed meds are planned.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has an EF of 35-40% and mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. Fluids will be given to try to preserve kidney function, and respiratory status will be monitored.
5. Elevated WBC: The patient's WBC count is 18.8, which is likely due to stress response to cardiac arrest or NSTEMI. Blood cultures, urine culture, and continued monitoring are planned.
6. DM: The patient's DM is managed with Lantus and regular insulin sliding scale while NPO.
7. FEN: The patient is NPO for now and receiving IV fluids.
8. ACCESS: The patient has R femoral triple lumen, L arterial line, and L intraosseous access placed in the field.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is CCU for now. The patient's family has been notified, and communication with the healthcare proxy has been confirmed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   1. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  Neurologic etiologies
   such as seizure or stroke are also possible.  Given troponin elevation,
   most likely a cardiac event.  Bradycardia may be secondary to
   infarction vs. medication effect given that he was on a b-blocker,
   although this is less likely.
   - cooling protocol with Arctic Sun
   - trend enzymes and labs
   - neurology consult, 48 hour EEG per protocol
   - sedation with Fentanyl/Versed and paralytics PRN for shivering
   - aspirin, lipitor for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is 3.0, can re-address in AM
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Fentanyl/Versed for sedation
   .
   3. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Current electrolytes and acid/base status is
   stable.  Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion.  Per report, pt received ~2L NS at the OSH and 1L NS in the
   ED.
   - NS bolus to perfuse kidneys
   - monitor volume status
   - urine electrolyes, UA
   - hold ACE, renally dose meds
   .
   4. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubed, has
   mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - fluids to try to preserve kidney function
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE
   .
   5. ELEVATED WBC: Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI.
   - blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   - hold on antibiotics for now
   .
   6. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO
   .
   7. FEN: NPO for now; IV fluids
   .
   8. ACCESS: R femoral triple lumen; L arterial line; L intraosseous
   access placed in the field
   .
   9. PPX: INR therapeutic on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis; Famotidine for
   stress ulcer prophylaxis; colace and senna PRN

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to a cardiac event, possibly related to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. The patient's cardiac arrest was complicated by bradycardia, which may be secondary to infarction or medication effect.

The patient is currently intubated and on ventilator support with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. He is anuric, and his renal failure is likely due to ATN secondary to shock and poor perfusion. The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of CAD and cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to pulmonary edema and possible aspiration.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuric status and ATN suggest a high risk of further renal deterioration, which can lead to acute kidney injury and potentially chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's anuric status and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of CHF and DM increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of DM and current treatment with insulin and sliding scale insulin increase the risk of hyperglycemia, which can worsen cardiovascular outcomes.
7. Hypotension: The patient's treatment with dopamine and other vasopressors increases the risk of hypotension, which can further compromise cardiac and renal function.
8. Neurologic complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and possible neurologic etiologies increase the risk of neurologic complications, including stroke, seizure, and cognitive impairment.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical treatment to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care after neuro
   status is more delineated.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to have patient lie on the right side to improve V/Q match
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.
   - f/u on fibrinogen and RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care after neuro
   status is more delineated.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to have patient lie on the right side to improve V/Q match
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.
   - f/u on fibrinogen and RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor

   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key points as follows:

**Cardiac Arrest:** The patient suffered cardiac arrest due to VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. The patient was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours, which was aborted due to bradycardia to 20s. The patient is currently on dopamine and isoproterenol to improve heart rate and blood pressure.

**Anoxic Brain Injury:** The patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is unclear how long the patient was out. The patient has no brain stem reflex except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.

**Respiratory Failure:** The patient is currently on a ventilator, with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT. The patient's PaO2 improved significantly after being turned to lie on the right side.

**Coagulopathy:** The patient's INR and PTT are elevated after FFP wore off, which may be due to liver failure given elevated LFTs or DIC.

**Rhythm:** The patient is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol, but has a history of Afib on coumadin.

**Anuric Renal Failure:** The patient's renal failure is likely due to ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. The patient has a femoral HD line and is on CVVH.

**Congestive Heart Failure:** The patient has an EF of 35-40% and mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.

**Leukocytosis:** The patient's WBC is down-trending, likely due to stress response to cardiac arrest or NSTEMI.

**Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient's diabetes is managed with home insulin regimen of Lantus and regular insulin sliding scale while NPO.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. **Worsening of anoxic brain injury:** The patient's poor neuro prognosis and lack of brain stem reflexes indicate a high risk of worsening anoxic brain injury.
2. **DIC:** The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may progress to DIC, leading to bleeding complications.
3. **Renal failure:** The patient's anuric renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. **Cardiac arrhythmias:** The patient's history of Afib and current sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. **Infection:** The patient's grossly infected UA and leukocytosis may lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. **Gastrointestinal bleeding:** The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. **Pulmonary edema:** The patient's mild pulmonary edema on chest CT may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent these complications and ensure optimal management of their condition."

   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.  Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s.
   - discontinue isoproterenol today
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.  Fibrinogen normal, arguing against DIC.
   - f/u on RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - d/c isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH

   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday

   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He has a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. The patient has been on life support, including a ventilator, dopamine, and isoproterenol, and has undergone dialysis. His neurologic status is poor, with fixed and dilated pupils, and he has no brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the ventilator.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event. He was on a cooling protocol, which was aborted due to bradycardia. The patient's coagulation profile is concerning, with an elevated INR and PTT after fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was administered.

The patient has anoxic brain injury, respiratory failure, anuric renal failure, congestive heart failure, leukocytosis, and diabetes. He is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, multi-organ failure, and poor outcomes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
2. Multi-organ failure: The patient's anuric renal failure, anoxic brain injury, and congestive heart failure put him at risk for multi-organ failure.
3. Poor outcomes: The patient's poor neurologic status and anoxic brain injury make his prognosis very poor, and he is at risk for poor outcomes.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulation profile is concerning, and he is at risk for bleeding complications, particularly with the use of anticoagulants.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current use of dopamine and isoproterenol make him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and his history of diabetes make him at risk for infections, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of diabetes and his current use of anticoagulants make him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation profile and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anuric renal failure with dialysis and monitor his electrolyte levels.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further neurologic deterioration.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent infections.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.  Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s.
   - discontinue isoproterenol today
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.  Fibrinogen normal, arguing against DIC.
   - f/u on RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - d/c isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or new ischemic event. He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours, which was aborted due to bradycardia. The patient's pupils are fixed and dilated, indicating poor neurologic status. He has been intubated and is on a ventilator, with clear lungs but diminished breath sounds. His cardiac status is being monitored, and he is receiving dopamine and isoproterenol to support his blood pressure and heart rate.

The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD. He has undergone cardiac arrest and has anoxic brain injury, with no brainstem reflexes except for overbreathing on the vent. He is at risk for neurologic injury and has poor neurologic prognosis.

The patient's labs show elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, and an abnormal INR and PTT, which may indicate coagulopathy. He has anuric renal failure, likely due to ATN, and is receiving CVVH. He has a history of Afib and is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Neurologic injury: The patient's anoxic brain injury and poor neurologic prognosis put him at risk for further neurologic decline or even death.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal INR and PTT, along with thrombocytopenia, may indicate coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuric renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF, along with his current cardiac status, put him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's grossly infected UA and elevated WBC may indicate a risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis, septic shock, or other complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and he may be at risk for further respiratory decline or failure if not managed properly.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NPO status and history of DM may put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, or malnutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust his care accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy, including monitoring his INR and PTT, and adjusting his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure, including monitoring his creatinine and electrolyte levels, and adjusting his dialysis therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status, including his heart rate and blood pressure, and adjust his cardiac medications as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status, including his oxygen saturation and lung sounds, and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status, including his bowel movements and electrolyte levels, and adjust his medications and nutrition as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk, including his WBC and blood cultures, and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue
   from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Despite better HR and blood
   pressure, patient's pupils are fixed and dilated indicating poor
   neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient currently has
   completely no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient
   breathing over the vent.
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol, wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - f/u EP recs
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up after FFP is
   wearing off
   - hold on b-blocker while hypotensive on dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue amiodarone for arrhythmia
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care after neuro
   status is more delineated.
   .
   #. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.  PaO2 was low yesterday but after patient was turned to lie on
   his right side, PaO2 improved significantly.  O2 sats have always been
   good though.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to have patient lie on the right side to improve V/Q match
   .
   #. COAGULOPATHY: INR and PTT [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP wore off.  Together with
   thrombocytopenia, concerning for DIC. Could also be due to liver
   failure given elevated LFTs.
   - f/u on fibrinogen and RBC smears
   - f/u on repeat LFTs
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR is [**Month/Year (2) 3779**] after FFP worn off
   - continue dopamine and isoproterenol
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia yesterday
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

**Cardiac Arrest and Anoxic Brain Injury:**

* The patient suffered cardiac arrest, likely due to VT/Vfib secondary to scar tissue from prior infarction or a new ischemic event.
* The patient was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours, which had to be aborted due to bradycardia.
* The patient has no brainstem reflex except for overbreathing on the vent, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.

Potential complications:

* Increased risk of further neurologic injury or death due to anoxic brain injury.
* Potential for prolonged sedation and mechanical ventilation.

**Respiratory Failure:**

* The patient is currently on ventilator support, with mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
* PaO2 was low yesterday, but improved significantly after the patient was turned to lie on his right side.

Potential complications:

* Weaning from ventilator support may be challenging due to underlying respiratory failure.
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections may develop.

**Coagulopathy:**

* INR and PTT are elevated after FFP wore off, potentially indicating DIC or liver failure.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may worsen the coagulopathy.

Potential complications:

* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to coagulopathy.
* Increased risk of infection or sepsis due to impaired immune function.

**Renal Failure:**

* The patient has anuric renal failure, likely due to ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.
* CVVH was started on [**1-17**].

Potential complications:

* Further decline in renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.

**Other Complications:**

* Leukocytosis, potentially due to stress response to cardiac arrest or NSTEMI.
* Infected urine, potentially leading to sepsis.
* Congestive heart failure, potentially worsening with continued hypotension and bradycardia.
* DM, potentially requiring insulin adjustments.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications, including cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, renal failure, and sepsis. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these complications are necessary to improve the patient's outcomes."

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary
   edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after cardiac arrest. He has a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD. His current condition is critical, with poor neurologic status, anoxic brain injury, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is intubated and on ventilator support, with a fever and leukocytosis. His renal function is anuric, and he has liver injury with rising LFTs and INR. He has a history of AFib on coumadin, but is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine. His cardiac function is compromised, with an EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying septic process.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's poor neurologic status and anoxic brain injury may lead to permanent brain damage or death.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued ventilator support to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's anuric renal failure may worsen if not addressed, leading to further compromise of his overall condition.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's liver injury may lead to further compromise of his hepatic function, potentially exacerbating his anuric renal failure and other complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen his condition if not addressed.
8. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, and he may require further interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider further interventions to improve his brain perfusion.
2. Continue ventilator support and consider weaning as tolerated.
3. Address the patient's anuric renal failure with CVVH and consider further interventions to improve his renal function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider further interventions to improve his hepatic function.
5. Consider further interventions to improve the patient's cardiac function, such as inotropes or vasopressors.
6. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and consider further interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
7. Consider further interventions to address the patient's infection, such as antibiotics or further diagnostic testing.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his care plan as necessary to address any new complications or concerns."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.    On pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   80%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock liver in
   the setting of hypotension in the past. Fibrinogen normal, arguing
   against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum
   culture grew out 1+ gram neg diplococci.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**]) for now
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after cardiac arrest. He has a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, with a PEEP of 16, PS of 5, and FiO2 of 80%. His lungs sound clear but diminished, and he has mild pulmonary edema on a chest CT.
* Neurological: The patient has no brainstem function, except for spontaneous respirations, and is unresponsive. He has fixed pupils bilaterally and no oculocephalic reflex.
* Cardiac: The patient has a regular rhythm, but his heart rate is bradycardic. He has a history of Afib and is currently on dopamine, which is being weaned as tolerated.
* Renal: The patient has anuric renal failure, likely due to ATN, and is on CVVH. His INR is rising, indicating possible shock liver.
* Liver: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and his INR is 3.0.
* Blood: The patient's WBC is down-trending, and he has grossly infected urine with a negative urine culture.
* Sputum: The patient's sputum culture grew out 1+ gram neg diplococci.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires ongoing ventilator support.
2. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's neurological status is poor, and he has no brainstem function.
3. Liver injury: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and his INR is rising, indicating possible shock liver.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires ongoing CVVH.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC is down-trending, and he has grossly infected urine.
6. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of Afib and is currently on dopamine, which may affect his cardiac rhythm.
7. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is currently intubated, with mild pulmonary edema on a chest CT.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to wean dopamine and isoproterenol as tolerated.
2. Continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care.
3. Trend LFTs and follow coags.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status.
5. Continue to follow up with neurology and EEG.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
7. Continue to hold sedation and monitor the patient's level of consciousness.
8. Continue to hold ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control.
10. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is to the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient currently has no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent, not arousable despite being off
   sedation, indicating very poor neuro prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lungs sound clear but diminished, chest CT with mild pulmonary
   edema.    Requiring PEEP 16 and FiO2 of 60%.  The most likely mechanism
   of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock liver in
   the setting of hypotension in the past. Fibrinogen normal, arguing
   against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LEUKOCYTOSIS: WBC down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress
   response to cardiac arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also
   has grossly infected UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum
   culture grew out 1+ gram neg diplococci.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**]) for now
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 35-40%.  Pt is already intubated,
   has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 98%.
* His heart rate is 46 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 131/54 mmHg.
* His pupils are fixed and non-reactive, indicating poor neurologic status.
* He has no brainstem function, except for spontaneous respirations.
* His liver function tests are abnormal, with an elevated INR and serum bilirubin levels.
* He has anuric renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated.
* He has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL.
* He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
* He has congestive heart failure, with an estimated ejection fraction of 35-40%.
* He has a history of diabetes mellitus and is currently receiving insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of his neurologic status, potentially leading to brain death.
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to ongoing anuric renal failure.
* Progression of liver injury, potentially leading to liver failure.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to his infected urinary tract and positive blood cultures.
* Further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Development of respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Development of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

The patient's family has been informed of his poor neurologic prognosis and is considering withdrawing life-sustaining therapies. The healthcare team is working with the family to discuss goals of care and potential treatment options."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary
   edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR

   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His neurological status is poor, with fixed pupils, no brainstem reflexes, and minimal cortical function. He has anoxic brain injury and is at risk of further neurologic damage.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's brain injury is likely due to the cardiac arrest, and he is at risk of further neurologic damage.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, and his chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema. He is currently on pressure support ventilation with PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient spiked a fever yesterday, and his WBC count is down-trending. His urine culture was negative, but his sputum culture grew out 1+ gram negative diplococci.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to ATN secondary to shock and poor perfusion. He is currently on CVVH, but his filter clotted yesterday.
5. Liver injury: The patient's LFTs, INR, and PTT are rising, indicating possible shock liver injury.
6. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is currently sinus, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin.

Plan:

1. Continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated, with a goal HR of 60s and MAP of 55.
2. Continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI.
3. Hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up.
4. Hold on beta blocker for hypotension.
5. Follow up with neurology and EEG consults.
6. Continue to wean vent settings as tolerated.
7. Start vancomycin today, dose by level given patient on CVVH.
8. Follow up with sputum culture speciation and sensitivities.
9. Continue to monitor WBC and fever curve.
10. Continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care.
11. Trend LFTs and follow coags.
12. Hold off on coumadin given INR >2.
13. Continue dopamine, wean as tolerated.
14. Monitor respiratory status and continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care.
15. Continue home insulin regimen of Lantus and regular insulin sliding scale while NPO.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further neurologic damage due to anoxic brain injury.
2. Respiratory failure due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure due to anuric renal failure.
4. Liver failure due to liver injury.
5. Cardiac arrest due to rhythm disturbances.
6. Infection due to fever and leukocytosis.
7. Bleeding due to liver injury and anuric renal failure.
8. Metabolic disturbances due to diabetes mellitus and liver injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   [**2-9**] renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's pupils are non-reactive
   indicating poor neurologic status.  Neurology consult states patient
   has no brainstem function seen on exam other than patient breathing
   over the vent.  However, overnight on [**1-18**] patient was noted to have
   cough and gag reflex.   Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   indicating despite some brainstem function, cortical function is
   minimal at this time. Patient was initially on dopamine 15,
   isoproterenol 2, HR initially around 40, sBP 110s, but since 6pm on
   [**1-17**], HR in the 60s-70s, sBP in the 130s.  Overnight on [**1-17**], dopamine
   titrated down to 5, isoproterenol down to 1. HR 50-60s, sBP in the
   100s. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is being titrated
   down.
   - continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR
   60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is
   unclear how long patient was out.  To protect him from neurologic
   injury, patient was on arctic sun briefly (for 6h) which had to be
   stopped for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for
   overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some corneal
   reflex in left eye, has gag reflex.   EEG is not completely flat, but
   pt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating very poor neuro
   prognosis.
   - continue to hold sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - will re-discuss with family regarding goals of care given poor neuro
   prognosis, in the presence of interpreter
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, Requiring PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch, from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue ceftriaxone, start vanc today
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever yesterday [**1-18**].  WBC
   down-trending.  Likely in the setting of stress response to cardiac
   arrest, also possibly due to NSTEMI. Patient also has grossly infected
   UA, but urine culture was negative.  Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram
   neg diplococci. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.
   - continue ceftriaxone (day1: [**1-17**])
   - add vanc today, dose by level given pt on CVVH
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivities
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. ANURIC RENAL FAILURE: Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p
   shock and poor perfusion.  Patient was seen by renal yesterday, and a
   femoral HD line was placed.  CVVH was started on [**1-17**], filter clotted
   on the afternoon of [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - continue to trend creatinine and lytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT, INR and PTT rising, indicating possible shock
   liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen normal, arguing against
   DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on coumadin given INR >2
   - continue dopamine, wean as tolerated
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient had a repeat TTE on yesterday.  EF
   of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is intubated, has mild pulmonary
   edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - continue home insulin regimen of Lantus
   - regular insulin sliding scale while NPO

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 95%. His heart rate is 67 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 128/63 mmHg. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with non-reactive pupils and minimal cortical function. He has a cough and gag reflex, but is not responsive to light, voice, or noxious stimuli. He has been on a cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours, which was discontinued due to bradycardia.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient sustained cardiac arrest, and it is unclear how long he was out. He has some brainstem function, but minimal cortical function, indicating a poor neuroprognosis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has bibasilar crackles on lung exam, and chest CT shows mild pulmonary edema. He is currently on a ventilator with PEEP 16, PS 5, and FiO2 of 80%.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient spiked a fever yesterday, and his WBC is down-trending. He has grossly infected urine, but urine culture was negative. Sputum culture grew out 1+ gram negative diplococci.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient's etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. He has a femoral HD line and is currently on CVVH.
5. Liver injury: The patient's LFT, INR, and PTT are rising, indicating possible shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen is normal, arguing against DIC.
6. Rhythm: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, but is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
7. Congestive heart failure: The patient has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR, with an EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue to titrate down on dopamine wean as tolerated with goal HR 60s and MAP 55.
2. Continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI.
3. Hold off on heparin for now given INR is climbing up.
4. Hold on beta-blocker for hypotension.
5. Follow up with neurology and EEG.
6. Wean vent settings as tolerated.
7. Continue ceftriaxone and add vanc today.
8. Continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care.
9. Trend LFTs and coags.
10. Monitor respiratory status and continue CVVH if family wants to continue all care.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is unclear at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an unresponsive elderly man, intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 128/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has a central line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, and he has a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci. He has been treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of developing cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and elevated liver enzymes suggest that he may have an underlying infection.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest that he may be at risk for developing renal failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and positive blood culture suggest that he may be at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsiveness and anisocoric pupils suggest that he may have neurological complications, such as stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen based on the results of the blood culture.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's ventilator settings to improve his oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Consider adding medications to the patient's treatment regimen to manage his atrial fibrillation and reduce his risk of developing cardiac arrest.
5. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to discuss the patient's renal function and potential need for dialysis.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to discuss the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and potential need for endoscopy or other diagnostic tests.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to discuss the patient's neurological symptoms and potential need for further evaluation or treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued this AM.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
- Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - discuss d/c
ing spinal collar with Ortho spine
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - Pull fem line given concern for infection
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place for now, no CVVH since
   [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He is currently intubated and on a ventilator, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 128/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has a fever and leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 12.9. His renal function is oliguric, with a urine output of 20-30 cc/hr. His liver function tests are trending down, and his coagulation studies are stable. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate the presence of an infection. The sputum culture grew out Moraxella, and the blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, which may have caused an anoxic brain injury. He is currently unresponsive, with minimal cortical function, and is at risk for developing further neurologic damage.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator, with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 50%. He has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR, which may indicate hypoxic respiratory failure.
4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is improving, but he is still oliguric. He has a history of chronic kidney disease, which may have contributed to his current renal function.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's liver function tests are trending down, which may indicate liver injury. His coagulation studies are stable, which suggests that he does not have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
6. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. He is at risk for developing further rhythm disturbances, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
7. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, which may have contributed to his current condition. He is at risk for developing further heart failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and neurologic status closely.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.
3. Consider administering antibiotics to treat the patient's suspected infection.
4. Consider performing a head CT or MRI to rule out further neurologic damage.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider performing a renal biopsy if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider performing a liver biopsy if necessary.
7. Consider administering anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
8. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function.
9. Consider performing a chest CT or MRI to assess the patient's pulmonary edema.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider administering electrolyte supplements as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is
   being titrated down,  currently at 3.5 mcg/kg/min
   - continue to wean dopamine as tolerated with goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   - continue CVVH for now
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final  aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycine, dosed by level given renal failure/CVVH (day
   1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place, CVVH was restarted
   yesterday after clotting on [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue CVVH for now
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2
   - continue Dopamine, weaning as tolerates
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR
   - monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for now
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 10u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine 15 and isoproterenol 2.  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], dopamine is
   being titrated down,  currently at 3.5 mcg/kg/min
   - continue to wean dopamine as tolerated with goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation.  On
   pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most
   likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from pulmonary edema,
   retrocardiac consolidation and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   - continue CVVH for now
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD who presented with cardiac arrest. He was successfully resuscitated but remains unresponsive with minimal cortical function. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has developed oliguric renal failure, liver injury, and respiratory failure. He has also had a fever and leukocytosis. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's poor neurologic prognosis and lack of responsiveness indicate a high risk of anoxic brain injury.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation make him at risk for VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a high risk of sepsis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate a high risk of further renal deterioration.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy indicate a high risk of further liver injury.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of further respiratory deterioration.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD, MI, and CHF make him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
8. Infectious Complications: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever indicate a high risk of further infectious complications, such as bacteremia and sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management of his multiple organ dysfunctions. He should continue to receive mechanical ventilation and sedation. His antibiotics should be continued, and his blood cultures should be monitored. He should also receive CVVH for his oliguric renal failure and continue to receive dialysis. His liver function should be monitored, and his coagulopathy should be managed. His respiratory status should be closely monitored, and he should receive prophylaxis for VAP. His cardiovascular status should be closely monitored, and he should receive prophylaxis for cardiac arrhythmias. His infectious status should be closely monitored, and he should receive prophylaxis for further infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued this AM.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
- Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - discuss d/c
ing spinal collar with Ortho spine
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - Pull fem line given concern for infection
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place for now, no CVVH since

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued this AM.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - continue aspirin for possible NSTEMI
   - hold anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold on b-blocker for hypotension
   .
#. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic sun termina
[**Male First Name (un) **] early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex except for overbrea
thing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have some pupillary reflexes, a co
rneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.   Preliminary EEG demonstrates som
e epileptic features and frontal rhythmic delta, but no seizures. However, patie
nt not arousable despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosi
s. Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are await
ing a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions.
- Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u final EEG read
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - discuss d/c
ing spinal collar with Ortho spine
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100.  WBC up slightly from [**1-19**], but
   essentially stable.  Patient had grossly infected UA, but negative
   urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for GPC
s in clusters.
   - Pull fem line given concern for infection
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. Femoral HD line in place for now, no CVVH since
   [**1-18**].
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10179**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential:

1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxia may have caused anoxic brain injury, leading to poor neurologic prognosis and potential long-term disability or death.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and intubation increase the risk of developing VAP, which can lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and increased mortality.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring dialysis and increasing the risk of mortality.
4. Liver Injury: The patient's ongoing liver injury may lead to further liver dysfunction, increasing the risk of bleeding, coagulopathy, and mortality.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, and decreased cardiac function increase the risk of further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and sputum culture for Moraxella, as well as the presence of a femoral line, increase the risk of developing sepsis and infection.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and hypoxia may lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory acidosis, respiratory failure, and increased mortality.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and possible bowel obstruction increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as sepsis, perforation, and death.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications, including:

1. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's cardiac status, including cardiac rhythm and function.
2. Ongoing respiratory support and weaning of ventilator settings as tolerated.
3. Management of the patient's renal function, including continued monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes, and consideration of dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitoring and management of the patient's liver function, including continued monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation studies.
5. Ongoing management of the patient's gastrointestinal status, including continued monitoring of bowel function and consideration of bowel regimen.
6. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's infection, including continued antibiotic therapy and consideration of surgical intervention if necessary.
7. Ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's neurologic status, including continued EEG monitoring and consideration of neurosurgical intervention if necessary.
8. Ongoing communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure that the patient's goals of care are respected and that the patient receives appropriate palliative care."

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled on [**1-21**].
   possible NSTEMI, on asa, no bb.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - holding anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR; though
   normalizing
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic
   sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have
   some pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag
   reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly
   increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or
   'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable despite
   being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family
   meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100 on [**1-20**] and 101 on [**1-21**].  WBC
   increasing by 2 since [**1-19**].  Patient had grossly infected UA, but
   negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for coag neg staph, and bcx from [**1-18**] also
   positive for GPC. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. No CVVH since [**1-18**], K+ is stable (normal). HD line
   pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD who presented with cardiac arrest. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various treatments and interventions.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is attributed to VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction, or new ischemic event.
* Anoxic brain injury: The patient has sustained an anoxic brain injury due to cardiac arrest, and his neurologic activity is limited. He is unresponsive, with some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is minimal.
* Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support, with bibasilar crackles on lung exam, and mild pulmonary edema on chest CT.
* Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with a WBC count increasing by 2 since admission. Sputum culture grew out Moraxella, and aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures are positive for coag neg staph and GPC.
* Oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, with UOP increasing to 20-30 cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.
* Liver injury: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and INR and PTT are stable, indicating likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension.
* Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine, but he has a history of Afib on coumadin.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR, and his EF is 30-35% on repeat TTE.
* DM: The patient's DM is being managed with Glargine 10u qHS and regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which could worsen his condition and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may progress, requiring more aggressive respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as CVVH or dialysis.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver injury may progress, leading to liver failure and increased risk of bleeding and infection.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiac tamponade.
* Neurological complications: The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or cerebral edema.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is pending further discussion with the family regarding his treatment options and prognosis."

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled on [**1-21**].
   possible NSTEMI, on asa, no bb.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - holding anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR; though
   normalizing
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic
   sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have
   some pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag
   reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly
   increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or
   'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable despite
   being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family
   meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100 on [**1-20**] and 101 on [**1-21**].  WBC
   increasing by 2 since [**1-19**].  Patient had grossly infected UA, but
   negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for coag neg staph, and bcx from [**1-18**] also
   positive for GPC. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. No CVVH since [**1-18**], K+ is stable (normal). HD line
   pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2 and prognosis
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - monitor respiratory status
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia and
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 10u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: post cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   [**1-20**]:
   - family discussion: no escalation of care (no pressors, DNR, do not
   re-intubate)
   - PIV x2 in, femoral CVL line, HD line and A-line removed
   - another daughter is coming from [**Country 249**] on [**Name (NI) 1583**]
   - family is ok with us removing the C-collar, but per spine, need MRI
   to clear c-spine
   - blood culture from [**1-18**] (drawn from A-line) also grew out GPC in
   clusters 2/4 bottles
   - blood culture from [**1-16**] grew out coag neg staph
   - [**Month/Day (4) **] trough: 12.7, given another dose of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] recheck tomorrow
   at 11am
   - palliative care: no recs
   - neuro: low threshould to start anti-epileptic meds if noting sz
   activities.  Meaningful recovery is very unlikely.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and has been in the ICU for several days. The patient has a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator with settings of PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of Afib and is currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine. The patient's EF is 30-35% on repeat TTE.
* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and has minimal cortical function per EEG. The patient has some brainstem function, including pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag reflex.
* Renal status: The patient has oliguric renal failure with a UOP of 20-30 cc/hr. The etiology is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion.
* Liver status: The patient has liver injury with trending down LFTs and stable INR and PTT.
* Infectious status: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.9. The patient's sputum culture grew out Moraxella, and blood cultures grew out coag neg staph and GPC.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low platelet count of 114.
* Endocrine status: The patient has DM and is receiving Glargine 10u qHS and regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
* Anoxic brain injury: The patient has sustained cardiac arrest and has minimal cortical function per EEG, indicating a poor neurologic prognosis.
* Oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal function is likely to worsen due to ATN and poor perfusion.
* Liver injury: The patient's liver function is likely to worsen due to shock liver and hypotension.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate the possibility of sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib and current sinus rhythm on dopamine make them at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding sedation and monitoring the patient's neurological status.
* Weaning vent settings as tolerated.
* Continuing Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin.
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and electrolytes.
* Following coags and holding off on Coumadin due to INR >2 and prognosis.
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and holding ACE and BB due to hypotension and bradycardia.
* Continuing DM management with Glargine 10u qHS and regular insulin sliding scale.
* Monitoring the patient's WBC and fever curve.
* Following up with final sputum and blood culture sensitivities.
* Considering d/c regular CXR.
* Trending creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication."

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: [**1-20**]
   In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], there is increasing sharpness
   of the pulmonary vessels, consistent with some improving elevation in
   pulmonary venous pressure. There are also may be some decrease in the
   retrocardiac lower lobe atelectasis in the left lung. Cardiomegaly
   persists.
   [**1-19**] EEG
   disorganization and slowing of the background rhythm with, at times,
   bifrontal semirhythmic delta activity with frequent embedded bifrontal
   spikes for runs of [**10-27**] seconds. This finding suggests potential for
   seizures and an underlying severe encephalopathy. Medications,
   toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are common causes. This
   finding may also be consistent with anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. There were no
   definite electrographic seizures contained in this study. Compared to
   the prior 24 hours, this study shows increase in brain activity. A
   routine EEG may be repeated in a couple of days to assess for any
   interval change.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST: Etiology includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia
   from renal failure, scar tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic
   event.  He was on cooling protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which
   had to be aborted because of bradycardia to 20s, which improved on
   dopamine and isoproterenol .  Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].
   Despite better HR and blood pressure, patient's neurologic activity off
   sedation remains limited.  Patient continues to be unresponsive,
   despite some brainstem function, and cortical function per EEG is
   minimal at this time. Isoproterenol discontinued on [**1-18**], Dopamine
   discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled on [**1-21**].
   possible NSTEMI, on asa, no bb.
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - holding anticoagulation given supratherapeutic INR; though
   normalizing
   .
   #. ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac arrest s/p arctic
   sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Patient had no brain stem reflex
   except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does have
   some pupillary reflexes, a corneal reflex in the left eye, and gag
   reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly
   increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or
   'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable despite
   being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family
   meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - Palliative Care to see family today
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles, chest CT with mild
   pulmonary edema.    CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14,
   PS 5, and FiO2 of 50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q
   mismatch from pulmonary edema and mediastinal hematoma.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Ceftriaxone & Vancomycin
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated around 100 on [**1-20**] and 101 on [**1-21**].  WBC
   increasing by 2 since [**1-19**].  Patient had grossly infected UA, but
   negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew out Moraxella. CXR showed
   retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final aerobic & anaerobic blood
   culture from [**2117-1-16**] positive for coag neg staph, and bcx from [**1-18**] also
   positive for GPC. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: UOP improving since admission, now ~ 20-30
   cc/hr. Etiology for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor
   perfusion. FeNa >1%. No CVVH since [**1-18**], K+ is stable (normal). HD line
   pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: LFT
s trending down, INR and PTT stable indicating
   likely shock liver in the setting of hypotension. Fibrinogen >100,
   arguing against DIC.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation for now
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib on coumadin.  However,
   currently in sinus rhythm on dopamine.
   - hold off on Coumadin given INR >2 and prognosis
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].  Pt is
   intubated, has mild pulmonary edema on chest CT and CXR.
   - CXR, consider d/c regular cxr
   - monitor respiratory status

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. He has a history of CAD, MI, CHF, DM, and Stage IV CKD. He was resuscitated and has been on a cooling protocol, but it was terminated due to bradycardia. He is currently on dopamine and isoproterenol, and his blood pressure and heart rate are stable. However, his neurological status is poor, and he is unresponsive with minimal cortical function. He has a DNR order and is awaiting a final family member from another country before making further decisions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's poor neurological status and EEG findings suggest a high likelihood of anoxic brain injury, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercapnia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to anuria, leading to further compromise of his already poor renal function.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's elevated LFTs and INR suggest liver injury, which can lead to coagulopathy and further complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and history of CHF make him at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to further complications and death.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may worsen, leading to further compromise of his already poor health.
9. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and poor nutritional status make him at risk for pressure ulcers, which can lead to further complications and death.
10. DVT and Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's immobility and poor circulation make him at risk for DVT and pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further complications and death."

   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and has been treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for suspected sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was on coumadin prior to admission. He is currently on telemetry and has a goal heart rate of 60s and mean arterial pressure of 55.
* Respiratory: The patient is on ventilator support with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient overbreathing on the vent.
* Neurological: The patient has a poor neurologic prognosis due to anoxic brain injury and is currently non-arousable.
* Renal: The patient has oliguric renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a urine output of 20-30 cc/hr.
* Liver: The patient has liver injury, with trending down liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
* Hematology: The patient has a white blood cell count of 12.9, with a stable WBC count and a fever curve.
* Infections: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-neg staph, and his sputum culture grew out Moraxella.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's positive blood culture and sputum culture
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and need for ventilator support
* Cardiac arrest due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest
* Renal failure due to the patient's oliguric renal failure and need for dialysis
* Liver failure due to the patient's liver injury and trending down LFTs
* Neurological deterioration due to the patient's anoxic brain injury and poor neurologic prognosis
* Infections due to the patient's positive blood culture and sputum culture

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to hold sedation
* F/u neuro recommendations
* Goal HR 60s and MAP 55
* Start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will stop if family decides to withdraw care
* Wean vent settings as tolerated
* Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone
* F/u final sputum and blood culture sensitivities
* F/u remaining blood cultures
* Continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
* F/u renal recommendations prn
* Continue to trend creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
* Start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to withdraw care
* Continue to monitor on telemetry
* Start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to withdraw care

The patient's family meeting is scheduled for today at 4pm, and palliative care may be able to join."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a corneal reflex in the left eye and gag reflex.   EEG shows
   moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly increasing brain
   function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or 'toxic-metabolic'
   changes). However, patient not arousable despite being off sedation,
   indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family meeting held yesterday and
   family has made patient DNR. They are awaiting a final family member
   from [**Country 249**] before making further decisions. Ortho spine recommends an
   MRI of c-spine prior to d/c c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to
   withdraw care
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to
   withdraw care
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a corneal reflex in the left eye and gag reflex.   EEG shows
   moderate to severe encephalopathy with slightly increasing brain
   function but signs of likely anoxic brain injury (or 'toxic-metabolic'
   changes). However, patient not arousable despite being off sedation,
   indicating poor neurologic prognosis. Family meeting held yesterday and

   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after suffering a cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury. He has a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient is currently on a ventilator with a PEEP of 14, PS of 5, and FiO2 of 50%. His blood pressure is 136/60 mmHg, heart rate is 81 bpm, and respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 94% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury, with a poor neurologic prognosis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure, with a PEEP of 14 and PS of 5.
3. Fever and leukocytosis, with a temperature of 100.7-100.8°C and a WBC of 12.9.
4. Oliguric renal failure, with a creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL and a UOP of 20-30 cc/hr.
5. Liver injury, with elevated LFTs and a trend towards normalization.
6. Rhythm disturbances, with atrial fibrillation and a history of coumadin use.

The patient is currently on a number of medications, including:

1. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone for suspected sepsis.
2. Morphine for pain management.
3. Insulin for glycemic control.
4. Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. Heparin for anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further decline in neurologic function.
2. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Sepsis or septic shock.
4. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal failure.
5. Liver failure or worsening liver injury.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
7. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's family has made him DNR, and the medical team is awaiting a final family member from [Country 249] before making further decisions. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and the medical team is working to optimize his care and manage his medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day
   1:[**1-19**]).  Level stable even though pt did not get a dose of vanc
   yesterday.  Will hold off on giving another dose today, will re-check
   level tomorrow
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for sepsis, oliguric renal failure, liver injury, and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's condition is complex and critical, with multiple potential complications. He has a poor neurologic prognosis, with a gag reflex but no arousal. He is on a ventilator and has a fever, which has been treated with antibiotics. His renal function is deteriorating, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL. He has liver injury, with a trend towards improving liver function tests. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not being anticoagulated due to his poor overall prognosis and mediastinal hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate sepsis. He has been treated with antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled.
2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate worsening renal function. He has a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease, which may contribute to his renal failure.
3. Liver Injury: The patient has liver injury, which may be secondary to shock liver or other factors. His liver function tests are trending down, which may indicate improving liver function.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on a ventilator and has a fever, which may indicate hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, which may contribute to his respiratory failure.
5. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has anoxic brain injury, which may be secondary to his cardiac arrest. He has a poor neurologic prognosis, with a gag reflex but no arousal.
6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which may have contributed to his anoxic brain injury and other complications.
7. Medastinal Hematoma: The patient has a mediastinal hematoma, which may be secondary to his cardiac arrest or other factors. This may increase his risk of bleeding and other complications.

In summary, the patient has a complex and critical condition, with multiple potential complications. He requires close monitoring and management to address his sepsis, oliguric renal failure, liver injury, hypoxic respiratory failure, anoxic brain injury, cardiac arrest, and mediastinal hematoma."

   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: pending family meeting today at 4pm<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for hypoxic respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/60 mmHg.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which was terminated early due to bradycardia. He has also had anoxic brain injury, which is likely to have a poor neurologic prognosis. His EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with signs of anoxic brain injury.

The patient has multiple organ dysfunction, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and congestive heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
3. Renal failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a urine output of 20-30 cc/hr.
4. Liver injury: The patient has evidence of liver injury, with an elevated INR and PTT.
5. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.9 x 10^9/L.
6. Bloodstream infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
7. Neurological injury: The patient has anoxic brain injury, which is likely to have a poor neurologic prognosis.

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

1. Antimicrobial therapy: The patient is receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone for the treatment of bloodstream infection.
2. Sedation: The patient is receiving sedation to manage his agitation and discomfort.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiovascular medications: The patient is receiving medications to manage his cardiac failure, including ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.
5. Insulin: The patient is receiving insulin to manage his hyperglycemia.

The patient's family has made him DNR (do not resuscitate), and they are awaiting a final family member from abroad before making further decisions. The patient's prognosis is poor, and his condition is likely to deteriorate further.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bloodstream infection and leukocytosis increase his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric renal failure and elevated creatinine level increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver injury and elevated INR and PTT increase his risk of developing liver failure.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac failure and history of cardiac arrest increase his risk of developing cardiac arrest.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day 1:[**1-19**])
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to
   withdraw care
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - start anticoagulation (heparin), will stop if family decides to
   withdraw care
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - start anticoagulation (heparin) today given INR is only 1.6, will
   stop if family decides to withdraw care
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone

   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew

   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - family meeting today at 4pm today, Palliative care may be able to
   join
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - goal HR 60s and MAP 55
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue Vancomycin and ceftriaxone
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   - continue Ceftriaxone (day 1: [**1-17**])
   - continue Vancomycin, dosed by level given renal failure (day
   1:[**1-19**]).  Level stable even though pt did not get a dose of vanc
   yesterday.  Will hold off on giving another dose today, will re-check
   level tomorrow
   - f/u final sputum & blood culture sensitivities
   - f/u remaining blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC and fever curve
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - f/u renal recs prn
   - continue to trend Creatinine and electrolytes for prognostication
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - continue to follow coags
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DM:
   - Glargine 20u qHS
   - Regular insulin sliding scale
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].
   - no IVF today
   - monitor respiratory status, wean the ventilator as tolerated
   - holding ACE and BB given hypotension and bradycardia

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest and has been receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, liver injury, and potential sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and recent chest CT scan showing mild pulmonary edema, there is a high risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's recent blood cultures grew out coag-neg staph, and his WBC count is elevated, indicating a potential septic process.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and his urine output is decreasing, suggesting ongoing oliguric renal failure.
4. Liver injury: The patient's LFTs are trending down, but his INR and PTT are still elevated, indicating ongoing liver injury.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk for developing further cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of electrolyte imbalances.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest CT scan shows mild pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to his hypoxemic respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent blood cultures grew out coag-neg staph, and his WBC count is elevated, indicating a potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Meningitis: The patient's recent blood cultures grew out coag-neg staph, and his WBC count is elevated, indicating a potential risk of meningitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and wean the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and vasopressors.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's liver injury with supportive care and monitor for signs of worsening liver function.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider antiarrhythmic medications if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
7. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis.
8. Continue to educate the family about the patient's condition and prognosis, and involve them in decision-making regarding further care."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   PLAN FOR [**2117-1-23**]
   At 10am, pt will be extubated and made CMO at 10 am. We will not
   escalate care with regards to blood pressure and fever.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - CMO today
   - morphine drip if uncomfortable
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   -d/c abx today
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - cmo today
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   .
   #. DM:
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented to the ICU after cardiac arrest. He has a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He has been on various medications, including anticoagulation therapy. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, hypoxia, and fever, and has undergone several interventions, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and cardiac rhythm management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest/Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's cardiac arrest may have resulted in anoxic brain injury, which can lead to poor neurologic prognosis and potential for brain death.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be indicative of an underlying infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and worsen the patient's condition.
4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential kidney damage.
5. Liver Injury: The patient's liver injury may worsen if not managed properly, leading to potential liver failure and worsening of other systemic complications.
6. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and potential for rhythm disturbances may worsen if not managed properly, leading to potential cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
7. Diabetic Complications: The patient's diabetes may worsen if not managed properly, leading to potential diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, and other complications.
8. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further cardiac decompensation and potential heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further rhythm disturbances.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further hypoxia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and leukocytosis and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further infection.
4. Continue to manage the patient's oliguric renal failure with dialysis and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver injury and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further liver damage.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's diabetic status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's congestive heart failure and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further cardiac decompensation.

It is recommended that the patient be extubated and allowed to follow a natural course, with close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm, respiratory status, and other systemic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   PLAN FOR [**2117-1-23**]
   At 10am, pt will be extubated and made CMO at 10 am. We will not
   escalate care with regards to blood pressure and fever.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - CMO today
   - morphine drip if uncomfortable
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   -d/c abx today
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - cmo today
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   .
   #. DM:
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   PLAN FOR [**2117-1-23**]
   At 10am, pt will be extubated and made CMO at 10 am. We will not
   escalate care with regards to blood pressure and fever.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - CMO today
   - morphine drip if uncomfortable
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79yo M w/hx of CAD s/p MI X 2, CHF, DM, Stage IV CKD who presents s/p
   cardiac arrest.
   PLAN FOR [**2117-1-23**]
   At 10am, pt will be extubated and made CMO at 10 am. We will not
   escalate care with regards to blood pressure and fever.
   .
   #. CARDIAC ARREST / ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY:  Patient sustained cardiac
   arrest s/p arctic sun terminated early for bradycardia.  Etiology
   includes VT/Vfib secondary to hyperkalemia from renal failure, scar
   tissue from prior infarction vs. new ischemic event.  He was on cooling
   protocol with Arctic Sun for 6 hours which had to be aborted because of
   bradycardia to 20s, which improved on dopamine and isoproterenol.
   Amiodarone was discontinued on [**1-17**].  Isoproterenol discontinued on
   [**1-18**], Dopamine discontinued [**1-20**]. All lines save for a PIV were pulled
   on [**1-21**].  In terms of neurologic function, patient had no brain stem
   reflex except for overbreathing on the vent on [**1-18**], but currently does
   have a gag reflex.   EEG shows moderate to severe encephalopathy with
   slightly increasing brain function but signs of likely anoxic brain
   injury (or 'toxic-metabolic' changes). However, patient not arousable
   despite being off sedation, indicating poor neurologic prognosis.
   Family meeting held yesterday and family has made patient DNR. They are
   awaiting a final family member from [**Country 249**] before making further
   decisions. Ortho spine recommends an MRI of c-spine prior to d/c
   c-collar.
   - CMO today
   - morphine drip if uncomfortable
   .
   #. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt currently on ventilator, s/p cardiac
   arrest.  Lung exam rhonchrous, chest CT with mild pulmonary edema.
   CXR clear.  On pressure support, requiring PEEP 14, PS 5, and FiO2 of
   50%.  The most likely mechanism of hypoxia is V/Q mismatch from
   pulmonary edema (now resoloved on CXR), atelectasis and mediastinal
   hematoma.  ABG reveals respiratory alkalosis with metabolic
   compensation, and respiratory alkalosis is secondary to patient
   overbreathing on the vent (RR 22-36).  Morphine was given to see if it
   can decrease RR, but RR continued to be high, suggesting that either
   pain was not particularly responsible for the tachypnea, or higher dose
   morphine is required.
   .
   #. FEVER AND LEUKOCYTOSIS: Patient spiked a fever to 102 on [**1-18**], now
   improved but still elevated at 100.7-100.8.  WBC stable.  Patient had
   grossly infected UA, but negative urine culture.  Sputum culture grew
   out Moraxella. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity/consolidation. Final
   aerobic & anaerobic blood culture from [**2117-1-16**] and [**1-18**] positive for
   coag neg staph. A-line and central lines pulled on [**1-20**].
   -d/c abx today
   .
   #. OLIGURIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine is trending up, 4.5 today. UOP
   now ~ 20-30 cc/hr.  K 4.7, normal but up from 4.2 yesterday.  Etiology
   for renal failure is likely ATN s/p shock and poor perfusion. FeNa >1%.
   No CVVH since [**1-18**], HD line pulled.
   - cmo today
   .
   #. LIVER INJURY: Patient sustained shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, but currently LFT
s are trending down, INR and PTT are
   also trending down.
   - no anticoagulation given poor overall prognosis and mediastinal
   hematoma
   .
   #. RHYTHM:  Patient with history of Afib, was on coumadin prior to
   admission.
   .
   #. DM:
   .
   #. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: EF of 30-35% on repeat TTE on [**1-18**].

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest, anoxic brain injury, and multiple comorbidities. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Support: The patient is on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 350 mL, pressure support of 5 cmH2O, and a PEEP of 14 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on FiO2 of 65%.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and a history of cardiac arrest, with a creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL and a potassium level of 4.7 mmol/L. The patient has a poor neurologic prognosis and is not arousable despite being off sedation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure with a creatinine of 4.5 mg/dL and a urine output of 20-30 cc/hr. The patient has a FeNa >1% and is not receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
4. Liver Injury: The patient has liver injury with elevated liver enzymes (ALT 1552 IU/L, AST 741 IU/L) and an INR of 1.6. The patient is not receiving anticoagulation therapy due to poor overall prognosis and mediastinal hematoma.
5. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has a fever of 103.2°F and leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.9 x 10^9/L. The patient has a grossly infected urine culture and a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.
6. Neurologic: The patient has a poor neurologic prognosis with a moderate to severe encephalopathy and signs of likely anoxic brain injury. The patient is not arousable despite being off sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on ventilator support, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if the patient's oxygenation and ventilation requirements are not met.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation and a history of cardiac arrest, which increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure progression: The patient has oliguric renal failure, and there is a risk of the condition progressing to anuria or requiring dialysis.
5. Liver failure: The patient has liver injury, and there is a risk of the condition progressing to liver failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
7. Neurologic deterioration: The patient has a poor neurologic prognosis, and there is a risk of the condition deteriorating further.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the plan for the next 24 hours is to:

1. Continue ventilator support with pressure support of 5 cmH2O and a PEEP of 14 cmH2O.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation requirements closely and adjust the ventilator settings as necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's fever and leukocytosis with antipyretics and antibiotics as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the fluid management and diuretic therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and INR and adjust the anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust the sedation and analgesia therapy as necessary.
7. Consider the possibility of extubation and discontinuation of sedation and analgesia therapy at 10 am."
