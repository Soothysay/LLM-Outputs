   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD
   on home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   concerning for pneumonia in setting of leukocytosis and bandemia.  As
   the patient has no recent hospitalizations and comes from home, was
   treated initially for CAP with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, which was
   converted to levofloxacin and clindamycin for CAP and aspiration
   coverage.  Patient is at aspiration risk given history of esophageal
   stricture.  No wheezing on exam concerning for COPD exacerbation, and
   patient does not have signs of volume overload.
   - Continue levofloxacin. Would favor holding clindamycin and following
   patient clinically, if decompensates would agree with covering for
   anaerobic.
   - Continue inhalers
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2 >88%. Baseline O2
   requirement of 2L nc.
   - F/u culture data
   - Speech and swallow study when stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis, tachycardia: Likely secondary to pulmonary infection
   with SIRS physiology.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - IVF as necessary
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Lactate this AM 1 from 3.3 on initial presentation
   after volume rescucitation. Likely in the setting of sepsis as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine of 0.6.  In setting of
   sepsis and decreased effective intravascular volume, likely renal
   hypoperfusion. Urine Na <10, suggestiving volume depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - IVF as necessary.
   - Trend UOP.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: In the setting of renal failure with normal EKG
   and asymptomology.
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications. Would favor judicious use given current
   pulmonary process and concern for lowering respiratory drive with
   benzodiazepines.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine. Will hold Ativan for now
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Hct trended down overnight and the patient received
   1 unit PRBC.
   - Trend hct and transfuse for hct<21 or signs of end organ damage.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Iron studies.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and a recent fall. She was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg. She is receiving supplemental oxygen and has a SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.1 K/uL
* Anemia with a Hct of 18.6%
* Elevated troponin levels of 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L
* Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL
* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) with a total bilirubin level of 27 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased peripheral pulses. She is not assessed for skin, neurologic, or respiratory examination.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, GERD, and a history of esophageal stricture, which increases her risk of aspiration. She is also taking several medications, including inhalers, antibiotics, and antidepressants.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continuing antibiotics for pneumonia
* Weaning supplemental oxygen as tolerated
* Trending WBC and fever curve
* IVF as necessary
* Monitoring creatinine and UOP
* Cycling enzymes
* Monitoring on telemetry
* Continuing ASA
* Judicious use of benzodiazepines
* Trending Hct and transfusing for Hct <21 or signs of end-organ damage
* Maintaining active T+S
* Iron studies

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Lactic acidosis
* Aspiration
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Anemia
* Iron deficiency
* Vitamin deficiencies

Based on the patient's laboratory results and medical history, it is recommended to continue antibiotics, IVF as necessary, and monitor creatinine and UOP. The patient's anemia and iron deficiency should be addressed, and the patient should be evaluated for potential vitamin deficiencies. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and supplemental oxygen should be weaned as tolerated."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia. Given positive blood cultures, likely
   pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with resulting bacteremia, although
   S.aureus cannot be ruled out at this time.  No wheezing on exam
   concerning for COPD exacerbation and patient does not have signs of
   volume overload.
   - Vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  Plan to narrow coverage when
   culture data returns.
   - Hold clindamycin and follow patient clinically, if decompensates
   would consider expanding coverage for anaerobes.
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM trending
   down. Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Hct trended down overnight and the patient received
   1 unit PRBC.
   - Trend hct Q12H and transfuse for hct<21 or signs of end organ damage.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Iron studies.
   - Restart supplemental ferrous sulfate
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine of 0.6 with Creatinine that
   has normalized.  In setting of sepsis and decreased effective
   intravascular volume, likely renal hypoperfusion. Urine Na <10,
   suggestiving volume depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Trend UOP.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Unchanged ECG. CK flat with TnT of 0.03 from 0.05
   this AM.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID prn for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU for fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. She has a history of COPD, GERD, and iron deficiency anemia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, and her condition has been stabilized. However, she remains tachycardic and has leukocytosis, which is trending down. Her hemodynamics are stable, and her lactate levels are normal. She has received 1 unit of PRBC for anemia and is being transfused for a hematocrit <21 or signs of end-organ damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures and likely pneumococcal lobar pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and has leukocytosis, which is a sign of sepsis. She may develop organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine of 0.6, which has normalized, but she may still develop acute renal failure due to sepsis and decreased effective intravascular volume.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, and her hematocrit has trended down overnight. She may require further transfusions and iron supplementation to manage her anemia.
5. Anxiety/Depression: The patient has significant anxiety and depression, which may require further management and treatment.
6. S/P Falls: The patient has a history of falls, which may be multifactorial and require further evaluation and management.
7. Elevated Troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, which may be due to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and baseline anemia.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and may require prophylactic anticoagulation.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her critical illness and may require prophylaxis.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to her intubation and may require prophylaxis.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia. Given positive blood cultures, likely
   pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with resulting bacteremia, although
   S.aureus cannot be ruled out at this time.  No wheezing on exam
   concerning for COPD exacerbation and patient does not have signs of
   volume overload. Patinet spiked to 101 overnight and was re-cultured.
   Currently on 50% shovel mask and 6L nc.
   - Vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  Plan to narrow coverage when
   culture data returns.
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM stable.
   Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after volume
   rescucitation.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   - Goal TBB even to -500 today.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from

   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID prn for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU for fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. She has a significant medical history, including COPD, GERD, and iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/64 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a face tent and has a SpO2 of 95%. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery at 6L nc.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 23.9 K/uL, and her blood cultures are positive for GPC in pairs and chains. Her troponin-T level is 0.03 ng/mL, and her CK/CKMB levels are normal. Her lactate level is 1.0 mmol/L, and her albumin level is 2.4 g/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and leukocytosis suggest ongoing sepsis, which may require further antimicrobial therapy and close monitoring.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is multifocal and may require additional antibiotic coverage. The patient's partial right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis may also require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's resolved acute renal failure may require continued close monitoring of her creatinine and UOP levels.
4. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia may require continued treatment with ferrous sulfate and consideration of outpatient colonoscopy.
5. Anxiety/Depression: The patient's significant anxiety and depression may require continued treatment with benzodiazepines and antidepressants.
6. S/P Falls: The patient's multifactorial fall may require further evaluation and treatment, including physical therapy and consideration of return to independent living.
7. Elevated Troponins: The patient's elevated troponin levels may require further evaluation and treatment, including close monitoring on telemetry and consideration of additional cardiovascular medications.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a significant medical history and several potential medical complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, acute renal failure, anemia, anxiety/depression, S/P falls, and elevated troponins."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia. Given positive blood cultures, likely
   pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with resulting bacteremia, although
   S.aureus cannot be ruled out at this time.  No wheezing on exam
   concerning for COPD exacerbation and patient does not have signs of
   volume overload. Patinet spiked to 101 overnight and was re-cultured.
   Currently on 50% shovel mask and 6L nc.
   - Vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  Plan to narrow coverage when
   culture data returns.
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM stable.
   Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after volume
   rescucitation.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   - Goal TBB even to -500 today.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from

   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Heart rate: 112 bpm
* Blood pressure: 114/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* SpO2: 95%

The patient has a history of COPD, GERD, and iron deficiency anemia. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone, and is currently on 50% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.1 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 439 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest: multifocal pneumonia without evidence of cavitation, partial right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which is a potential complication of her underlying COPD and GERD.
* Sepsis: The patient's temperature has spiked to 101.1°F, and she has a leukocytosis, which may indicate sepsis.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, and her current hemoglobin level is 7.9 g/dL.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, which may indicate acute renal failure.
* Elevated troponins: The patient's troponin-T level is 0.05 ng/mL, which may indicate cardiac damage or demand ischemia.
* Anxiety/depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and is currently taking multiple medications for these conditions.
* S/P falls: The patient has a history of falls, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or medication use.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.
* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive oxygen therapy and breathing treatments.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamic status will be closely monitored, and she will receive fluids as necessary.
* Laboratory monitoring: The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored, and she will receive blood products as necessary.
* Imaging studies: The patient will receive additional imaging studies, including a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, to assess her respiratory and gastrointestinal status.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a diagnosis of pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia, who is being treated with antibiotics and respiratory support. She has a history of falls and anxiety/depression, and is at risk for acute renal failure and cardiac damage."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia. Given positive blood cultures, likely
   pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with resulting bacteremia, although
   S.aureus cannot be ruled out at this time.  No wheezing on exam
   concerning for COPD exacerbation and patient does not have signs of
   volume overload. Patinet spiked to 101 overnight and was re-cultured.
   Currently on 50% shovel mask and 6L nc.
   - Vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  Plan to narrow coverage when
   culture data returns.
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM stable.
   Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after volume
   rescucitation.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   - Goal TBB even to -500 today.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

	+ Fever spike to 101.1°F overnight, which was re-cultured.
	+ Multi-focal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural effusions on CT chest.
	+ Tachycardia, leukocytosis, and elevated troponins.
	+ Anemia, which is likely exacerbated by sepsis.
	+ Acute renal failure, which has resolved with fluid challenge.
	+ Anxiety and depression, with a history of significant benzo requirement.
	+ History of falls, with multifactorial causes including decreased vision, non-compliance with walker, and acutely worsened in the setting of brewing infection.
* The patient is currently on the following medications:
	+ Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone for pneumonia.
	+ Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
	+ Aspirin for cardioprotection.
	+ Ativan for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
	+ Celexa, Quetiapine, and Duloxetine for depression.
* The patient's vital signs are:
	+ Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C) with a current temperature of 97.7°F (36.5°C).
	+ Heart rate: 112 beats per minute.
	+ Blood pressure: 114/64 mmHg.
	+ Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute.
	+ Oxygen saturation: 95%.
* The patient's laboratory results show:
	+ White blood cell count: 23.9 K/uL.
	+ Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL.
	+ Platelet count: 439 K/uL.
	+ Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL.
	+ Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL.
	+ Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L.
* The patient's imaging studies show:
	+ CT chest: multi-focal pneumonia without evidence of cavitation, partial right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or other complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, cardiac failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
3. Anemia exacerbation: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, bone marrow suppression, or other factors.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may recur or worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponins may indicate cardiac damage, which could lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, or other complications.
6. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen, leading to decreased quality of life, increased morbidity, or suicidal ideation.
7. Falls: The patient's history of falls may increase her risk of future falls, which could lead to further injury or complications.
8. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of her body, leading to sepsis, organ dysfunction, or death."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia with blood cultures speciated as S.pneumoniae
   with sensitivities pending.  Oxygen requirement improving now on 6L nc.
   - Continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities. Plan to
   narrow coverage to ceftriaxone (Legionella urinary antigen negative) if
   cephalosporin sensitive.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   - Speech and swallow eval
   - Goal TBB even to -500 for day
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM
   stable. Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after
   volume rescucitation.  Persistent tachycardia in setting of severe
   multi-lobar pneumonia likely related to infection, although other
   potential etiologies include pain, hyperthyroid, and benzo withdrawal.
   - Antimicrobials as above
   - Oxycodone for pain
   - Ativan standing and PRN for benzo withdrawal.
   - Check TSH
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%. Hct this AM 23.2 from 25 yesterday PM.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU for fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. She has a history of COPD, GERD, and iron deficiency anemia. Her current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic (116 bpm), blood pressure 134/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on nasal cannula.
* Laboratory results: Leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated troponins.
* Radiology: Right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia.
* Physical examination: Dullness to percussion at the right base, rhonchorous throughout, and no signs of congestive heart failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement is improving, but she is still on 6L of nasal cannula oxygen. She may require further weaning of supplemental oxygen.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia is still active, and there is a risk of further progression and potential complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not well-controlled, and she may require further management with iron supplements and consideration of blood transfusions.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponins may indicate cardiac damage, and she may require further monitoring and management.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are within normal limits, but there is a risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to her underlying medical conditions.
6. Anxiety and depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and she may require further management with medication and therapy.
7. Falls: The patient's fall may have been multifactorial, and she may require further evaluation and management to prevent future falls.
8. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may be secondary to an underlying infection, and she may require further evaluation and management to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize her respiratory, cardiac, and renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia with blood cultures speciated as S.pneumoniae
   with sensitivities pending.  Oxygen requirement improving now on 6L nc.
   - Continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities. Plan to
   narrow coverage to ceftriaxone (Legionella urinary antigen negative) if
   cephalosporin sensitive.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   .
   # Sepsis/tachycardia: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM
   stable. Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after
   volume rescucitation.  Persistent tachycardia in setting of severe
   multi-lobar pneumonia likely related to infection. Low suspicion for
   PE.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   - Goal TBB even to -500 today.
   - Check TSH
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%. Hct this AM 23.2 from 25 yesterday PM.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy

   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and iron deficiency anemia. She was admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. The patient has developed several complications during her ICU stay.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. However, she remains tachycardic, which is likely related to her infection.

The patient has developed anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 23.2 g/dL. She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and has received one unit of packed red blood cells during her hospital stay. The patient's ferritin level is 3%, which is low, and her TIBC is 3%. The patient is being treated with ferrous sulfate and is scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy.

The patient has also developed acute renal failure, which has resolved with fluid challenge. Her creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and her urine output is stable.

The patient has elevated troponin levels, which are likely related to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and baseline anemia. She is being monitored on telemetry and is receiving aspirin.

The patient has a history of falls and has been found to have decreased vision and non-compliance with her walker. She is at risk for further falls and may not be safe to return to independent living.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) put her at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin levels put her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease put her at risk for further renal failure.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia and iron deficiency put her at risk for further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
* Infection: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis put her at risk for further infection and septic shock.
* Falls: The patient's history of falls and decreased vision put her at risk for further falls and injuries.
* Depression and anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety put her at risk for further psychological complications, such as suicidal ideation and panic attacks.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and provide optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia with blood cultures speciated with
   pneumococcus.  Oxygen requirement stable at 6L nc.
   - Continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities. Plan to
   narrow coverage to ceftriaxone (Legionella urinary antigen negative) if
   cephalosporin sensitive.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   - Speech and swallow eval
   - Goal TBB even to -500 for day
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient remains tachycardic although trending down
   slightly. Leukocytosis this AM stable. Persistent tachycardia in
   setting of severe multi-lobar pneumonia likely related to infection,
   although other potential etiologies include pain,benzo withdrawal, and
   anemia. Low suspicion for PE, and hyperthyroid unlikely given TSH.
   - Antimicrobials as above
   - Oxycodone for pain
   - Ativan standing and PRN for benzo withdrawal.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC and assess for improvement in oxygenation and
   tachycardia.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 22.2 from 23.2 yesterday.
   - As above, transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Psych: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging by various
   medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement concerning for
   withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a significant medical history, including COPD, GERD, and a recent fall. She was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardia trending down to 100-110s, Tmax 38.2°C, Tcurrent 37.3°C, HR 116 bpm, BP 128/75 mmHg, RR 25 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving fluid therapy, with a total input of 730 mL and a total output of 1080 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of -350 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula, with an ABG reading of 30/30/30.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 20.1, Hct is 22.2%, and Plt is 402 K/uL. The patient's Cr is 1.0 mg/dL, TCO2 is 25 mmHg, and Glucose is 85 mg/dL.
* Assessment and plan:
	+ The patient has right-sided infiltrates on her CXR consistent with pneumonia, and her oxygen requirement is stable at 6L nc.
	+ She is receiving levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities, with a plan to narrow coverage to ceftriaxone if cephalosporin-sensitive.
	+ The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which is likely related to infection, although other potential etiologies include pain, benzo withdrawal, and anemia.
	+ She is receiving antimicrobials, oxycodone for pain, and Ativan standing and PRN for benzo withdrawal.
	+ The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit trending down to 22.2% from 23.2% yesterday.
	+ She is receiving 1 unit of PRBC and is being assessed for improvement in oxygenation and tachycardia.
	+ The patient has significant anxiety and benzo withdrawal symptoms, and is receiving multiple medications to manage these symptoms.
	+ She has elevated troponins, which are likely related to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis with baseline anemia.
	+ The patient has a history of falls, which appears to be multifactorial, and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of pneumonia and respiratory failure
* Development of septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Progression of anemia and potential need for further transfusions
* Continued tachycardia and potential development of cardiac arrhythmias
* Benzo withdrawal symptoms and potential for increased anxiety and agitation
* Increased risk of DVT and PE due to immobility and underlying medical conditions
* Potential for further falls and injury due to decreased vision and cognitive impairment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia with blood cultures speciated with
   pneumococcus.  Oxygen requirement stable at 6L nc.
   - Continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities. Plan to
   narrow coverage to ceftriaxone (Legionella urinary antigen negative) if
   3^rd generation cephalosporin sensitive.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   - Speech and swallow eval
   - Goal TBB even to -500 for day
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient remains tachycardic although trending down
   slightly. Leukocytosis this AM stable. Persistent tachycardia in
   setting of severe multi-lobar pneumonia likely related to infection,
   although other potential etiologies include pain,benzo withdrawal, and
   anemia. Low suspicion for PE, and hyperthyroid unlikely given TSH.
   - Antimicrobials as above
   - Oxycodone for pain
   - Ativan standing and PRN for benzo withdrawal.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC and assess for improvement in oxygenation and
   tachycardia.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 22.2 from 23.2 yesterday.  Guaiac
   negative.
   - As above, transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Psych: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging by various
   medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement concerning for
   withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. The patient has a significant medical history, including COPD, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name**]. The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided infiltrates on CXR, consistent with pneumonia, and blood cultures are speciated with pneumococcus. The patient is receiving levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities.
2. Tachycardia: The patient remains tachycardic, trending down slightly, with a heart rate of 116 bpm. The tachycardia is likely related to infection, but other potential etiologies include pain, benzodiazepine withdrawal, and anemia.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is trending down to 22.2 from 23.2 yesterday. The patient has received 1 unit of PRBC and is being transfused again.
4. Psychiatric issues: The patient has significant anxiety and is receiving multiple medications, including Celexa, Quetiapine, and Duloxetine. The patient is also at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has resolved with fluid challenge.
6. Elevated troponins: The patient's troponin levels have decreased, and the ECG is unchanged. The elevated troponins are likely related to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis with baseline anemia.
7. S/P Falls: The patient has fallen and is at risk for further falls due to decreased vision, non-compliance with walker use, and oxygen tubing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and anemia suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and tachycardia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponins increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine has resolved, but ongoing sepsis and hypovolemia can lead to further renal impairment.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if not properly treated, leading to further complications.
6. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient's benzodiazepine use and withdrawal symptoms increase the risk of withdrawal syndrome.
7. Falls: The patient's risk of falls is increased due to decreased vision, non-compliance with walker use, and oxygen tubing.

In summary, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a complex medical condition, including pneumonia, tachycardia, anemia, and psychiatric issues. The patient is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, anemia, benzodiazepine withdrawal, and falls."
