You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] and is currently in the ICU for management of acute hypoxemia and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 100-112 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/79 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and she is receiving oxygen therapy at 6L.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to immobility and recent surgery. She has a large saddle embolus and right ventricular strain, which is pre-load dependent.

The patient's laboratory results show mild hyperglycemia, and her urine output has been low despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Her urine chemistry is concerning, with a specific gravity of >1.050, pH of 6.5, and presence of RBCs (>1000).

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of immobility and recent surgery puts her at risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism.
2. Right ventricular strain: The patient's right ventricular strain is pre-load dependent, and she may require further fluid resuscitation to improve her hemodynamics.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's mild hyperglycemia may require further management to prevent complications.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's low urine output and presence of RBCs in her urine may indicate a urinary tract infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary embolism may put her at risk for respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Heparin infusion to maintain a goal PTT of 60-100.
2. Monitoring with telemetry and arterial line.
3. Follow-up with cardiac surgery and thoracic recommendations.
4. Management of COPD with Advair, tiotroprium, and Albuterol.
5. Pain control with oxycodone.
6. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 250mL/hr, with plans to decrease to 125mL/hr after the first liter.
7. Re-evaluation in the morning to assess the patient's response to treatment.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehab, with a diagnosis of large saddle emboli and RV strain.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* HR: 100-112 bpm
* BP: 120/79-93 mmHg
* RR: 26 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has a history of COPD, and her respiratory support includes oxygen therapy with an aerosol-cool delivery device. Her physical examination is notable for tachycardia, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallop, and shallow chest expansion with tachypnea.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hct: 35.6%
* TropT: 0.05
* TCO2: 27
* PT/PTT/INR: 17.0/150.0/1.5
* CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 26//0.05
* Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pulmonary Embolism: Currently hemodynamically stable with a systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg and a heart rate in the low 100s. The etiology could be immobility with recent surgery and rehab versus a hypercoagulable state from a family history with a father having a clot.
* RV Strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA. Given the patient's current hemodynamics, she is very preload-dependent.
* COPD: Significant underlying disease likely contributing to overall pulmonary compromise.
* s/p Thoracotomy, resection, and tracheo/bronchoplasty: Per thoracic surgery, TPA is fine despite recent surgery if hemodynamic compromise.
* Recent N/V,?D: Recent illness with no leukocytosis or fever on presentation. Could consider sending for stool C. diff if loose stools.
* OSA: On CPAP at rehab.
* Hyperglycemia: Continue FS QID and ISS.

The patient's plan includes:

* Heparin gtt for goal PTT 60-100
* Echo to evaluate RH function
* Telemetry
* Place A-line for HD compromise
* Repeat ABG
* Follow-up cardiac surgery/thoracics recommendations
* Hold TPA unless e/o HD compromise such as SBP < 90, HR > 120, hypoxia not fixed by supplemental O2 alone
* Continue COPD treatment: Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN, and steroid taper
* Oxycodone for pain relief
* Give NS x 1L and reevaluate for further fluid
* If acute decompensation, consider TPA and continue IVF
* Continue steroid taper with ISS
* Follow-up thoracic and cardiac surgery recommendations
* Pain control with bowel regimen

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Pulmonary Embolism: Further embolization or progression to chronic pulmonary hypertension
* RV Strain: Acute decompensation or chronic RV failure
* COPD: Exacerbation of COPD or chronic respiratory failure
* s/p Thoracotomy, resection, and tracheo/bronchoplasty: Wound complications, pneumonia, or respiratory failure
* Recent N/V,?D: Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or secondary infection
* OSA: Respiratory failure or cardiac arrhythmias
* Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-cardiovascular surgery patient who underwent thrombolytic therapy, which was deferred. The patient's urine output has been low despite receiving 2.5 liters of fluids. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 100-112 bpm
* Blood pressure: 120/79 mmHg (93-120/79 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Distressed, difficulty speaking
* Head and neck: Normal, mildly dry mucous membranes
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops
* Chest: Well-healing incision, symmetric expansion with tachypnea
* Abdomen: Active bowel sounds, obese, without tenderness or masses
* Extremities: Warm and pink, 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally, without erythema or warmth
* Neurological: Non-focal, moving all limbs equally, speaking coherently in short sentences

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 35.6%
* Troponin-T: 0.05
* TCO2: 27
* PT/PTT/INR: 17.0/150.0/1.5
* CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 26//0.05
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium: 1,300 units/hour
* Other ICU medications: Not specified

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to low urine output and fluid overload.
2. Cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure due to tachypnea and shallow expansion.
4. Sepsis or septic shock due to potential infection.
5. Coagulopathy or bleeding complications due to thrombolytic therapy and heparin administration.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia, due to low TCO2 levels.
7. Lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism.

Given the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor their vital signs, urine output, and laboratory results closely to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pulmonary emboli (""saddle"")
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to actue pulmonary embolism, on
   background of COPD and partial RUL resection.  Treat PE, continue COPD
   medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ""saddle"" by CT angio;  therapeutic on iv
   Heparin.  Evidence for RV strain by echo in ER --> repeat formal study
   to assess RV function (may have underlying pulmonary hypertension
   related to COPD).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to extensive pulmonary embolism.  Continue
   supplimentall oxygen --> maintain >90%.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal; improved with iv fluids.  Monitor uo, BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic;  receiving iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   s/p RUL RESECTION, partial (wedge) -- no further plans.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be assessed:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, pulmonary embolism, and hypoxemia. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and had a partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection. The patient's condition has improved overnight, with reduced oxygen requirement and ability to speak more comfortably in sentences. However, they developed mild hematuria this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a saddle-shaped PE, which is a high-risk complication. There is a risk of further embolization, which can lead to cardiopulmonary arrest.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to the PE, COPD, and partial RUL resection. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to the PE. There is a risk of further hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure.
4. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria is prerenal and has improved with IV fluids. However, there is a risk of further prerenal azotemia, which can lead to acute kidney injury.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a hypovolemic fluid imbalance, which can lead to further complications such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of COPD and partial RUL resection increases their risk of gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration pneumonia, bowel obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of COPD and partial RUL resection increases their risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
8. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state increases their risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's ICU stay and respiratory distress increase their risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition.
10. Delirium: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase their risk of delirium, which can lead to cognitive impairment, increased length of stay, and increased risk of mortality.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team to prevent and treat any complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pulmonary emboli (""saddle"")
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to actue pulmonary embolism, on
   background of COPD and partial RUL resection.  Treat PE, continue COPD
   medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ""saddle"" by CT angio;  therapeutic on iv
   Heparin.  Evidence for RV strain by echo in ER --> repeat formal study
   to assess RV function (may have underlying pulmonary hypertension
   related to COPD).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to extensive pulmonary embolism.  Continue
   supplimentall oxygen --> maintain >90%.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal; improved with iv fluids.  Monitor uo, BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic;  receiving iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   s/p RUL RESECTION, partial (wedge) -- no further plans.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, respiratory distress, and oliguria. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's respiratory support includes aerosol-cool oxygen delivery, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 5.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 154 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection, and a history of pulmonary embolism. The patient's current condition is attributed to an acute pulmonary embolism, which is causing respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

The patient's plan of care includes treatment for the acute pulmonary embolism, continued COPD medications, and supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%. The patient's oliguria is attributed to prerenal factors and is being treated with intravenous fluids. The patient's fluid status is hypovolemic, and they are receiving intravenous fluids to correct this.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism may cause cardiac complications, such as right ventricular strain, which may lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria may worsen, leading to renal failure.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase the risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history and a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, respiratory distress, and oliguria. The patient's plan of care includes treatment for the acute pulmonary embolism, continued COPD medications, and supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%. The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, bleeding complications, infection, and gastrointestinal complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4, 2180. She presented with acute hypoxemia from rehab and was found to have large saddle emboli and RV strain. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for pulmonary embolism, RV strain, and COPD.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/71 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is being monitored with telemetry and an arterial line.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.8-7.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.7-11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 154-159 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05-0.06 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27 mmol/L
* Glucose: 110-149 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: The patient appears more comfortable than on presentation, able to speak in whole sentences, and has no abnormal findings.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a regular rhythm without murmurs or gallop.
* Chest: The patient has a well-healing incision, symmetric shallow expansion with tachypnea, and mildly rhonchorous bilateral anterior and posteriorly.
* Abdomen: The patient has no abnormal findings.
* Extremities: The patient has 2+ deep tendon pulses bilaterally, symmetric, and no erythema, warmth, or tenderness.
* Neurological: The patient has non-focal neurological examination, moving all limbs equally, speaking coherently in short sentences, and has grossly intact cranial nerves II-XII.

The patient's medical conditions and plan of care include:

* Pulmonary embolism: The patient is being treated with heparin infusion and is scheduled to receive coumadin bridge therapy.
* RV strain: The patient is being monitored for signs of fluid overload and is receiving fluid resuscitation as needed.
* COPD: The patient is being treated with COPD medications and is scheduled to receive steroid taper therapy.
* Recent N/V: The patient is being monitored for signs of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.
* OSA: The patient is being treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient is being treated with insulin sliding scale (ISS) therapy.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to her underlying COPD and RV strain.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and pulmonary embolism.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to her underlying RV strain and pulmonary embolism.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her recent surgery and potential C. diff infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and respiratory failure
* Adjusting fluid resuscitation and oxygen therapy as needed
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and sepsis
* Continuing COPD and pulmonary embolism treatment
* Continuing steroid taper therapy
* Monitoring for signs of C. diff infection and adjusting treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   59 yo F, s/p thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and
   tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] p/w acute hypoxemia from rehab, found
   to have large saddle emboli and e/o RV strain.
   .
   # Pulmonary Embolism: Currently HD stable with SBP > 100 and HR in low
   100s.  Patient with adequate O2 saturation on 6L but with increased
   WOB.  Etiology could be immobility with recent surgergy and rehab vs.
   hypercoaguable state from ?FH with father having [**Name2 (NI) **] clot.  With
   severe underlying COPD, will need to maximize pulmonary dynamics.
   - Heparin gtt for goal PTT 60-100
   - Follow up LENI and ECHO
   - Monitoring with Telemetry and A line
   - Follow-up cardiac surgery / thoracics recommendations
   - Hold TPA unless e/o HD compromise such as SBP < 90, HR > 120, hypoxia
   not fixed by supplemental O2 alone
   - Continue COPD treatment: Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN and
   steroid taper
   - Oxycodone for pain relief
   .
   # RV strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA.  Given current hemodynamics,
   is very pre-load dependent.  Does have 18g IV x 3.
   - Given FENa of 0, and BUN/Cr > 20 and a high urine specific gravity,
   we can be confident that patient requires fluid resuscitation.
   Currently running at 250mL/hr of NS, and will decrease to 125mL/hr
   after the first liter.
   - Re-evaluate in PM.
   - If acute decompensation, consider TPA and continue IVF
   .
   # COPD: Signficant underlying disease.  Likely contributing to overall
   pulmonary compromise with tacypnea not helpful given need to have
   prolonged expiration.
   - Continue COPD meds
   - Continue steroid taper, with ISS
   .
   # s/p Thoracotomy, resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty: Per Thoracic
   surgery, TPA fine despite recent surgery if HD compromise.
   - f/up Thoracic and Cardiac surgery recs
   - Pain control with bowel regimen
   .
   # Recent N/V, ?D: Recent illness. No leukocystosis or fever on
   presentation.  UA negative.  Could consider sending for stool C.diff if
   loose stools.
   - Monitor

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, which revealed large saddle emboli and RV strain.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg and a heart rate in the low 100s. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula, with a saturation of 100%. However, she is experiencing increased work of breathing.

The patient has a history of underlying COPD, which may be contributing to her pulmonary compromise. She is being treated with Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol, and is also receiving a steroid taper.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T, indicating potential inflammation and cardiac strain. Her renal function is also compromised, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a BUN/Cr ratio of 20.

The patient's current medical plan includes:

1. Heparin infusion to achieve a goal PTT of 60-100 seconds.
2. Monitoring with telemetry and arterial line.
3. Follow-up with cardiac surgery and thoracic recommendations.
4. Hold tPA unless there is evidence of hemodynamic compromise, such as a systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, a heart rate above 120 beats per minute, or hypoxia not corrected with supplemental oxygen.
5. Continue COPD treatment, including Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol.
6. Oxycodone for pain relief.
7. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline at a rate of 250 mL/hr, decreasing to 125 mL/hr after the first liter.
8. Re-evaluate in the morning.
9. If there is acute decompensation, consider tPA and continue IV fluids.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's current condition is stable, but there is a risk of further embolization or worsening of the current condition.
2. Cardiac strain: The patient's RV strain may worsen, leading to cardiac compromise.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's compromised renal function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's recent illness and potential for immobility may increase the risk of infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these potential complications and ensure her safe and effective care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of severe respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) with hemodynamically significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate hypokinesis, and severely dilated right ventricle. The patient has also developed acute renal failure (ARF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's lab results show hypokalemia, acute renal failure, and elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) progression: The patient's PE may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress, hypotension, and cardiac compromise.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) progression: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to increased fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of sepsis.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress, hypoxia, and increased risk of respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's immobility, invasive lines, and respiratory support may increase the risk of sepsis.
6. Cardiac compromise: The patient's hemodynamically significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and severely dilated right ventricle may lead to cardiac compromise, including heart failure and cardiac arrest.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and COPD exacerbation may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4, 2180. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, which revealed large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: Stable with a systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg and a heart rate in the 90-100 beats per minute range.
* Respiratory status: Adequate oxygen saturation on 6L nasal cannula, but with increased work of breathing.
* Cardiovascular status: Right ventricular strain with moderate hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, as evidenced by echocardiogram.
* Renal status: Low urine output, with an interval output of 15-40 mL/hour.
* Neurological status: Non-focal, moving all limbs equally, speaking coherently in short sentences, and with intact cranial nerves II-XII.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a large saddle emboli, which is a significant risk factor for pulmonary embolism. She is receiving heparin infusion to prevent further clotting.
* Right ventricular strain: The patient's right ventricle is severely dilated and hypokinetic, which can lead to right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock.
* Hypercoagulable state: The patient has a family history of clotting disorders, which may contribute to her hypercoagulable state.
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has significant underlying COPD, which can exacerbate her respiratory status.
* Fluid overload: The patient has a low urine output and is receiving fluids to resuscitate her. However, she may be at risk for fluid overload if her fluid intake is not carefully monitored.

To manage these potential complications, the patient is receiving the following treatments:

* Heparin infusion to prevent further clotting
* Oxygen therapy to maintain adequate oxygen saturation
* Bronchodilators to manage COPD
* Fluid resuscitation with normal saline
* Pain management with oxycodone
* Monitoring with telemetry and arterial line

The patient's plan is to continue her current treatments and monitor her condition closely for signs of deterioration. If she develops acute decompensation, she may require additional interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy or continued intravenous fluids."

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She was found to have large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain. She is currently in the ICU with acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, and her condition is stable with a systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg and a heart rate in the 90-100 beats per minute range. She has adequate oxygen saturation on 6L of oxygen but has increased work of breathing. Her etiology of pulmonary embolism is uncertain, but it may be related to immobility with recent surgery and rehabilitation or a hypercoagulable state from her family history.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's condition is stable, but there is a risk of further embolism or deterioration of her right ventricular function.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] and is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehab. She has been diagnosed with large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a SBP of 100-120 and HR in the 90-100s, but has increased WOB and requires maximal pulmonary dynamics due to severe underlying COPD. The patient has also been diagnosed with bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs) and is being treated with heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's condition is precarious, and there is a risk of further pulmonary embolism or deterioration of her respiratory status.
2. Right Ventricular Strain: The patient's right ventricle is severely dilated with moderate hypokinesis, which increases the risk of right ventricular failure and cardiac arrest.
3. Hypotension: The patient's SBP is currently within the normal range, but there is a risk of hypotension due to fluid loss, bleeding, or medication.
4. Hypercoagulability: The patient's history of DVTs and family history of clotting disorders may indicate a hypercoagulable state, which increases the risk of further thrombotic events.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may exacerbate due to her respiratory status, which can lead to further respiratory failure and increased risk of complications.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of fluid overload due to ongoing fluid administration and inadequate diuresis.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is elevated, which may indicate kidney damage or dysfunction, and there is a risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Infection: The patient's recent illness and lack of leukocystosis or fever on presentation may indicate a low-grade infection, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
9. Bleeding: The patient's recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and cardiac arrest.
10. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status is precarious, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest due to right ventricular failure, pulmonary embolism, or other cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxemia, and the note highlights several significant findings and concerns.

The patient has a pulmonary embolism, which is attributed to the saddle embolism. The patient is responding to therapy, and the plan is to maintain a PTT of 60-80 with Heparin and initiate Coumadin.

The patient also has evidence of right heart strain by echo, which will require follow-up echocardiogram in one week.

The patient has a history of COPD and is being managed with usual medications. However, the note suggests that the patient may require an increase in prednisone if they experience a COPD flare-up.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which has resolved, and will require monitoring of blood pressure.

The patient is also being managed for OSA with CPAP at night.

The note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia make them at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's saddle embolism is a significant concern, and the risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism is high.
3. Heart failure: The patient's evidence of right heart strain by echo and history of hypotension make them at risk for heart failure.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and requirement for increased prednisone if they experience a flare-up make them at risk for COPD exacerbation.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of hypotension make them at risk for infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of hypotension and requirement for anticoagulation therapy make them at risk for bleeding.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple comorbidities to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress attributed to a pulmonary embolism. This condition is a potential complication of immobility, and the patient's history of tracheobronchomalacia may have contributed to the development of this condition.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a saddle embolism, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. The patient is responding to therapy, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of right heart strain, which is a potential complication of pulmonary embolism. The patient will require follow-up to assess the condition at one week.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to prevent future episodes.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD, which is a chronic condition that can exacerbate respiratory distress. The patient's acute exacerbation is being managed with usual medications and increased prednisone if necessary.
6. Hypokalemia (Low Potassium): The patient has hypokalemia, which is a potential complication of respiratory distress and heart failure. Close monitoring of potassium levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient has acute renal failure, which is a potential complication of respiratory distress, heart failure, and hypotension. Close monitoring of kidney function is necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, which is a potential complication of chronic respiratory disease. This condition can increase the risk of respiratory distress and pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that may arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress can progress to respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation and close monitoring.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's heart failure and hypotension can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, which requires prompt treatment.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state can increase the risk of infection, which requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
5. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory distress and hypotension can increase the risk of sepsis, which requires prompt treatment.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is currently in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] and was readmitted with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). She has a history of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been treated with heparin and coumadin. Her current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 3 liters of nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6,000 cells per microliter, hemoglobin of 10.4 grams per deciliter, and platelet count of 176,000 cells per microliter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's massive PE is a significant risk factor for further embolic events, and anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent this.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and recent tracheo/bronchoplasty make her susceptible to respiratory failure, and close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's RV strain and pulmonary hypertension increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's low urine output and high urine specific gravity suggest fluid overload, which can exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac status.
5. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and immobility make her susceptible to infection, and close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection early.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases her risk of bleeding complications, and close monitoring of her hemoglobin and platelet count is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.

Plan:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory rate closely and adjust her oxygen therapy as necessary.
3. Continue COPD treatment with Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust her fluid therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
6. Monitor the patient's urine output and specific gravity closely to detect any signs of fluid overload.
7. Monitor the patient's laboratory results closely to detect any signs of infection or bleeding complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, which revealed large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain. She is currently receiving heparin infusion and Coumadin therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has mild tachypnea and rhonchi on examination, with bilateral leg edema and 2+ tibial edema. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with elevated troponin-T and creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain, which may lead to further pulmonary embolism and right ventricular dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and mild rhonchi on examination may indicate respiratory failure, which could worsen if not addressed.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's low urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and high urine specific gravity suggest fluid overload, which may worsen if not managed.
4. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's family history of clotting disorder and her recent surgery and rehabilitation may increase her risk of developing a hypercoagulable state, which could lead to further thrombotic events.
5. Right Ventricular Strain: The patient's echocardiogram showed dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis, which may worsen if not managed.
6. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to her recent surgery, rehabilitation, and respiratory compromise, leading to further respiratory failure.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's recent hyperglycemia may worsen if not managed, particularly with the use of steroids.
8. Infection: The patient's recent N/V and?D symptoms may indicate infection, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is normal, but may decrease if she develops a hypercoagulable state or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin infusion and Coumadin therapy to manage the patient's hypercoagulable state and prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider bronchodilators and oxygen therapy to manage her respiratory compromise.
3. Manage the patient's fluid status carefully to avoid fluid overload, and consider diuretics if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics and consider inotropes if her right ventricular strain worsens.
5. Continue COPD treatment and consider adjusting her medication regimen if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin regimen if necessary.
7. Consider anticoagulation therapy if the patient's hypercoagulable state is not managed with heparin and Coumadin.
8. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
9. Consider empiric antibiotics if the patient's symptoms worsen or if she develops a fever."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. They have been treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), steroids, and Coumadin. The patient has no known drug allergies. They have been receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, and tracheobronchomalacia.

Lab results show the patient has acute renal failure, hypokalemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient's white blood cell count is 5.8, hemoglobin is 30.3%, and platelet count is 154. The patient's creatinine is 0.5 mg/dL, troponin-T is 0.05 ng/mL, and lactic acid is 1.0 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE), which can cause respiratory distress, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Tracheobronchomalacia, which can cause respiratory distress, pneumonia, and increased risk of respiratory failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and increased risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and lab results, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status to prevent potential medical complications. The patient should be treated with aggressive fluid management, electrolyte replacement, and respiratory support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent a thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxemia due to a large saddle embolism and RV strain. She has been treated with heparin and coumadin, and has been weaned off oxygen therapy. Her current vital signs are: Tmax 36.4°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 97 bpm, BP 132/75 mmHg, RR 22 insp/min, and SpO2 96%. She has bilateral DVTs and is at risk for further clotting.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a SBP of 100-120 mmHg and HR in the 90-100s. She has been weaned off oxygen therapy, but still experiences mild SOB. Further management includes maximizing pulmonary dynamics, continuing heparin therapy, and discussing coumadin regimen on Monday.
2. RV Strain: The patient's ECHO shows dilated RV with moderate hypokinesis and pulmonary hypertension with preserved LV global function. She is preload-dependent and requires close monitoring of her hemodynamics.
3. COPD: The patient has significant underlying COPD, which is contributing to her overall pulmonary compromise. She will continue to receive COPD medications and steroid taper.
4. Recent N/V: The patient has a history of recent illness with no leukocytosis or fever on presentation. She will be monitored for further Cdif studies.
5. OSA: The patient has been tolerating CPAP well at rehab and will continue to receive it inpatient.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia due to steroids and will continue to receive FS QID and ISS.
7. s/p Thoracotomy: The patient's recent surgery will be followed up with thoracic and cardiac surgery recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Further clotting: The patient has bilateral DVTs and is at risk for further clotting, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or systemic embolization.
2. RV failure: The patient's RV strain could lead to RV failure, which could result in cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension could worsen, leading to right heart failure.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD could exacerbate, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia.
6. OSA: The patient's OSA could worsen, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Infection: The patient's recent illness and surgery make her susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure."
