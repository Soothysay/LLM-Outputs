   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output >200cc overnight.  Studies on pericardial
   fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30  Monos 10.
   Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - keep drain in for another until at least 4 hours after stops draining
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date.
   -          C diff in setting of recent hospitalization w Abx tx,
   persistent (chronic and unchanged) diarrhea, and rapid rise in WBC
   -          Repeat CBC to make sure it was accurate and check diff
   -          Other stool cultures
   -          SPEP/UPEP
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**], now
   held in the setting of pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.  Not
   currently on anticoagulation though she has a DVT.  No symptoms of SOB.
   -          held lovenox in setting of pericardial effusion
   -          restart lovenox while pericardial drain still in place today
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT, last night w rates into
   170s with significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT
   sustained, not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to
   adenosine.
   - continue metoprolol low dose as tolerated by BP
   # Anemia
   Stable Hct at 25-26. Patient continues to drain out hematogenous
   pericardial fluid, now more slowly.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hypoglycemia
   Episode this AM. Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency,
   insulin-producing or utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased
   hepatic or renal clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Patient had episode of Afib on floor, which she has apparently had in
   past, treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
   - monitoring on telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   -  primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
   # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion with unknown etiology, which may lead to cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias.
2. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's episode of SVT, which was not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage, may recur, leading to hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest, or stroke.
3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in her right leg, which may lead to pulmonary embolism, chronic venous insufficiency, or post-thrombotic syndrome.
4. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's sudden rise in WBC count and low-grade fevers may indicate an underlying infection, such as sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, septic shock, or death.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct of 25-26 may indicate chronic anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased exercise tolerance.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's episode of hypoglycemia may be due to adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or other underlying conditions, which can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, or coma.
7. Crohn's disease: The patient's chronic diarrhea and guaiac-negative stool may indicate active Crohn's disease, which can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, or bowel obstruction.
8. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's chronic leg and sacral edema may indicate fluid overload, cardiac failure, or lymphedema, which can lead to skin breakdown, infection, or amputation.
9. Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated Cr may indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or death.
10. Malignancy: The patient's small stable nodule on her kidney and central lymph nodes on her chest CT may indicate underlying malignancy, which can lead to metastasis, organ dysfunction, or death.

The patient's complex medical history, including her history of IBD, DVT, and pericardial effusion, requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize her outcomes."

   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output >200cc overnight.  Studies on pericardial
   fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30  Monos 10.
   Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - keep drain in for another 24 hours b/c of persistent drainage
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericardial pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**], now
   held in the setting of pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.  Not
   currently on anticoagulation though she has a DVT.  No symptoms of SOB.
   - hold lovenox in setting of pericardial effusion
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT, last night w rates into
   170s with significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT
   sustained, not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to
   adenosine.
   - continue metoprolol low dose as tolerated by BP
   # Anemia
   Stable Hct at 25-26. Patient continues to drain out hematogenous
   pericardial fluid, now more slowly.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hypoglycemia
   Episode this AM. Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency,
   insulin-producing or utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased
   hepatic or renal clearance
   - check LFTs
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Patient had episode of Afib on floor, which she has apparently had in
   past, treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
   - monitoring on telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily
   # Acute Diastolic Right Heart Failure:
   Patient has significant sacral edema. Likely worsened by acute RV
   backup secondary to impaired RV filling in setting of pericardial
   effusion and tamponade.  She does have history of lower extremity edema
   intermittently for a couple of years, which may otherwise be secondary
   to low albumin.
   # Low-grade Fever:
   Patient afebrile so far during hospitalization, and leukocytosis on
   presentation resolved.  Positive UA, but culture shows <10K organisms;
   was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which were
   discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for influenza.
   Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture- no growth
   to date.
   - Follow fever curve and wbc count
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
   # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade.

The patient had a significant event overnight, developing an atrial tachycardia (likely atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, or AVNRT) with a heart rate of 150-170 beats per minute (bpm). The tachycardia was sustained and not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage, but responded to 6mg IV adenosine. The patient's blood pressure dropped to 70 systolic, but she remained asymptomatic.

The patient also had a hypoglycemic episode this morning, with a blood sugar level of 52. The patient is not on insulin and is being considered for adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or decreased hepatic or renal clearance.

The patient has a pericardial drain in place, which has continued to ooze overnight, with dark serosanguinous fluid. The drain will be kept in place for another 24 hours, and repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today.

The patient has a history of IBD and has been treated with remicade. She has also had a recent episode of atrial fibrillation (Afib) on the floor, which was treated with IV metoprolol without a drop in blood pressure. The patient has a small stable nodule noted on her kidney on abdominal/pelvic CT, and chest CT shows central lymph nodes within normal size.

The patient has a complex medical condition, with multiple potential complications. Some potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade may worsen, leading to cardiac tamponade or acute diastolic right heart failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a pericardial drain in place, which may be a source of infection. The patient's leukocytosis on presentation has resolved, but blood culture results are pending.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated and stable at 1.1, which may worsen if the patient's fluid overload is not managed.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and will require ongoing treatment with levothyroxine.
5. Gout/pseudogout: The patient has a history of gout/pseudogout and will require ongoing treatment with allopurinol and colchicine.
6. Depression/anxiety: The patient has a history of depression/anxiety and may require ongoing treatment with medications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for about a month and may require ongoing nutritional support.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening cardiac function, infection, or other complications."

   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output >200cc overnight.  Studies on pericardial
   fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30  Monos 10.
   Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - keep drain in for another 24 hours b/c of persistent drainage
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericardial pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**], now
   held in the setting of pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.  Not
   currently on anticoagulation though she has a DVT.  No symptoms of SOB.
   - hold lovenox in setting of pericardial effusion
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT, last night w rates into
   170s with significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT
   sustained, not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to
   adenosine.
   - continue metoprolol low dose as tolerated by BP
   # Anemia
   Stable Hct at 25-26. Patient continues to drain out hematogenous
   pericardial fluid, now more slowly.
   - cont to monitor
   # Hypoglycemia
   Episode this AM. Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency,
   insulin-producing or utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased
   hepatic or renal clearance
   - check LFTs
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Patient had episode of Afib on floor, which she has apparently had in
   past, treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
   - monitoring on telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily
   # Acute Diastolic Right Heart Failure:
   Patient has significant sacral edema. Likely worsened by acute RV
   backup secondary to impaired RV filling in setting of pericardial
   effusion and tamponade.  She does have history of lower extremity edema
   intermittently for a couple of years, which may otherwise be secondary
   to low albumin.
   # Low-grade Fever:
   Patient afebrile so far during hospitalization, and leukocytosis on
   presentation resolved.  Positive UA, but culture shows <10K organisms;
   was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which were
   discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for influenza.
   Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture- no growth
   to date.
   - Follow fever curve and wbc count
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
   # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for overnight monitoring. She had a burst of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, which was sustained and not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage, but responded to adenosine. She also had a hypoglycemic episode in the morning. The patient's pericardial drain continued to ooze overnight, with dark serosanguinous fluid. Her hemodynamic status was stable, but she had significant sacral edema, which may be worsened by acute right ventricular (RV) backup secondary to impaired RV filling in the setting of pericardial effusion and tamponade.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade may worsen, leading to cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening.
2. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient's SVT may recur, and if not managed properly, can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemic episode may recur, and if not managed properly, can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
4. Acute diastolic right heart failure: The patient's sacral edema may worsen, leading to acute diastolic right heart failure, which can be life-threatening.
5. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level may worsen, leading to acute renal insufficiency, which can be life-threatening.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of pericardial effusion/tamponade may increase her risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
7. Malignancy: The patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade may be due to a malignant process, which can be life-threatening.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic diarrhea and guaiac-negative stools may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade and drain output.
2. Manage the patient's SVT with metoprolol and monitor for recurrent episodes.
3. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and manage hypoglycemia with insulin or glucagon if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and manage acute diastolic right heart failure with fluids and diuretics if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and manage acute renal insufficiency with fluids and diuretics if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's infection risk and manage any infections promptly and aggressively.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade to rule out a malignant process.
8. Consider further evaluation of the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade. She was transferred to the ICU for overnight monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain. The patient experienced a burst of atrial tachycardia, likely atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), which was sustained and not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. The episode was treated with 6mg IV adenosine, and the patient's heart rhythm returned to sinus rhythm.

The patient also experienced a hypoglycemic episode this morning with a blood sugar level of 52. Her pericardial drain continued to ooze overnight, with dark serosanguinous fluid output.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38°C (100.4°F)
* Heart rate: 98 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.5 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 26.9%
* Platelet count: 401 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 16 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient's pericardial drain output is greater than 200cc, and the etiology is likely malignant or infectious. The patient is immunosuppressed due to remicade treatment for IBD.
* Deep venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of right leg DVT and is currently not on anticoagulation due to the pericardial effusion of unknown etiology.
* Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of SVT, which was sustained and not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. The episode was treated with adenosine.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 25-26%.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced a hypoglycemic episode this morning, which may be due to adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or other causes.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient had an episode of Afib on the floor, which was treated with IV metoprolol without any drop in blood pressure.
* Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea and is being treated with remicade.
* Acute diastolic right heart failure: The patient has significant sacral edema, which may be worsened by acute RV backup secondary to impaired RV filling in the setting of pericardial effusion and tamponade.
* Low-grade fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be due to an underlying infection or other cause.
* Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated and stable at 1.1 from a baseline of 0.7.
* Nutrition: The patient has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for about a month, which may be contributing to volume overload. She can eat per orally, but not a significant amount of calories for sustainable nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and potential infection may increase her risk of sepsis.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal insufficiency may worsen if her creatinine level continues to increase.
* Volume overload: The patient's pericardial effusion and tamponade may worsen if her volume status is not carefully managed.
* Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat a significant amount of calories per orally may lead to malnutrition and other complications.
* Depression/anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety may worsen if she is not properly managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now until TTE - consider pulling drain
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - check C diff in setting of recent hospitalization w Abx tx,
   persistent (chronic and unchanged) diarrhea, and rapid rise in WBC
   - Repeat CBC to make sure it was accurate and check diff
   - Other stool cultures
   - SPEP/UPEP
   - blood, urine cultures
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily - consider discontinuing
   mesalamine
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted in attempt to find unifying diagnosis
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now until TTE - consider pulling drain
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - check C diff in setting of recent hospitalization w Abx tx,
   persistent (chronic and unchanged) diarrhea, and rapid rise in WBC
   - Repeat CBC to make sure it was accurate and check diff
   - Other stool cultures
   - SPEP/UPEP
   - blood, urine cultures
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - Mesalamine 1200 mg Tablet, three times daily - consider discontinuing
   mesalamine
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted in attempt to find unifying diagnosis
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for overnight monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion with a drain in place, and the fluid analysis shows white blood cell count 111, hemoglobin 12, and polymorphonuclear cells 60. The etiology of the effusion is unclear, but it is likely due to malignancy or infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been treated with albumin bolus and phenylephrine infusion. The blood pressure has increased with the increase in urine output.
3. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has a sudden rise in white blood cell count, and has been experiencing low-grade fevers. The etiology of the fever is unclear, but it may be due to opportunistic infection, malignancy, or other underlying conditions.
4. Anemia: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level of 25, but decreased to 21 yesterday. The cause of the anemia is unclear, but it may be due to bleeding, malnutrition, or other underlying conditions.
5. Deep Venous Thrombosis: The patient has a right leg DVT, which is being treated with heparin infusion.
6. Supraventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia, which was treated with adenosine.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia, which may be due to adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or other underlying conditions.
8. Crohn's disease: The patient has chronic diarrhea, and is being treated with infliximab and mesalamine.
9. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has chronic leg and sacral edema, which may be due to fluid overload, malnutrition, or other underlying conditions.
10. Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which may be due to acute kidney injury or other underlying conditions.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her various medical issues, including antibiotics, anticoagulation, and other medications. She is also receiving nutrition support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but this may be discontinued due to concerns about fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pericardial tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion may worsen, leading to cardiac tamponade.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and hypoglycemia may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further complications.
6. Malignancy: The patient's pericardial effusion and leukocytosis may be indicative of underlying malignancy, which could lead to further complications.

The patient's treatment plan should include ongoing monitoring of her various medical issues, as well as treatment of her underlying conditions. The patient's nutrition support should be re-evaluated, and the TPN may be discontinued if it is contributing to fluid overload. The patient's code status should be reviewed, and the patient should be educated about her medical condition and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion with a small-moderate partially echo-filled circumferential effusion without right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse. The patient is being monitored for tamponade and the pericardial drain is being continued.
* Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with phenylephrine and fluid boluses. The patient's blood pressure has improved with the treatment.
* Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has leukocytosis and a low-grade fever, which may be due to an opportunistic infection or malignancy. The patient is being monitored for signs of infection and is undergoing further testing to determine the cause of the fever.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is being managed with blood transfusions.
* Deep Venous Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT in the right leg and is currently being treated with heparin.
* Supraventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had an episode of SVT, which was managed with adenosine.
* Crohns disease: The patient has a history of Crohns disease and is being managed with infliximab.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient has had an episode of hypoglycemia, which is being managed with glucagon.
* Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has chronic leg and sacral edema, which is being managed with diuretics.
* Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient has acute renal insufficiency, which is being managed with fluids and diuretics.
* Nutrition: The patient is being managed with TPN, which is being held due to concerns about volume overload.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion may continue to increase and cause tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
* Malignancy: The patient's history of Crohns disease and the presence of a small nodule on the kidney may indicate the presence of malignancy, which can lead to further complications.
* Heart failure: The patient's history of DVT and the presence of a pericardial effusion may increase the risk of heart failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic pleural effusions may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's history of Crohns disease and the presence of a pericardial effusion may increase the risk of infection.

The patient's medical history and current condition indicate that she is at high risk for developing further complications. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient, Ms. [**Known lastname **], is a 61-year-old woman with a history of refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for overnight monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and she requires phenylephrine for pressure support. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to low intravascular volume, cardiac tamponade, or sepsis.
2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a low-grade fever. The etiology of the leukocytosis and fever is unclear, but it may be related to an opportunistic infection, malignancy, or a viral infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but her hematocrit is decreasing, indicating ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
4. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion with a partially echo-filled circumferential effusion. The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to malignancy, infection, or inflammatory disease.
5. Deep Venous Thrombosis: The patient has a right leg DVT, which was diagnosed recently. She is currently on anticoagulation therapy.
6. Supraventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which may be related to atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) or atrial fibrillation.
7. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is currently active.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, which may be related to adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or decreased hepatic or renal clearance.
9. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has chronic leg and sacral edema, which may be related to fluid overload, venous insufficiency, or compression from malignancy or enlarged lymph nodes.
10. Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, which may be related to volume overload, sepsis, or underlying kidney disease.
11. Nutrition: The patient is malnourished and has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for about a month. However, TPN may be contributing to volume overload, and the patient's nutrition plan needs to be reassessed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion may continue to worsen, leading to cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate an underlying septic process, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of anticoagulation therapy.
4. Malignancy: The patient's pericardial effusion and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying malignancy, which could lead to further complications and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic pleural effusions and lung disease may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
6. Kidney failure: The patient's acute renal insufficiency may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's Crohn's disease and recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's management plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and improving her overall nutrition and hydration status."

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient's condition remains complex and multifaceted. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion is likely malignant or infectious, and further studies are needed to determine the etiology. The patient is at risk for tamponade and cardiac arrest if the effusion worsens.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is not fully explained and may be due to various factors, including sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects. The patient is at risk for further episodes of hypotension and cardiovascular instability.
3. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may be due to an opportunistic infection, such as CMV, or a malignancy. The patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease and may worsen if not adequately managed.
5. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
6. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient's SVT may recur and may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Crohn's disease: The patient's Crohn's disease is likely to exacerbate if not adequately managed, and the patient is at risk for malnutrition and complications related to malnutrition.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or utilizing tumor, or other factors.
9. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient's edema may worsen due to fluid overload, poor nutritional status, and underlying cardiac or renal disease.
10. Acute Renal Insufficiency (AKI): The patient's AKI may worsen if not adequately managed, and the patient is at risk for further complications, including dialysis dependence.
11. Malignancy: The patient's history of small stable nodule on kidney and central lymph nodes on chest CT suggests a potential underlying malignancy, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and complications.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's medical team should continue to work together to address the patient's various medical issues and develop a comprehensive plan to optimize the patient's care."

   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.

   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:

   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT). She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

* Bloody pericardial drainage, which required the temporary discontinuation of heparin therapy
* Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation, which responded to adenosine and have been stable in sinus rhythm for 24 hours
* Leukocytosis and fever, which are being investigated as potential signs of infection or malignancy
* Anemia, which is being monitored and treated with transfusions
* Hypotension, which has been attributed to low intravascular volume and is being managed with fluid boluses and phenylephrine
* Acute renal insufficiency, which is being monitored and treated with fluids
* Lower extremity edema, which is being attributed to chronic conditions and is being managed with diuretics
* Hypothyroidism, which is being treated with levothyroxine
* Gout and pseudogout, which are being managed with allopurinol and colchicine
* Depression and anxiety, which are not currently being treated with medication

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade is a serious condition that requires close monitoring. The patient's pericardial drain output has been variable, and the etiology of the effusion is still unknown. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of the effusion and to monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate the presence of an infection, which could be bacterial, viral, or fungal in nature. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the infection and to initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Malignancy: The patient's history of IBD and the presence of a small stable nodule on her kidney suggest that she may be at risk for developing malignancy. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of her symptoms and to rule out the presence of cancer.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a concern, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this condition. The patient's blood pressure has been stable in the ICU, but further monitoring is needed to ensure that she does not develop hypotension again.
5. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's acute renal insufficiency is a concern, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this condition. The patient's creatinine level has been stable, but further monitoring is needed to ensure that she does not develop further kidney damage.
6. Lower extremity edema: The patient's lower extremity edema is a concern, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of this condition. The patient's edema may be attributed to chronic conditions, but further monitoring is needed to ensure that she does not develop further edema.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and further investigation to determine the cause of her symptoms and to initiate appropriate treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary

   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.

Based on the 24-hour events, the patient's condition has remained stable, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results. However, there are several potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion has not increased in size, and the pericardial drain output has decreased. However, the etiology of the effusion is still unclear, and further studies are needed to determine the cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and she has required treatment with albumin and phenylephrine. Further monitoring is needed to determine the cause of the hypotension and to prevent future episodes.
3. Leukocytosis and fever: The patient's white blood cell count has been elevated, and she has reported intermittent fevers. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever and to rule out opportunistic infections.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has been stable, but further monitoring is needed to determine if she is at risk for further bleeding.
5. Deep Venous Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT in her right leg, and she is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. Further monitoring is needed to determine if the DVT is progressing or if she is at risk for further thrombotic events.
6. Supraventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had an episode of SVT, which was treated with adenosine. Further monitoring is needed to determine if the SVT is recurrent and to rule out other cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, and she is currently receiving treatment with infliximab. Further monitoring is needed to determine if her symptoms are controlled and to adjust her treatment as needed.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been stable, but further monitoring is needed to determine if she is at risk for hypoglycemia.
9. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has chronic edema in her legs and sacrum, which may be related to her nutritional status and fluid overload. Further monitoring is needed to determine if her edema is improving and to adjust her treatment as needed.
10. Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level has been elevated, but it has remained stable. Further monitoring is needed to determine if her renal function is improving and to adjust her treatment as needed.
11. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is poor, and she is at risk for malnutrition. Further monitoring is needed to determine if her nutritional needs are being met and to adjust her treatment as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for several medical complications. Further monitoring and treatment are needed to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57.7 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), pericardial effusion with tamponade, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). Over the past 24 hours, heparin was stopped due to bloody pericardial drainage, and amiodarone was also stopped. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no evidence of biliary pathology, and a clean colonoscopy ruled out Crohn's disease or CMV in the gut. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 108/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving infusion of heparin sodium at a rate of 1,100 units/hour and is being monitored for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion with tamponade and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's bloody pericardial drainage and the need for heparin infusion to prevent further bleeding increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, including bleeding from the pericardial drain site, gastrointestinal tract, or other sites.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of respiratory failure or respiratory distress remains due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for respiratory support.
4. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and the presence of pericardial drains increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's impaired gut function and the need for mesalamine withdrawal increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's glycemic control is not specified, and the risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia remains.
7. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits, but the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease remains due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for medication.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is not specified, but the risk of neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, or encephalopathy, remains due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for medication.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological status are essential to prevent or manage these complications and ensure the patient's optimal outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for overnight monitoring s/p
   placement of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 300cc yesterday. 100cc overnight.  Studies on
   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60  Lymphs 30
   Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.  Patient is
   immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP concerned about
   possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on kidney in Abd/Pelvic
   CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last hospitalization shows central
   lymph nodes
top normal in size
 in subcarinal and paraesophageal
   areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - continue drain for now
   - repeat TTE today
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support. Increase in blood pressure
   with increase in urine output as well. No signs of tamponade.
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - hold beta blocker for now
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.
   - ID consult
 immunosuppressed patient with leukocytosis, fever and
   pressor requirement
   - follow up stool culture results
   - blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 yesterday in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Restarted heparin gtt will monitor drain output.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation yesterday. Spontaneously converted to NSR.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan.
   - holding TPN
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - GI consulted
 thinks likely viral infection
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.
   - AM cortisol
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.1 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - monitor creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.
   - hold TPN
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Based on the provided 24-hour events and progress note, I summarize the following potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion with a drain in place, and the output has decreased. Further studies are pending to determine the etiology, but it is likely to be malignant or infectious. The patient is immunosuppressed due to remicaide treatment for IBD, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections.
2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has a sudden rise in WBC count and is experiencing low-grade fevers. The patient is immunosuppressed, and potential CMV infection cannot be ruled out. The patient's history of intermittent fevers and negative workup by Rheumatology suggest a possible malignancy as a cause of the fever.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and they require pressor support. The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to low intravascular volume, sepsis, or a cardiac issue.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 25, but it decreased to 21 yesterday. The patient received a transfusion of PRBC, and guaiac-negative stools suggest no evidence of bleeding.
5. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in their right leg and is currently on heparin. The patient's DVT may be related to their immunosuppressive treatment for IBD.
6. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient had an episode of SVT, which responded to adenosine. The patient's atrial fibrillation yesterday spontaneously converted to NSR.
7. Crohn's disease: The patient has chronic diarrhea and is being treated with remicade. The patient's recent colonoscopy was negative for inflammation, and the patient is currently holding mesalamine due to GI recommendations.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are not stable, and they may be at risk for hypoglycemia. The patient's cortisol levels are normal, and adrenal insufficiency is unlikely.
9. Lower Extremity Edema: The patient has chronic edema in their legs and sacral region. The etiology is unclear, but it may be related to malnutrition, fluid overload, or compression from malignancy or enlarged lymph nodes.
10. Acute Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated and stable at 1.1. The patient's kidney function is improving with fluids, but close monitoring is necessary.

The patient's complex medical history, immunosuppressive treatment, and ongoing medical issues increase their risk for various complications. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are crucial to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and a diagnosis of pericardial effusion. The patient's 24-hour events include a TTE showing a small echo-dense pericardial effusion, consistent with blood, inflammation, or other cellular elements, with some stranding consistent with organization. The patient also had 800cc of diarrhea and has a history of allergies to Prevacid, penicillins, and nausea/vomiting. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.6°C, Tcurrent of 37.1°C, HR of 73 bpm, BP of 107/61 mmHg, RR of 13 insp/min, and SpO2 of 93%. The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 20.5, Hct of 26.9%, and a platelet count of 292 K/uL. The patient has a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), pericardial effusion with tamponade, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion with tamponade is a potential life-threatening complication that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's diagnosis of DVT is a potential complication that requires anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient's diagnosis of SVT is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent cardiac tamponade and other complications.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent skin breakdown and infection.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent stroke and other complications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent further bleeding and complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's history of respiratory failure is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
9. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis is a potential complication that requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage these potential medical complications."

   Echo
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

   Echo
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion:
   Pericardial drain output 100cc yesterday; no drainage overnight.
   Studies on pericardial fluid pending but show WBC 111 Hct 12  Polys 60
   Lymphs 30  Monos 10.  Etiology most likely malignant or infectious.
   Patient is immunosuppressed with remicaide treatment for IBD. PCP
   concerned about possible malignancy. Small stable nodule noted on
   kidney in Abd/Pelvic CT in [**Month (only) 2139**].  Chest CT during last
   hospitalization shows central lymph nodes
top normal in size
   subcarinal and paraesophageal areas, ranging up to 13mm.
   - f/u results of repeat TTE
   - if TTE shows no increasing effusion, can pull pericardial drain
   - continue colchine (for gout) which should help w/ pericarditic pain
   - monitor hemodynamic status
   - f/u studies on pericardial effusion fluid
   - continue heparin gtt for now, if drain output increased consider
   discontinuing heparin
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - holding beta blocker
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long period of time and
   has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with negative workup.
   Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture shows <10K
   organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on floor which
   were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out for
   influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood culture-
   no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever.  Pt is afebrile this
   morning and WBC is trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - follow up stool culture results
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - trend WBC, T
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - metoprolol held due to hypotension
   - consider amio if recurs
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN, will f/u calorie counts
   - d/c mesalamine per GI recs
 likely wasn
t helping
   - continue infliximab per schedule
   - f/u additional GI recs
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who was transferred to the ICU for monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/tamponade. She has a complex medical history, including Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, and gout/pseudogout. She is currently receiving treatment with remicade for IBD and has a history of immunosuppression.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Chest pain with a pericardial effusion/tamponade, with a small effusion on echocardiogram
* Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with rates into the 170s, which responded to adenosine
* Atrial fibrillation, which spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm
* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.5, which is trending down
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, which is stable
* Hypotension, which responded to albumin bolus and phenylephrine
* Fever, which is currently controlled
* DVT in the right leg, which is being treated with heparin
* Edema in the lower extremities, which is likely related to malnutrition and poor circulation
* Acute renal insufficiency, which is stable at a creatinine level of 1.0

Potential Medical Complications:

* Pericardial tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade is a potential life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
* DVT: The patient's DVT in the right leg is a potential source of embolism and requires anticoagulation therapy.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which requires further investigation and management.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to bleeding, malnutrition, or other underlying conditions, which requires further evaluation and management.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to various factors, including cardiac tamponade, sepsis, or other underlying conditions, which requires close monitoring and management.
* Fever: The patient's fever may be related to an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which requires further investigation and management.
* Edema: The patient's edema in the lower extremities may be related to malnutrition, poor circulation, or other underlying conditions, which requires further evaluation and management.
* Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's acute renal insufficiency may be related to various factors, including dehydration, sepsis, or other underlying conditions, which requires close monitoring and management.

Assessment and Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's pericardial effusion/tamponade and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Continue anticoagulation therapy for the patient's DVT.
* Investigate the patient's leukocytosis and anemia to determine the underlying cause and develop a plan for management.
* Monitor the patient's hypotension and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Investigate the patient's fever to determine the underlying cause and develop a plan for management.
* Evaluate the patient's edema in the lower extremities and develop a plan for management, including nutrition and hydration therapy.
* Monitor the patient's acute renal insufficiency and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Consider a multidisciplinary approach to the patient's care, including input from cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, and nephrology."

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion: Effusion stable by TTE. Drain removed. Etiology
   remains unclear. Malignancy remains consideration. Immunosuppression
   puts at risk for infection but workup negative so far.
   Continue colchicine for gout/pericardial pain
   Monitor hemodynamics.
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - continue betablocker.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers, with T: 99.6 today.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long
   period of time and has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with
   negative workup.  Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture
   shows <10K organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on
   floor which were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out
   for influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood
   culture- no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever. WBC is
   trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - Stool negative for O/P. CDiff
ve x1, viral Cx/fecal cx pending.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue amnio
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN until calore count completed.
   - mesalamine dc
   -Per GI may need to hold [**Month (only) 572**] remicaide.
   - GI signed off.
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Echo
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. There
   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pericardial effusion/tamponade. She was transferred from the cardiology service to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring. The patient has been experiencing chest pain, fever, and leukocytosis. She has a history of gout and pseudogout, and is currently on colchicine and allopurinol. She also has a history of depression and anxiety, but is not currently on medication.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.6°F, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%. She has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, which is being monitored. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no signs of ischemia or infarction.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 20.5 x 10^9/L. Her hemoglobin level is 8.1 g/dL, and her platelet count is 292 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and her renal function is stable. Her electrolyte levels are normal, and her blood glucose level is 110 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include IBD, DVT, pericardial effusion/tamponade, gout/pseudogout, and depression/anxiety. She is currently receiving treatment for her conditions, including colchicine, allopurinol, and Remicade.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pericardial tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, which can lead to cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest if not treated promptly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death if not treated promptly.
3. Inflammatory bowel disease: The patient has a history of IBD, which can lead to complications such as bowel perforation, abscesses, and sepsis if not treated promptly.

   is a very small pericardial effusion around the apex and anterior to
   the right ventricle and right atrium. The effusion is echo dense,
   consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements with
   some stranding c/w organization.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion: Effusion stable by TTE. Drain removed. Etiology
   remains unclear. Malignancy remains consideration. Immunosuppression
   puts at risk for infection but workup negative so far.
   Continue colchicine for gout/pericardial pain
   Monitor hemodynamics.
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - continue betablocker.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers, with T: 99.6 today.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long
   period of time and has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with
   negative workup.  Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture
   shows <10K organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on
   floor which were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out
   for influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood
   culture- no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever. WBC is
   trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - Stool negative for O/P. CDiff
ve x1, viral Cx/fecal cx pending.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue amnio
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN until calore count completed.
   - mesalamine dc
   -Per GI may need to hold [**Month (only) 572**] remicaide.
   - GI signed off.
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-2-13**], the size
   of the effusion is similar. There is now abnormal septal motion that
   may reflect early constriction.

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)
 PERICARDIAL EFFUSION WITH TAMPONADE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with hx of IBD, recent DVT, who is
   transferred from Cardiology service to CCU for monitoring s/p placement
   of pericardial drain for pericardial effusion/ tamponade.
   # Pericardial Effusion: Effusion stable by TTE. Drain removed. Etiology
   remains unclear. Malignancy remains consideration. Immunosuppression
   puts at risk for infection but workup negative so far.
   Continue colchicine for gout/pericardial pain
   Monitor hemodynamics.
   # Hypotension:
   Initially thought to be secondary to low intravascular volume. Was
   given albumin bolus with a marginal response in blood pressure. Urine
   output was decreased. Patient continued to mentate well. Decided to
   start phenylephrine for pressure support, which has now since been
   d/c
ed. No signs of tamponade now.  Etiology of episodes of hypotension
   not entirely clear.  Infectious w/u has not shown anything as of yet.
   Cortisol was elevated on lab work, ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
   - continue infection workup
   - monitor for tamponade
   - continue betablocker.
   .
   # Leukocytosis/Fever:
   Patient is immunosuppressed on Remicaide for IBD, so has potential for
   opportunistic infections.  Potential CMV infection. WBC count rose
   suddenly post-procedure, and patient continues to have low grade
   fevers, with T: 99.6 today.  She reports intermittent fevers for a long
   period of time and has been evaluated by Rheumatology in the past with
   negative workup.  Patient had positive UA on presentation, but culture
   shows <10K organisms; was started on treatment with cipro/flagyl on
   floor which were discontinued. CXR negative for infiltrate. Ruled out
   for influenza. Recent CT abd is without evidence of colitis. Blood
   culture- no growth to date. Maybe malignancy causing fever. WBC is
   trending down.
   - can consider ID consult if pt develops more fevers, leukocytosis
   - Stool negative for O/P. CDiff
ve x1, viral Cx/fecal cx pending.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Anemia:
   Stable hct at 25. Decreased to 21 2 days ago in setting of fluids. Was
   guaiac negative on floor. No evidence of bleed in GI or significant
   bleed in pericardial fluid. Transfused 1u pRBC for hct with response.
   No other symptoms.  Hct stable this morning.
   - monitor hct
   - monitor for bleeds
   - guaiac stools
   # Deep Venous Thrombosis:
   Found to have Right leg DVT in [**2184-11-16**] with plan for 6 month
   anticoagulation. Initially started on coumadin but quickly switched to
   enoxaparin because INR was consistently very supratherapeutic secondary
   to poor nutritional status.  Most recently on 40mg enoxaparin [**Hospital1 7**].  No
   symptoms of SOB. Currently on heparin gtt.
   - continue heparin gtt for now
   - monitor respiratory status
   # Supraventricular Tachycardia:
   Episode of SVT, regular rhythm, likely AVNRT w rates into 170s with
   significant drop in BPs, though patient asymptomatic. SVT sustained,
   not responsive to valsalva or carotid massage. Responded to adenosine.
   Also had atrial fibrillation. Spontaneously converted to NSR. Pt has
   been in SR for the past 24 hours.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue amnio
   - continue to monitor telemetry
   # Crohns disease:
   Patient with chronic diarrhea, guaiac negative. On remicade dosed every
   8 weeks. Colonoscopy last done in [**2184-3-17**].  Started on chronic TPN
   about 1 month ago for poor po nutrition.  Will need long term nutrition
   plan. Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN until calore count completed.
   - mesalamine dc
   -Per GI may need to hold [**Month (only) 572**] remicaide.
   - GI signed off.
   # Hypoglycemia
   Not on insulin. Consider adrenal insufficiency, insulin-producing or
   utilizing tumor.   Not likely due to decreased hepatic or renal
   clearance.  LFTs and renal function normal.  Cortisol was elevated.
   - continue to monitor blood sugar levels
   # Lower Extremity Edema:
   Patient has had significant leg and sacral edema chronically.  Not much
   edema in upper body but she does have persistent pleural effusions
   which may be of the same etiology.  Albumin is low and nutritional
   status very poor.  Fluid overload may be worsened by TPN use.  She has
   been on and off various doses of lasix with little effect and has no
   history of congestive heart failure.  Consider also something that may
   be compressing her IVC, such as malignancy or enlarge lymph nodes.
   Patient does have DVT in right lower extremity as well.
   - continue to monitor nutritional status
   - primary team should consider further malignancy workup
   # Acute renal insufficiency:
   Cr elevated and stable at 1.0 from baseline of 0.7. Improved earlier
   with fluids.
   - continue to trend creatinine
    # Nutrition:
   Patient has been on TPN for about 1 month, felt to be contributing to
   volume overload. She can eat per oral, but not significant amount of
   calories for sustainable nutrition.  Currently getting calorie counts.
   - holding TPN; following calorie counts
   - po nutrition
   # Hypothyroidism: Recently diagnosed.
   - Continue levothyroxine.
   # Hx Gout/Pseudogout:
   - continue allopurinol at renal dose
   - continue colchicine
   # Depression/Anxiety: not currently on meds

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and recent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring after placement of a pericardial drain for pericardial effusion and tamponade. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, gout, and depression/anxiety.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The effusion is stable, and the drain has been removed. The etiology remains unclear, and malignancy is a consideration.
* Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which have been treated with albumin boluses and phenylephrine. The etiology is unclear, and further workup is needed.
* Leukocytosis and fever: The patient has had a sudden increase in white blood cell count and low-grade fever, which may be related to opportunistic infections or malignancy.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but she has had a history of bleeding and may require further transfusions.
* Deep venous thrombosis: The patient has a DVT in her right leg, which is being treated with heparin.
* Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient has had an episode of SVT, which was treated with adenosine. She is currently in sinus rhythm.
* Crohn's disease: The patient has chronic diarrhea and is being treated with Remicade. She may need to hold her next dose of Remicade.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored, and she may require further treatment.
* Lower extremity edema: The patient has chronic edema in her legs, which may be related to her DVT or other underlying conditions.
* Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, but it has stabilized with fluids.
* Nutrition: The patient is being treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but this may need to be adjusted based on her calorie counts.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pericardial tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion may continue to cause tamponade, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
* Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent procedures make her at risk for opportunistic infections.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal insufficiency may worsen if her creatinine level continues to rise.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and reliance on TPN may lead to further complications if her calorie counts are not adequate.

Further evaluation and management of these potential complications will be necessary to ensure the patient's safe and effective care."
