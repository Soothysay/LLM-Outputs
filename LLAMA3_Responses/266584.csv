   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma who presents s/p L neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and
   myocutaneous pectoral flap, who was re-intubated post operatively for
   respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory/Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient is currently intubated,
   last ABG was 7.33/47/93/26 on Vent settings 600/16/10/100%FiO2
   saturating 98%.  Patient is stable, but there is concern that patient
   may have had aspiration event.  CXR shows RLL opacity that may be
   evolving aspiration pneumonia.  Patient is currently afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable.  For now, will monitor patient and attempt to
   wean FiO2.
   - Continue current vent setting
   - Attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   .
   #. s/p thyroidectomy:  Patient is at risk for hypocalcemia.  Currently
   hypocalcemic at 1.01.
   - Monitor free Calcium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who underwent a left neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and myocutaneous pectoral flap for metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. He was re-intubated post-operatively for respiratory distress.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and a chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe opacity that may be evolving aspiration pneumonia. He is currently afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but there is concern that he may have had an aspiration event.

The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia due to the thyroidectomy and has a current free calcium level of 1.01. He is also at risk for wound infection due to the myocutaneous flap and has six JP drains in place.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and type II, and is currently intubated, making it necessary to hold on restarting medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and the current chest X-ray findings suggest that he may be at risk for further aspiration events, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient's current free calcium level of 1.01 suggests that he may be at risk for hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
3. Wound infection: The patient's myocutaneous flap and JP drains make him at risk for wound infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death.
5. Sepsis: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia, wound infection, and diabetes make him at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.

In summary, the patient's conditions pose a significant risk for multiple medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia, hypocalcemia, wound infection, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these conditions are necessary to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   72 y/o male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma who presents s/p L neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and
   myocutaneous pectoral flap, who was re-intubated post operatively for
   respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory/Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient is currently intubated,
   last ABG was 7.33/47/93/26 on Vent settings 600/16/10/100%FiO2
   saturating 98%.  Patient is stable, but there is concern that patient
   may have had aspiration event.  CXR shows RLL opacity that may be
   evolving aspiration pneumonia.  Patient is currently afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable.  For now, will monitor patient and attempt to
   wean FiO2.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, who underwent a left neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and myocutaneous pectoral flap. He was reintubated post-operatively for respiratory distress.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes a CMV/ASSIST ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 368 K/uL. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 140 mmHg.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation status increase his risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient's total thyroidectomy and myocutaneous pectoral flap surgery increase his risk for hypocalcemia.
3. Wound infection: The patient's surgical wounds, including the six JP drains in place, increase his risk for wound infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma, as well as his current respiratory distress, increase his risk for sepsis.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and surgical history increase his risk for DVT.
6. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current intubation status increase his risk for hypertension.
7. Diabetes, type II: The patient's history of type II diabetes and current lack of food intake increase his risk for hyperglycemia.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory distress and intubation status increase his risk for respiratory failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing current ventilator settings.
2. Attempting to wean FiO2 as tolerated.
3. Holding on antibiotics for now.
4. Administering calcium gluconate to correct hypocalcemia.
5. Monitoring free calcium levels.
6. Keeping the wound clean and dry, but not dressing it for now.
7. Starting Cefazolin to prevent wound infection.
8. Holding on restarting medications, including BP medications and home metformin.
9. Starting SSI to manage hyperglycemia.
10. Providing pain management with prn Morphine.
11. Performing DVT prophylaxis with SQ Heparin.
12. Managing stress ulcer prophylaxis.
13. Monitoring for VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU for now, pending respiratory improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be made:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, who was re-intubated post-operatively for respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has a gag reflex present, but is producing brown sputum, which is concerning for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low-grade fever, and hypocalcemia. He has a history of metastatic disease and has undergone recent surgery, which may contribute to his current condition.

The patient's plan includes:

* Placement on AC vent settings
* Sending sputum specimen for culture
* Attempting to replace OG tube
* Treating aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and metronidazole
* Monitoring free calcium and phosphorus levels
* Repleting calcium IV as needed
* Continuing cefazolin for wound infection
* Holding BP medications
* Holding home metformin
* Continuing SSI for diabetes type II
* Maintaining NPO status
* Administering pain management with prn fentanyl boluses

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's brown sputum production and witnessed aspiration event last night increase the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
* Hypocalcemia: The patient's current hypocalcemic state may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
* Wound infection: The patient's surgical wound on his chest is at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure and the need for further interventions.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and low-grade fever may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
* DVT: The patient's history of metastatic disease and recent surgery increase the risk of developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of thyroid cancer, who underwent a radical neck dissection complicated by aspiration pneumonitis and required re-intubation. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status is stable, with minimal evolution of significant new focal consolidation or infiltrate. However, he has asymmetric lung volumes, right less than left, and a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). His secretions have decreased, and he is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for 45 minutes. The plan is to return to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and await full alertness before considering extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to the underlying aspiration pneumonitis and potential for new pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's CXR shows minimal evolution of significant infiltrate, there is still a risk of developing pneumonia, particularly given his history of aspiration and respiratory failure.
3. Aspiration: The patient's cuff leak and gag reflex suggest that there may be ongoing aspiration, which could lead to further respiratory compromise.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to further respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest potential cardiovascular instability, which could be exacerbated by further respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and inability to follow commands suggest potential neurological complications, which could be related to the aspiration pneumonitis or sepsis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and potential gastrointestinal compromise due to the aspiration pneumonitis could lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who underwent a left neck dissection and was reintubated for respiratory distress. He is currently extubated and requires oxygen therapy. The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and has undergone a thyroidectomy with parathyroidectomy.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still requiring oxygen therapy, which may be due to fluid overload or aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia/pneumonitis: The patient has thick secretions, which may be a result of colonization rather than infection. The patient's WBC count is trending down, but he is still receiving antibiotics.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia due to his thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy.
4. Wound infection: The patient has a closed wound with five JP drains in place, which may be at risk for infection.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and his medications have been held due to concerns about sepsis.
6. Diabetes, type II: The patient's home metformin has been held, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored.
7. FEN (Fecal Occult Blood Test): The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, and a video speech and swallow evaluation is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonitis make him at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated blood pressure and risk of wound infection make him at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Hypocalcemic crisis: The patient's risk of hypocalcemia due to his thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy makes him at risk for developing a hypocalcemic crisis.
4. Wound infection: The patient's closed wound with five JP drains in place makes him at risk for developing a wound infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure makes him at risk for developing further respiratory complications.
6. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis and thick secretions make him at risk for further aspiration events."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma who presents s/p L neck dissection reintubated for
   respiratory distress now extubated again.
   -          #. Respiratory failure:  Extubated but still requiring O2,
   possibly fluid overload, but more likely aspiration pneumonitis
   -                 -incentive spirometer
   -                 - wean O2
   # Aspiration Pneumonia/pneumonitis:  Still has thick secretions, though
   not nearly as much. WBC trending down post op but has also been getting
   Abx. No infiltrate on CXR.  4+ GNRs in sputum may represent
   colonization.
   - Consider d/c Levo/Flagyl
   - f/u  Sputum Cx

   -          Replete Calcium IV
   .
   #. s/p L myocutaneous flap:  Wound is closed, with six JP drains in
   place.  Recommendation is to keep wound clensed, but not dressed for
   now.  Of note, patient had a prior R thigh MSSA abcess earlier this
   month.
   - Continue Cefazolin 1g q8hrs per ENT
   .
   #. Hypertension: SBPs .  Patient is on lisinopril at home.  Given that
   patient is currently intubated, and concerned about patient becoming
   septic, will hold on restarting medications.
   - Hold BP medications

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who underwent a left neck dissection and was reintubated for respiratory distress. He is now extubated and being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/63 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 368. His creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and his total CO2 is 23 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds diffusely, a soft abdomen, and trace edema. His wound is closed, with six JP drains in place.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and a history of respiratory failure. He is at risk for aspiration pneumonitis, hypocalcemia, and sepsis.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will be weaned off oxygen and encouraged to use an incentive spirometer.
2. Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: The patient will be monitored for signs of aspiration, and his sputum will be cultured to determine the presence of colonization.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient will be monitored for hypocalcemia, and calcium will be repleted IV as needed.
4. Wound care: The patient's wound will be kept clean and moist, but not dressed, to promote healing.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure medication will be held until further evaluation.
6. Diabetes: The patient's home metformin will be held, and his blood sugar will be monitored.
7. Nutrition: The patient will be monitored for signs of malnutrition and will receive nutritional support as needed.
8. Pain management: The patient will receive pain management with prn fentanyl boluses.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his recent respiratory failure and the presence of thick secretions.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his recent surgery and the presence of colonization in his sputum.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia due to his recent surgery and the presence of parathyroidectomy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his recent respiratory failure and the presence of thick secretions.
5. Wound infection: The patient is at risk for wound infection due to the presence of six JP drains in his wound.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his recent surgery and the presence of immobility.
7. Hypertension: The patient is at risk for hypertension due to his recent surgery and the presence of stress.
8. Diabetes: The patient is at risk for diabetes due to his recent surgery and the presence of malnutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer, who underwent total thyroidectomy. The patient's post-operative course was complicated by an aspiration event, requiring re-intubation. The patient is currently extubated and stable on 2L NC oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/73 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 98% on 2L NC oxygen.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient had an aspiration event, which may have caused pneumonitis.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a sodium level of 151 mg/dL, which is elevated.
3. Neurological deficit: The patient has a facial nerve deficit, which may be related to the surgical removal of the parotid gland.
4. Hypoparathyroidism: Although the patient does not have evidence of hypoparathyroidism, it is a potential complication of thyroidectomy.
5. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and should receive prophylaxis.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers and should receive prophylaxis.
7. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and should receive prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 17.0
* Hct: 33.0
* Plt: 368
* Cr: 0.9
* TCO2: 23
* Glucose: 157

The patient's plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: Wean FiO2 to keep SpO2 >92%.
2. Thyroidectomy: Continue IV synthroid and follow up on pathology specimen.
3. Hypernatremia: Replete free water with D5W every 8 hours.
4. Nutrition: Follow up on speech and swallow eval and VFSS, and continue NPO.
5. Neurological deficit: Continue to monitor and follow up on facial nerve deficit.
6. ICU care: Continue to monitor and manage the patient's condition in the ICU."
