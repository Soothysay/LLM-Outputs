   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Femoral catheter pulled without incident, no residual hematoma.  Pt
   denied further episodes of chest pain, had some back pain which
   resolved.  Weaned off nitro gtt.  No longer on integrilin this AM.
   Overnight, had Foley catheter placed with some resistance, blood in
   tube and abdominal pain.  Foley pulled and bladder scan showed ~600cc
   urine.  Urology was called and they recommended a Coude catheter.  This
   was placed and urine drained which was red in color.  Continues to
   drain red urine.  Pt denies further pain.
   ROS otherwise negative for chest pain, SOB, back pain, diaphoresis, N/V
   or abdominal pain.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and ongoing chest and back pain. The patient's condition has been stable, with cardiac enzymes trending down.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 95%, and there is no evidence of respiratory distress. However, the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to prevent respiratory complications.
3. Renal complications: The patient's urine output is increased, and there is red blood draining from the Coude catheter, which may indicate urinary tract infection or bleeding.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, and there is a risk of neurological complications, such as worsening Parkinson's symptoms or development of new neurological deficits.
5. Hematological complications: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 34.1 to 32.6, which may indicate bleeding or anemia.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diet has been restricted to a cardiac diet, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea.
7. Infection complications: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, which increases the risk of urinary tract infection. The patient's wound site should be closely monitored for signs of infection.

In terms of the patient's current status, the note indicates that the patient is currently stable, with no signs of chest pain, shortness of breath, or back pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the patient is able to ambulate. However, the patient's urine output is increased, and there is red blood draining from the Coude catheter, which may indicate urinary tract infection or bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, which may indicate bleeding or anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and continued chest and back pain. He has undergone coronary angiography and stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and diagonal branch (diag). He is currently receiving nitroglycerin, aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and beta-blocker therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His physical examination is notable for bilateral 1+ edema, intention tremor of the right hand, and strength 4/5 in both upper extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of his platelet count and bleeding risk assessment are necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 11.7 g/dL to 10.4 g/dL, which may be related to his NSTEMI or other underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the cause of his anemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 113/59 mmHg, which may be related to his NSTEMI or other underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and volume status is necessary.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and is at risk for neurological complications such as stroke or seizures. Close monitoring of his neurological status is necessary.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is necessary.
7. Infection risk: The patient is at risk for infection due to his NSTEMI and other underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring of his temperature and white blood cell count is necessary.
8. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.3 mg/dL, which may be related to his NSTEMI or other underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring of his renal function is necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, and coronary artery disease. He presented with chest and back pain, which has since resolved. He has a LMCA lesion with a Cypher stent placed, a 90% diagonal lesion with a minivision stent placed, and a RCA lesion with 50-60% stenosis. Cardiac enzymes have peaked and are trending down. He is being managed with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol.

The patient has significant hematuria and is experiencing suprapubic discomfort, which has been managed with irrigation and clot removal. He has a foley catheter in place and requires flushing every 4 hours. Urology has been consulted and recommended continuing current management if pain persists, with the option to start detrol 5mg tid.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a HCT of 32-33, and is being managed with heparin. He also has a history of urinary retention, likely secondary to BPH, and is taking Terazosin as per home dose. He has never taken Finasteride and does not have an outpatient urologist.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to continued hematuria and clot removal.
2. Respiratory compromise due to fluid overload and potential cardiac dysfunction.
3. Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest, given the patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI.
4. Infection complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, or UTI, given the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling catheters.
5. Neurological complications, including Parkinson's disease, given the patient's age and potential for neurological deterioration.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, given the patient's history of cardiac disease and potential for gastrointestinal compromise.
7. Renal complications, including acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, given the patient's history of anemia and potential for nephrotoxicity.
8. Thrombotic complications, including DVT or PE, given the patient's history of CAD and potential for thrombosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust management accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   # CORONARIES: CP today although similar in character to presentation
   initially, upon further questioning similar to spinal pain.  No
   trauma.  Feel this is most likely musculoskeletal in origin, but  given
   similar sx to anginal equivalent, will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Unlikely
   intrastent thrombosis given lack of STelevations.  Initially presented
   with NSTEMI (vs STEMI) found to have LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed),
   90% diag (minivision stent placed) and RCA lesion (50-60%; not
   stented).
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - 250cc bolus s/p NTG to maintain BPs
   - Pain control w/ IV morphine, OOB and PT
   - Continue with aspirin, plavix, Lipitor 80mg and Metoprolol 25mg PO
   BID
   - holding on ACE due to hypotension, will restart once CP controlled
   and no SBPs > 110 systolic.
   - will need lifetime Plavix, given ASA, Plavix, will continue
   Ranitidine
   .
   # BACK PAIN: Likely anginal equivalent but also possible [**2-28**] spinal
   stenosis.  Cycling enzymes as above.  Morphine for pain control for
   now.  OOB/PT.  will reassess if continued poor control.
   .
   # PUMP:  Euvolemic on exam, LVEF 50% w/ septal hypertrophy and mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid to
   distal anterior hypokinesis.  Consistent w/ Cath.
   -          Continued BBK, no lasix for now
   -          Will need to start ACE-I as soon as BPs tolerate.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR, monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANEMIA: HCT dropped 40 to 32.6 from OSH to now, but has been stable
   32-34.   No GI source of bleeding.   Hematuria, now improving (see
   below).
   -          HCT stable, continue to trend
   -          Guiac all stools
   .
   # Urinary Retention: likely secondary to BPH.  Pt is on Terazosin as
   per home dose.  Has never taken Finasteride.  Does not have outpatient
   urologist.  Has traumatic foley placement, now w/ Coude catheter and
   requiring irrigation Q3-4hrs for UOP, removing frequent clots.  Pt. w/
   one episode of suprapubic pain, did not require Detrol.
   - Discussed w/ urology will see him today, will likely perform a
   voiding trial.
   - continue Terazosin

   was asleep, so did not start).  They will see him in AM.  HCT stable at
   32-33.
   This AM pt. developed chest pain (central) and back pain, similar to
   pain on  presentation/cath course in character but lower in intensity
   5/10max.  On further questioning, pt has had similar pain PTA for many
   months. VS were wnl.  ECG showed new TwI in V2,4, w/ no other
   abnormalities.  Pt. was given SLNitro x3 w/ reduction in pain to [**2-5**]
   then complete resolution after morphine 1mg x1.  ECG when CP free w/
   biphasic Tw in V2,4

   Assessment and Plan
   77M with CAD who presents with NSTEMI and continued chest and back
   pain.
   .
   # CORONARIES: CP today although similar in character to presentation
   initially, upon further questioning similar to spinal pain.  No
   trauma.  Feel this is most likely musculoskeletal in origin, but  given
   similar sx to anginal equivalent, will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Unlikely
   intrastent thrombosis given lack of STelevations.  Initially presented
   with NSTEMI (vs STEMI) found to have LMCA lesion (Cypher stent placed),
   90% diag (minivision stent placed) and RCA lesion (50-60%; not
   stented).
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - 250cc bolus s/p NTG to maintain BPs
   - Pain control w/ IV morphine, OOB and PT
   - Continue with aspirin, plavix, Lipitor 80mg and Metoprolol 25mg PO
   BID
   - holding on ACE due to hypotension, will restart once CP controlled
   and no SBPs > 110 systolic.
   - will need lifetime Plavix, given ASA, Plavix, will continue
   Ranitidine
   .
   # BACK PAIN: Likely anginal equivalent but also possible [**2-28**] spinal
   stenosis.  Cycling enzymes as above.  Morphine for pain control for
   now.  OOB/PT.  will reassess if continued poor control.
   .
   # PUMP:  Euvolemic on exam, LVEF 50% w/ septal hypertrophy and mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid to
   distal anterior hypokinesis.  Consistent w/ Cath.
   -          Continued BBK, no lasix for now
   -          Will need to start ACE-I as soon as BPs tolerate.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR, monitor on tele.
   .
   # ANEMIA: HCT dropped 40 to 32.6 from OSH to now, but has been stable
   32-34.   No GI source of bleeding.   Hematuria, now improving (see
   below).
   -          HCT stable, continue to trend
   -          Guiac all stools
   .
   # Urinary Retention: likely secondary to BPH.  Pt is on Terazosin as
   per home dose.  Has never taken Finasteride.  Does not have outpatient
   urologist.  Has traumatic foley placement, now w/ Coude catheter and
   requiring irrigation Q3-4hrs for UOP, removing frequent clots.  Pt. w/
   one episode of suprapubic pain, did not require Detrol.
   - Discussed w/ urology will see him today, will likely perform a
   voiding trial.
   - continue Terazosin
   .
   # PARKINSONS:  Consider sinemet.
   .
   #. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS:  On MTX at home; will hold this in the
   short-term though will need to be restarted long-term.
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac diet
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   # PROPHYLAXIS: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # CODE: Full code; discussed with patient and family at time of
   admission to CCU
   # DISPO: Call out to floor now chest pain free

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and continued chest and back pain. The patient has a complex medical history, including a recent cardiac catheterization with placement of a Cypher stent in the left main coronary artery and a minivision stent in the 90% diagonal coronary artery. He also has a 50-60% lesion in the right coronary artery that was not stented.

The patient has been experiencing chest pain and back pain, which was initially thought to be anginal equivalent but was later determined to be likely musculoskeletal in origin. He has been prescribed aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol for cardiac management.

The patient has also been experiencing hematuria, which has been managed with irrigation and clot removal. He has a foley catheter in place and is requiring irrigation every 3-4 hours for urinary output. The patient has had one episode of suprapubic pain, but it did not require the use of Detrol.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 32-34. He has been stable on this level, and his anemia is not thought to be related to a gastrointestinal source of bleeding.

The patient has also been experiencing urinary retention, which is likely secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). He is taking Terazosin as per his home dose and has never taken Finasteride. He does not have an outpatient urologist and has had a traumatic foley placement.

The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and is being considered for treatment with Sinemet.

The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is taking methotrexate at home. He will need to hold this medication in the short-term but will need to restart it long-term.

The patient has been prescribed a cardiac diet and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis with subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone cardiac catheterization. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Hematuria: The patient has been experiencing hematuria, which can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, and kidney damage.
3. Urinary retention: The patient has urinary retention, which can lead to complications such as infection, kidney damage, and bladder rupture.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
5. Parkinson's disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease, which can lead to complications such as motor dysfunction, speech and language difficulties, and cognitive impairment.
6. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient has rheumatoid arthritis, which can lead to complications such as joint damage, decreased mobility, and increased risk of infection.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to his cardiac status and immobility.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor him closely for any signs of complications and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."
