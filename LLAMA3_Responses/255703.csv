 ANXIETY
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, coronary artery disease and
   non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia: Worsening over the past three days.  Imaging suggestive of
   multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration.  Of concern, patient has
   been on high dose steroids for the past month.  No evidence of large
   pulmonary embolism on CT scan.  Cardiac enzymes not elevated.  Likely
   worsened by anemia.  Currently maintaining oxygen saturations with 50%
   face tent.  Not using accessory muscles currently.  ABG with
   respiratory alkalosis.  Although patient with evidence of anasarca, do
   not feel that pulmonary edema is large component of his current
   presentation.
   - vancomycin and zosyn for health care associated pneumonia
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - sputum culture
   - induced sputum for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 72**] culture, AFB
   - NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation
   - repeat EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - repeat CXR today
   Hydropneumothorax:  Noted on recent CT scan.  Concern for bronchial
   stump leak.  Surgery not performed here.
   - will consult with thoracis regarding finding
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  Per notes continues to have [**2-13**] bloody
   bowel movements per day without significant improvement since
   presentation.  Sigmoidoscopy on [**12-1**] with persistent severe
   inflammation.  Now on methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID.  No longer on
   cyclosporin. Patient with significant malnutrition and anasarca.
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue TPN
   - NPO for now given concern for aspiration
   - GI surgery following
   - c. diff negative most recently on [**12-3**]
   Acute Blood Loss Anemia:  Patient with known gastrointestinal bleeding
   and witnessed blood loss from pulling out PICC in the setting of
   elevated INR yesterday.  Now s/p 2 units of PRBC with hematocrit
   increase from only 21.3 to 25.3.
   - active type and screen
   - currently PICC line and 1 22 g IV, will obtain additional peripheral
   access
   - repeat hematocrit tonight
   - GI following
   DV: Incidental finding of right sided lower extremity DVT.  INR
   currently 2.4.  Currently hemodynamically stable but in the setting of
   gastrointestinal bleeding will hold coumadin for now and let INRtrend
   down.  If persistent bleeding, would consider IVC filter.
   - holding coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus: In the setting of poor nutrition,
   hypoalbuminemia and bedrest.
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   Hypothyroidism: Home dose is synthroid PO 88 mcg daily
   - IV synthroid 50 mcg daily
   CAD s/p MI: No chest pain or new EKG changes currently.  Troponins
   flat.
   - holding aspirin, beta blocker (given NPO)
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   NSCLC s/p resection: As above, concern for bronchial stump leak.
   Otherwise no active issues.
   Prostate Cancer:  s/p prostatectomy. CT with sclerotic/lucent lesions
   in vertebral bodies but bone scan okay.
   - outpatient oncology followup
   Type II Diabetes:
   - receives 37 units regular insulin in TPN
   - TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, 1 22 g IV
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, protonix

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his oxygen requirements are increasing. He is also at risk for pneumonia due to aspiration, which could worsen his respiratory status.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hematocrit is still low despite receiving 2 units of PRBC.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated with IV synthroid, but his hypothyroidism may not be adequately managed, which could lead to complications.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has malnutrition, which is a risk factor for various complications, including infections, impaired wound healing, and decreased immune function.
5. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. DVT: The patient has a right-sided lower extremity DVT, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism and other complications.
7. Bronchial stump leak: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and a bronchial stump leak, which could lead to respiratory complications if not properly managed.
8. Aspiration: The patient has a risk of aspiration due to his respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to pneumonia and other complications.
9. Infections: The patient has a history of immunosuppressive therapy, which increases his risk of infections. He also has a central line, which is a risk factor for central line-associated bloodstream infections.
10. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to his anemia and thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various complications due to his underlying medical conditions, medications, and therapies. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has developed acute respiratory failure, acute anemia, and impaired skin integrity. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and recent imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration. He is receiving treatment for HAP with vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being managed for his underlying conditions, including ulcerative colitis, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, and may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and cardiac arrest.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, and may lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, and increased risk of infection.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent imaging suggesting multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration increases his risk of further bleeding and perforation.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of recent hospitalization increase his risk of infection, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's recent diagnosis of right-sided lower extremity DVT and history of coronary artery disease increase his risk of further thrombotic events, such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.
6. Wound infection: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer increases his risk of wound infection and further complications such as osteomyelitis and sepsis.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not managed properly, and may lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, and decreased immune function.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutrition and hypoalbuminemia increase his risk of further nutritional deficiencies, which may worsen his underlying conditions and increase his risk of infection and other complications.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's underlying conditions, as well as aggressive treatment of any new complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirements have been increasing over the past three days, and imaging suggests multifocal pneumonia likely due to aspiration. The patient is also immunosuppressed, which worsens the condition.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding and witnessed blood loss from pulling out the PICC line. The patient has received 2 units of PRBC, and the hematocrit has increased from 21.3 to 25-26.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the ABG shows respiratory alkalosis. The patient requires oxygen therapy and is at risk for further respiratory compromise.
4. Hydropneumothorax: A recent CT scan has revealed a hydropneumothorax, which is a concern for bronchial stump leak.
5. Presumed Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has persistent severe inflammation and bleeding, and the sigmoidoscopy on [**12-1**] showed severe inflammation. The patient is currently on methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID.
6. DVT: An incidental finding of right-sided lower extremity DVT was noted, and the INR is currently 2.2.
7. Stage II Sacral/Buttock Decubitus: The patient has poor nutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and bedrest, which has led to a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's home dose of synthroid is 88 mcg daily, and the IV dose is 50 mcg daily.
9. CAD s/p MI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has had a myocardial infarction. The patient is currently stable, but the troponins are flat.
10. NSCLC s/p resection: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and has had a resection. There is a concern for bronchial stump leak.
11. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer and has had a prostatectomy. There are sclerotic/lucent lesions in the vertebral bodies on CT, but the bone scan is okay.
12. Type II Diabetes: The patient receives 37 units of regular insulin in TPN and has a sliding scale of insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of hypoxia due to respiratory failure or further bleeding.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and pneumonia.
3. Further bleeding or hematoma formation due to the patient's coagulopathy and DVT.
4. Worsening of the stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer due to poor nutrition and hypoalbuminemia.
5. Development of pneumonia or respiratory failure due to aspiration or bronchial stump leak.
6. Worsening of the patient's anemia due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate transfusion.
7. Development of electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's TPN and medications.
8. Worsening of the patient's respiratory alkalosis due to continued respiratory failure.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory status, bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient should also be continued on TPN and receive wound care for the stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch-tall individual who was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent VATS surgery, and probable aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 102/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They have a PICC line inserted and are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and anticoagulants.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds, and they are unable to assess the patient's peripheral pulses. They have sacral decubitus ulcers and are unable to assess their skin tone.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. They also have elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary diagnosis is acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely related to their severe emphysema, recent VATS surgery, and probable aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to continue with vanc/zosyn antibiotics and keep the patient NPO until a speech and swallow evaluation is performed.

The patient also has secondary diagnoses, including anemia, likely due to GI bleeding; colitis, which is severe and requires TPN; hydropneumothorax, likely related to recent surgery; and decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they may require mechanical ventilation to support their breathing.
2. GI bleeding: The patient's anemia and colitis suggest ongoing GI bleeding, which can lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immobility increase their risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's anemia, colitis, and possible GI bleeding increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's immobility and recent surgery increase their risk of developing thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
6. Wound complications: The patient's decubitus ulcers increase their risk of developing wound complications, such as infection or further tissue damage.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has developed acute respiratory failure, acute anemia, impaired skin integrity, delirium, and anxiety. He has a history of witnessed aspiration and is at risk for pneumonia. He is on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, which may have contributed to his compromised immune system. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and ongoing issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to his immunosuppressed state and recent witnessed aspiration event.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may worsen, leading to further compromise of his respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
4. Skin Integrity Issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as infection or necrosis.
5. Delirium and Anxiety: The patient's delirium and anxiety may worsen, leading to further distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
7. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract may worsen, leading to further complications.
8. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system makes him susceptible to infection, which could lead to further complications.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction makes him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, coronary artery disease and
   non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia/Possible PNA: Required 95% high flow after witnessed aspiration
   but now back to 60%; previous CT consistant with multifocal pneumonia
   and aspiration.  Also concern for immunosuppressed state given chronic
   steroid use.  ABG with continued respiratory alkalosis.
   - consider switch vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  continue w/ bloody bowel movement with
   HCT drop.
   - 2 units RBC this am
   - q8 HCT checks
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID

   Acute Blood loss: continues slow GI bleed as above; no evidence of
   additional souce of bleeding
   - active type and screen
   - q8 HCT checks
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.  INR elevated but
   trending down (1.7)
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient required high-flow oxygen therapy (95%) after a witnessed aspiration event, but is now back to 60% oxygen.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage and bleeding).
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has stage II sacral/buttock decubitus.
4. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium and confusion.
5. Anxiety: The patient is anxious.
6. Hypoxia/possible PNA: The patient has hypoxia and possible pneumonia (PNA) with multifocal pneumonia and aspiration on CT scan.
7. Chronic steroid use: The patient is immunosuppressed due to chronic steroid use.
8. Coronary artery disease: The patient has coronary artery disease and has had a myocardial infarction (MI).
9. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer and has undergone VATS and left upper lobectomy.
10. Type II diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes and is receiving insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to increased oxygen requirements or even mechanical ventilation.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia can worsen if there is continued bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and chronic steroid use make him susceptible to infection, particularly pneumonia.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and history of MI make him at risk for cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
5. Wound complications: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus can lead to wound complications such as infection, abscess formation, or delayed healing.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and confusion can worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, or other neurological complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ulcerative colitis and recent bleeding can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as perforation, abscess formation, or obstruction.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Oxygen therapy: The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen therapy to improve oxygenation.
2. Blood transfusion: The patient received 2 units of blood to address anemia.
3. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to treat possible PNA and aspiration.
4. Corticosteroids: The patient is receiving methylprednisolone to treat acute anemia and respiratory distress.
5. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management with albuterol and ipratropium.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent a VATS lobectomy for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of UC, colitis, CAD, NSCLC, DVT, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.4°C, HR 100 bpm with PVCs, BP 95/47 mmHg, RR 28 inspirations per minute, SpO2 92% on HF mask
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 25/15 mmHg
* Respiratory support: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with oxygen delivery device
* Laboratory results:
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb) 7.7 g/dL
	+ Platelet count (Plt) 105 K/uL
	+ White blood cell count (WBC) 3.9 K/uL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 38 mg/dL
	+ Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL
	+ TropT <0.01 ng/mL
	+ Troponin-T <0.01 ng/mL
* Physical examination: Awake, alert, with a few crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft abdomen, and warm skin

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia due to recent VATS surgery and severe emphysema
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to potential infection, bleeding, or colitis
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to hypoxia, bleeding, or colitis
5. Decubitus ulcer due to prolonged bed rest
6. Anemia due to acute blood loss or colitis
7. Electrolyte imbalance due to hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, or gastrointestinal bleeding
8. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and recent surgery
9. Potential for reintubation due to worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure
10. Risk of death due to underlying comorbidities, acute illness, and potential complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation with a high-flow nasal cannula
2. Antibiotics for potential infection and sepsis
3. IV fluids and vasopressors for hypotension
4. Pain management with opioids and acetaminophen
5. Wound care for potential decubitus ulcer
6. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
7. Monitoring for potential complications, including sepsis, AKI, and ARDS."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, including a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for several conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hydropneumothorax, anemia, colitis, and decubitus ulcer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 95/47 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% and is being supported with high-flow nasal oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and the differential count shows a predominance of neutrophils.

The patient's medical plan includes the continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, as well as the administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and supplemental oxygen. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's anemia, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and white blood cell count may indicate the presence of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately treated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
4. Colitis: The patient's severe colitis may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
5. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may lead to infection and sepsis.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to cardiovascular complications.
8. Prostate cancer: The patient's prostate cancer may progress if not adequately treated, leading to metastasis and complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's TPN may not provide adequate nutrition, leading to malnutrition and complications.
10. Infection: The patient's multiple comorbidities and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tacypnea. He has a presumed diagnosis of HAP/Aspiration PNA and is being treated with vanc/Zosyn and albuterol/ipratropium. He has a history of bleeding, including a slow GI bleed, and is anemic. He has a left femoral vein DVT and is not currently anticoagulated. He has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer and is being treated with TPN and wound care. He has type II diabetes and is being treated with insulin and a sliding scale. He has frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry, likely due to respiratory distress and anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his underlying lung disease and immunosuppressed state.
2. Sepsis: The patient's presumed diagnosis of HAP/Aspiration PNA and his immunosuppressed state make him susceptible to sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding, including a slow GI bleed, and his anemia make him at risk for further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left femoral vein DVT and his immobility due to his decubitus ulcer increase his risk for further DVT formation.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's presumed diagnosis of HAP/Aspiration PNA and his underlying lung disease make him susceptible to further pneumonia development.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia and bleeding history make him at risk for further anemia and its complications, including decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and his current immobility due to his decubitus ulcer make him at risk for further malnutrition and its complications, including decreased immune function and wound healing.
8. Wound Complications: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer and his immobility make him at risk for further wound complications, including infection and dehiscence.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's presumed diagnosis of HAP/Aspiration PNA with vanc/Zosyn and albuterol/ipratropium.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and continue to provide transfusions as needed.
4. Consider starting heparin to prevent further DVT formation.
5. Continue to provide wound care and consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider referring him to a nutritionist.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide replacement therapy as needed.
8. Consider restarting beta blocker therapy if the patient's blood pressure is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula with an ABG result of 7.55/25/77, indicating respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia. He has a history of multifocal pneumonia and aspiration.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction (MI). He has frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry, likely due to respiratory distress and anemia.
* Hematology: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), with a hemoglobin level of 87 g/dL. He has received two units of packed red blood cells (RBC) yesterday, which stabilized his hemoglobin level to 28%.
* Neurological: The patient has delirium and confusion, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions and respiratory distress.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has ulcerative colitis, which is being treated with chronic immunosuppression. He has a history of bloody bowel movements and is likely to require a colectomy.
* Orthopedic: The patient has a left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with heparin.
* Wound care: The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer and is receiving wound care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and frequent PVCs may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's acute anemia and bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic complications.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ulcerative colitis and bloody bowel movements may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding.
* Wound complications: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.

In terms of the patient's plan of care, the following are recommended:

* Continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA.
* Continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema.
* Watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
* Continue tapering immunosuppression for ulcerative colitis.
* Continue wound care for stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer.
* Continue TPN for nutrition.
* Hold PO meds (vitamin C, zinc) and consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable.
* Monitor electrolytes and consider restarting statin therapy if LDL levels are low.
* Consult with speech and swallow therapy to address witnessed aspiration.
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and consider IVC filter placement if persistent bleeding occurs."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia/Possible PNA: Required 95% high flow after witnessed aspiration
   but now back to 60%; previous CT consistant with multifocal pneumonia
   and aspiration.  Also concern for immunosuppressed state given chronic
   steroid use.  ABG with continued respiratory alkalosis.
   - consider switch vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  continue w/ bloody bowel movement with
   HCT drop.

   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.  INR elevated but
   trending down (1.7)
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (92-120 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 141/51 mmHg (69-112 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (19-37 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 98%
* ABG: 7.55/25/77 (pH, pCO2, pO2)

The patient has a history of aspiration, and his CT scan is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and aspiration. He is also at risk for immunosuppressed state due to chronic steroid use.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28%
* Platelet count: 120,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 3.9 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 40 mg/dL
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Methylprednisolone
* Albuterol
* Ipratropium
* TPN with lipids

The patient's plan includes:

* Switching to a different antibiotic for hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia
* Continuing albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
* Attempting to obtain a sputum culture
* Watching for fatigue given continued respiratory distress
* Continuing TPN and monitoring for nutrition
* Continuing methylprednisolone for presumed ulcerative colitis
* Monitoring for acute blood loss and considering transfusion
* Continuing to hold coumadin and monitoring for DVT
* Monitoring for NSCLC and considering radiation therapy
* Continuing TPN for nutrition and monitoring for decubitus ulcers
* Monitoring for CAD and considering beta blocker therapy
* Monitoring for type II diabetes and adjusting insulin therapy as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to aspiration and pneumonia
* Sepsis due to hospital-acquired pneumonia and immunosuppressed state
* Bleeding due to acute blood loss and coagulopathy
* Decubitus ulcers due to prolonged immobility
* Worsening of CAD due to stress and anemia
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Electrolyte imbalances due to TPN and medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include hypoxemia, respiratory distress, GI bleed, and anemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is receiving treatment for pneumonia with antibiotics, and the GI bleed appears to have slowed.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with persistent tachypnea and acute respiratory alkalosis. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, but the degree to which anxiety is contributing to their acute respiratory alkalosis is unclear.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with a heart rate of 104 bpm and a blood pressure of 157/98 mmHg. The patient's cardiac rhythm is normal sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and the patient has received two units of packed red blood cells. The patient's platelet count is trending downward.

The patient's imaging studies show significant diffuse emphysema, patchy infiltrates in the right upper and lower lobes, and atelectasis and effusion in the left lower lobe.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia, attempting to ambulate to a chair, and maintaining off coumadin for now. The patient will start heparin therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis, and the goal PTT will be 60.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition via total parenteral nutrition (TPN), glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and GI bleed can worsen, leading to bleeding complications such as hypovolemic shock or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and GI bleed can lead to secondary infections, such as sepsis or septic shock.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's TPN and glycemic control can lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, or metabolic acidosis.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's heparin therapy can lead to thrombotic complications such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium can worsen, leading to increased anxiety, agitation, or even respiratory failure.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
9. GI complications: The patient's GI bleed can lead to GI complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac rhythm can worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrest or cardiac failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute anemia, and impaired skin integrity. He is on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and has a history of bleeding. The patient has also been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and has a CT scan consistent with multifocal pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 38.3°C (101°F)
* P: 88 bpm
* RR: 29 breaths/min
* SpO2: 93%
* BP: 91/53 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.8 K/uL
* Hct: 21.9%
* Plt: 87 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22 mmHg
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL

The patient is on the following medications:

* Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
* Albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
* Methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID for ulcerative colitis
* TPN for nutrition
* Heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying lung disease and the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and the lack of adequate treatment.
* Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen due to his underlying disease and the risk of pressure ulcers.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may worsen due to his underlying lung disease and the risk of further aspiration.
* DVT: The patient's DVT may worsen due to his underlying disease and the risk of further clotting.
* CAD: The patient's CAD may worsen due to his underlying disease and the risk of further cardiac events.
* Type II diabetes: The patient's Type II diabetes may worsen due to his underlying disease and the risk of further complications.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, acute, intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure
* Marked tachypnea, increasing tachycardia, and delirium
* Hypotension, requiring levophed and fluids
* Meets ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Anxiety
* Ulcerative colitis, c/o BRBPR/hematochezia, on chronic immunosuppression without relief
* DVT, left femoral vein, and had been on coumadin
* NSCLC, s/p resection, stable
* Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus
* CAD, s/p MI, frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry
* Type II diabetes, 37 units regular insulin in TPN, TID sliding scale

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, or even death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture are pending, and the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out.
3. Bleeding: The patient's INR is sub-therapeutic, and the use of heparin gtt may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is acute and secondary to blood loss, which can lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, or even death.
5. Skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers, skin breakdown, or even sepsis.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety can exacerbate his respiratory distress, increase his heart rate and blood pressure, and lead to further complications.
7. DVT: The patient's DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
8. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC can progress and lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, bleeding, or even death.
9. CAD: The patient's CAD can lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or even death.
10. Type II diabetes: The patient's Type II diabetes can lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or even death.

Based on the patient's current condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes
2. Monitor blood, sputum, and urine cultures for signs of sepsis
3. Continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
4. Add Levofloxacin
5. Continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
6. Monitor electrolytes and continue TPN
7. Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
8. Consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
9. Continue telemetry and monitor for PVCs and tachycardia
10. Consider restarting aspirin if BP stable
11. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed
12. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust therapy as needed
13. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and adjust therapy as needed
14. Continue to monitor the patient's anxiety and adjust therapy as needed
15. Continue to monitor the patient's DVT and adjust therapy as needed
16. Continue to monitor the patient's NSCLC and adjust therapy as needed
17. Continue to monitor the patient's CAD and adjust therapy as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now meets ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Heparin gtt, protonix
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Aspiration Pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Delirium and confusion
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Anxiety
* Metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia
* Anion-gap acidosis (etiology unclear)
* Ulcerative colitis with bloody bowel movement and hematochezia
* Left femoral vein Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
* Thrombocytopenia (likely related to infection or Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC))
* Non-small cell lung cancer with hydropneumothorax
* Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus
* Coronary artery disease with frequent PVCs and tachycardia
* Type II Diabetes
* Malnutrition

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued respiratory failure and ARDS
* Hemorrhage or bleeding due to anemia and impaired skin integrity
* Infection or sepsis due to thrombocytopenia and anemia
* Further deterioration of skin integrity and wound care issues
* Cardiac complications due to coronary artery disease and tachycardia
* Nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition
* Further complications related to non-small cell lung cancer and hydropneumothorax
* DVT and pulmonary embolism
* Thrombocytopenia and DIC

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes
* Pressure support for ventilation
* Weaning of levophed as tolerated
* Boluses of LR for metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia
* Continued vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
* Addition of Levofloxacin
* Monitoring of blood, sputum, and urine cultures
* Continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
* Recheck lactate and monitor lytes
* Q8 Hct checks
* Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
* Continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
* GI following
* Continue TPN
* Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
* Consider IVC filter if persistent bleeding
* Monitor thrombocytopenia and transfuse if less than 10
* Continue telemetry and consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
* Statin held during this admission due to low LDL and malnutrition
* Type II Diabetes management with sliding scale insulin and TPN
* Wound care and nutrition management
* Monitor electrolytes and reconsult speech and swallow if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, and type II diabetes. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 of 110. He has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA and has been started on the ARDSnet protocol. The patient also has anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which carries a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which may require further transfusions.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of sedatives.
5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of sedatives.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of medications.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of medications.
8. DVT: The patient has a left femoral vein DVT, which may require further treatment.
9. NSCLC: The patient has non-small cell lung cancer, which may require further treatment.
10. CAD: The patient has coronary artery disease, which may require further treatment.
11. Type II diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, which may require further treatment.
12. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has ulcerative colitis, which may require further treatment.

Overall, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical comorbidities and potential complications. Further treatment and monitoring are necessary to manage the patient's condition and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, ARDS, anemia, and GI bleed. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume set at 6-8 mL/kg per ARDSnet protocol.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 97/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 58,000/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.8
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 21 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's radiology results show bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are consistent with ARDS.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Delirium/confusion
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Anxiety
* ARDS
* Pneumonia

The plan includes restarting stress dose steroids, weaning norepinephrine, and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient will also receive 2 units of blood transfusion today due to a low hemoglobin level.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia progression and worsening respiratory failure
* ARDS progression and worsening respiratory failure
* Anemia worsening and potential need for further transfusions
* GI bleed worsening and potential need for further interventions
* Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's hypotension and tachycardia
* Neurological complications due to the patient's delirium and confusion
* Skin integrity complications due to the patient's impaired skin integrity

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   BRPBR: Patient had two episodes BRBPR o/n losing approximately 1 L
   fluid and is s/p 2U PRBC. Appropriate Hct improvement. Gi aware
   - Continue to trend Hct
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Heparin gtt, protonix
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: SOB
   24 Hour Events:
   - HCT dropped to 22 in AM.  Pt recieved 2U RBC and bumped
   appropriately.
   - Started on stress dose steroids in the event his hypotension was
   related.  Was also thought to be possible treatment for non-infectious
   pulm process, as pt had failed to improve on abx.
   - Became tachycardic in the afternoon- responded to 1L saline.
   - Difficult to syncronize the patient to the vent, as he keeps
   overbreathing with high minute ventilation.  Lavage with ? clot.
   - Spoke with the patient's family and the patient was made DNR.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has been intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has had two episodes of bloody respiratory bronchial pneumonia (BRBPR) overnight, requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells. He has also had a drop in hemoglobin from 28 to 22, which has been transfused.

The patient's condition is complicated by anion-gap acidosis, likely due to metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia. He has a history of ulcerative colitis, which has led to bloody bowel movements and a drop in hemoglobin. The patient also has a left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has been on coumadin, which has been held. He has thrombocytopenia, likely related to infection, and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is likely to worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen, leading to further complications such as tachycardia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
5. Anion-Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
6. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis may lead to further complications such as toxic megacolon, perforation, or hemorrhage.
7. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient's non-small cell lung cancer may progress, leading to further complications such as pleural effusion or respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath (SOB). The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level dropped to 22% in the morning and received 2 units of red blood cells (RBCs). The patient was started on stress dose steroids to treat potential non-infectious pulmonary process and to address hypotension.

The patient experienced tachycardia in the afternoon, which responded to 1 liter of saline. The patient's ventilation was difficult to synchronize, with high minute ventilation and overbreathing. The patient's family was informed of his poor prognosis, and he was made DNR (do not resuscitate).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 58 K/uL and a hematocrit of 21.9%. The patient's white blood cell count is 6.6 K/uL, and his platelet count is 58 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with a alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 223 mg/dL and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 60%. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 112 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 67 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination shows no significant findings. The patient's laboratory results also show elevated levels of troponin-T, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient's assessment and plan include delirium, anemia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, anxiety, and ICU care. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypovolemic shock due to anemia and blood loss.
2. Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other pulmonary complications.
3. Cardiac complications due to possible cardiac injury and decreased cardiac output.
4. Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
5. Delirium and anxiety due to the patient's critical illness and the presence of sedatives and other medications.
6. Impaired skin integrity due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's anemia and the presence of stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n). Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress dosed steroids
   for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since stress dose
   steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus
   Code:  DNR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: SOB
   24 Hour Events:
   - HCT dropped to 22 in AM.  Pt recieved 2U RBC and bumped
   appropriately.
   - D/c hep gtt
   - Started on stress dose steroids in the event his hypotension was
   related.  Was also thought to be possible treatment for non-infectious
   pulm process, as pt had failed to improve on abx.
   - Became tachycardic in the afternoon- responded to 1L saline.
   - Difficult to syncronize the patient to the vent, as he keeps
   overbreathing with high minute ventilation.  Lavage with ? clot.
   - Spoke with the patient's family and the patient was made DNR.
   - Had 2 BRBPR since midnight requiring 2U RBC; GI made aware

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

**Respiratory Status:** The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation with a high minute ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% and PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 112, indicating ARDS. The patient's respiratory support is being managed with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.

**Cardiovascular Status:** The patient is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, and has been treated with stress dose steroids for hypotension. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and non-small cell lung cancer.

**Hematological Status:** The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient's platelet count is 58 K/uL, and the patient has a history of thrombocytopenia.

**Gastrointestinal Status:** The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The patient has developed bleeding from the rectum and has been treated with vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA.

**Infectious Status:** The patient has been treated with antibiotics for HAP/Aspiration PNA, and has received a stress dose of steroids for possible non-infectious pulmonary process.

**Other Complications:** The patient has developed an anion-gap acidosis, which is unclear in etiology. The patient has also developed a DVT in the left femoral vein and has been treated with heparin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the patient is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and the patient is at risk of developing further hypotension.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has developed bleeding from the rectum, and the patient is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for HAP/Aspiration PNA, but the patient is at risk of developing further infections.
5. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis is unclear in etiology, and the patient is at risk of developing further acidosis.
6. DVT: The patient has developed a DVT in the left femoral vein, and the patient is at risk of developing further thrombotic complications.

**Plan:**

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Continue stress dose steroids for hypotension and possible non-infectious pulmonary process.
3. Continue antibiotics for HAP/Aspiration PNA.
4. Monitor the patient's anion-gap acidosis and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's DVT and consider further treatment if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider further treatment if necessary.
8. Consider bronchoscopy for samples to rule out PCP.
9. Consider weaning levophed as tolerated.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider further treatment if necessary."

   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n) and now Hct 27. Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress
   dosed steroids for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since
   stress dose steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tacypnea. He is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with a drop in hemoglobin from 21.9 to 22, and he has required multiple blood transfusions. He has also developed an anion-gap acidosis, which is unclear in etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires continued mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes to prevent further lung injury.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic status is uncertain, and he may be at risk for further organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss and may require continued transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to infection or DIC and requires continued monitoring and transfusion if necessary.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to adrenal insufficiency, hypovolemia, or a combination of both and requires continued monitoring and treatment.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's anion-gap acidosis and hypernatremia may indicate acute kidney injury, which requires continued monitoring and treatment.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and he requires continued treatment with stress dose steroids and proton pump inhibitors.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's deep vein thrombosis is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism and requires continued anticoagulation therapy.
9. Wound infection: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer is at risk for infection and requires continued wound care and monitoring.
10. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry may indicate cardiac instability and require continued monitoring and treatment.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires continued ICU care with close monitoring and treatment of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status. The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is ICU care for now. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to address his anion-gap acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a range of medical conditions. They have been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives, and have undergone several procedures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 58. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.0 mmol/L, sodium level of 147 mmol/L, and chloride level of 121 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes a history of bleeding and blood loss, which has led to anemia. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding and blood loss: The patient's history of bleeding and blood loss increases the risk of further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and anemia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia increases the risk of further complications, including cardiovascular instability and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of further complications, including infection and tissue necrosis.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety increases the risk of further complications, including agitation, delirium, and increased heart rate and blood pressure.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium increases the risk of further complications, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, and decreased cognitive function.
7. ICU-acquired weakness: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing ICU-acquired weakness, which can lead to prolonged recovery and increased risk of complications.
8. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infection.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's anemia and respiratory failure increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias."

   -          Active T&C
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss. On
   stress dose steroids for AI. Unclear source of infection
 no positive
   cultures.  Possibly due to aspiration pneumonia.
   -          Levophed for MAP > 60
   -          Stress dose steroids
   -          F/U cultures
   -          Will consider bronch
   Ulcerative Colitis:  On Chronic immunosuppression without releif (now
   tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery following as
   patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical candidate now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. He is receiving antibiotics (Vanc/zosyn/levo) and has low airway pressures and good lung compliance, which is not consistent with ARDS. The patient has a history of emphysema and is receiving albuterol and ipratropium.

The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) over the past 24 hours, indicating bleeding or acute ischemia. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is likely in septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is on chronic immunosuppression, which has not provided relief. He is likely to require colectomy but is not a surgical candidate at this time.

The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and has been on coumadin. He is currently on heparin gtt and will need to continue this therapy. The patient also has a PICC line, arterial line, and a 20-gauge line.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. His blood cultures are negative, and he has no clear source of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Bleeding: The patient's low hemoglobin concentration and history of bleeding complications increase the risk of further bleeding.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely in septic shock, and there is a risk of further organ dysfunction or death.
4. Infection: The patient's negative blood cultures do not rule out the possibility of infection, and there is a risk of further infection.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of DVT and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding or coagulopathy.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and bleeding complications increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and septic shock increase the risk of cardiac complications.

In summary, this patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and a high risk of medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely aspiration.
* Bradycardia: Heart rate of 99 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm.
* Hypotension: MAP of 67 mmHg, likely due to septic shock worsened by acute blood loss.
* Bradypnea: Respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute.
* Oxygenation: SpO2 of 92%, with a FiO2 of 60% and a PEEP of 7 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamics: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min.
* Coagulopathy: PT/PTT/INR of 15.2/32.4/1.3, indicating a prolonged bleeding risk.
* Gastrointestinal: BRBPR with decreasing Hct, possibly due to acute ischemia or bleeding.
* Infections: Unclear source of infection, with no positive cultures.
* Other issues: Left femoral vein DVT, on coumadin hold, and on heparin gtt.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to aspiration pneumonia or sepsis.
* Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to BRBPR or acute ischemia.
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding or thrombotic events.
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or endocarditis.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypotension, sepsis, or medications.
* Hepatic failure or acute liver injury due to sepsis, medications, or liver disease.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Intensive care unit (ICU) care with close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters.
* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Cardiovascular support with norepinephrine infusion and stress dose steroids.
* Gastrointestinal support with TPN, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Infection control measures, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, as indicated.
* DVT prophylaxis with heparin gtt and compression boots.
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.
* VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is ICU care for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has a history of GIB, and his current condition is complicated by ARDS, hypotension, and anion-gap acidosis. He is on mechanical ventilation, and his oxygen requirements are being met with a FiO2 of 60%. His hemodynamic status is stable, but he has decreased blood pressure and is receiving vasopressor support. He has also developed a left femoral vein DVT and is on coumadin. His laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and current bleeding episodes increase the risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and metabolic acidosis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is complicated by bilateral infiltrates on CXR, long-standing steroid use, and the possibility of PCP. This increases the risk of respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, or a combination of both. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
4. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis is unclear in etiology, and its resolution is uncertain. This increases the risk of metabolic acidosis, which can lead to cardiac and neurological dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to infection, DIC, or a combination of both. This increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of GIB and ARDS.
6. DVT: The patient's left femoral vein DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
7. Infection: The patient's history of GIB, ARDS, and DVT increases the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition, increases the risk of impaired wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his hemodynamic status, respiratory function, and laboratory results to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on pressure control ventilation (PCV) with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% and ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 110, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CXR and is at risk for pulmonary complications, including pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and non-small cell lung cancer. The patient's heart rate is 97 bpm, and blood pressure is 104/54 mmHg. The patient has a history of hypotension, which may be related to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) or adrenal insufficiency.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The patient has had four episodes of melanotic stool since morning, and the Hct is trending down. The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and may require colectomy.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely related to infection or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's platelet count is 25 K/uL.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonitis.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and not responsive, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, indicating mild renal impairment.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 117 mEq/L, potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L, and calcium level is 6.7 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and hypoxemia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding and risk of further bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potential need for transfusions.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and risk of further infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, and potential need for antimicrobial therapy.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and potential adrenal insufficiency may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and potential need for vasopressors.
5. Renal impairment: The patient's mild renal impairment may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and potential need for dialysis.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's sedation and potential neurological damage may lead to further neurological deterioration, including brain edema and potential need for surgical intervention.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and risk of further thrombotic complications may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pulmonary embolism, and potential need for anticoagulant therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer.
* He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
* He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
* He has a left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has been on coumadin, which has been held due to GIB.
* He has a history of anemia and is currently receiving blood transfusions.
* He has a history of cardiac disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and is currently on beta blockers.
* He has a history of diabetes and is currently receiving insulin and sliding scale insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to the patient's history of ulcerative colitis and prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of DVT and prolonged immobility.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Infection due to the patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy and prolonged hospitalization.
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous MI.
* Anemia due to the patient's history of chronic bleeding and ongoing blood loss.
* Metabolic acidosis due to the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential electrolyte imbalances.
* Hypernatremia due to the patient's history of diabetes insipidus and potential electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to assess for any changes in his condition.
* Consider bronchoscopy to rule out pneumonia and other respiratory infections.
* Consider restarting heparin without bolus for DVT prophylaxis.
* Consider restarting beta blockers if the patient's blood pressure is stable.
* Consider restarting statins if the patient's lipid profile is abnormal.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as necessary.
* Consider transfer to a floor bed if the patient's condition stabilizes and he is no longer requiring ICU-level care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health status is as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, delirium, and anxiety. The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including mechanical ventilation, blood transfusions, and medication administration.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and a hematocrit of 25.9%. The patient's platelet count is 46,000/μL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated calcium level of 9.01 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for bleeding, which has led to acute anemia. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and the patient is at risk for developing skin breakdown.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with acute respiratory failure and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 27 cmH2O.

The patient's neurological status is impaired, with evidence of delirium and confusion. The patient's anxiety level is high, and the patient is at risk for developing anxiety-related complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's bleeding history and ongoing blood loss increase the risk of further bleeding, which can lead to acute anemia, hypovolemic shock, and even death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure can worsen, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and even respiratory arrest.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown, which can lead to infections, sepsis, and even death.
4. Delirium and confusion: The patient's delirium and confusion can worsen, leading to increased anxiety, agitation, and even violent behavior.
5. Anxiety-related complications: The patient's high anxiety level can lead to anxiety-related complications, such as tachycardia, hypertension, and even cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infections: The patient's impaired skin integrity and respiratory status increase the risk of infections, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and even death.
7. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying medical conditions and ongoing bleeding can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, which can result in organ failure and even death.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical interventions. The patient's bleeding should be aggressively managed, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration. The patient's skin integrity should be maintained, and the patient should be monitored for signs of skin breakdown. The patient's delirium and confusion should be managed with pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, and the patient's anxiety level should be monitored and managed accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 104 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 91%

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, and anxiety. They are also at risk for aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary edema.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. They are also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and have a central line, arterial line, and peripheral intravenous (IV) lines in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 46
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mg/dL
* Glucose: 131 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Echocardiogram (ECHO) to evaluate cardiac function
* Bronchoscopy to evaluate respiratory status
* Continued broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Diuresis to manage fluid balance
* Placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Heparin therapy without bolus until the IVC filter is in place

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or ARDS
* Sepsis secondary to bacteremia or pneumonia
* Hemorrhagic shock due to ongoing bleeding
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased renal perfusion
* Cardiac arrest due to arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock
* Neurological complications such as seizures or stroke due to hypoxia or hypoperfusion
* Infection-related complications such as septic shock, abscesses, or osteomyelitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting. They have undergone various diagnostic procedures, including a trans-thoracic echo, angiography, and bronchoscopy. The patient has been diagnosed with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation, and a suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) syndrome, which has led to the discontinuation of heparin and initiation of argatroban. The patient has also been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, delirium, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has undergone various lab tests, including complete blood counts, liver function tests, and electrolyte panels, which have revealed abnormalities in their platelet count, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels. They have also undergone imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are at risk of developing further respiratory failure, particularly given their underlying lung disease and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and they have a history of bleeding, which increases their risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction or injury, which could lead to further complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's delirium, fever, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection, which could lead to further complications and organ dysfunction.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation increase their risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve their clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxic respiratory failure due to ARDS and aspiration pneumonia.
	* Pneumonia may be caused by PCP, HAP, or Aspiration PNA.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a potential complication.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Hypotension due to hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis.
	* Tachycardia and frequent PVCs may indicate cardiac instability.
	* CAD s/p MI with frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to ulcerative colitis and prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
	* BRBPR/hematochezia and bloody stools.
	* Possible colectomy may be necessary.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
	* Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to transfer.
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Possible PCP or HAP/Aspiration PNA.
	* Sepsis may occur due to GIB or pneumonia.
6. Metabolic Complications:
	* Anion-gap acidosis with unclear etiology.
	* Hypernatremia and metabolic acidosis.
	* Hypokalemia may occur due to diarrhea and vomiting.
7. Nutritional Complications:
	* Malnutrition due to prolonged hospitalization and lack of oral intake.
	* Hypoglycemia may occur due to insulin therapy and malnutrition.
8. Wound Complications:
	* Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer.
	* Wound care is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

The patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent these complications from arising or worsening."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Bronhoscopy performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to
   lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: D5W for maintenance given hypernatremia
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and there is a concern for hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, adrenal insufficiency is a possibility, especially given the patient's history of chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
2. ARDS: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, and they have developed bilateral infiltrates on their chest X-ray. This is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be related to aspiration pneumonia or other factors.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or other factors. The patient is being treated with argatroban, and further monitoring and testing are needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, with an anion gap acidosis. The etiology is unclear, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. DVT: The patient has a left femoral vein DVT, which is being treated with an IVC filter. However, there is a risk of bleeding and further complications.
6. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and has undergone resection. There is a risk of thrombosis in the setting of this cancer and its treatment.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, which may be contributing to their overall decline.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W. Further monitoring is needed to ensure that the patient's electrolyte status is stable.
9. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which may be related to their respiratory failure and the use of sedatives.
10. PCP: The patient has a history of long-term steroid use, which may increase their risk of developing pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's bilateral infiltrates on their chest X-ray are concerning for this possibility.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including respiratory failure, bleeding, infection, and malnutrition. Further evaluation and management are needed to address these concerns and improve the patient's outcomes."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: D5W for maintenance given hypernatremia
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tacypnea. The patient has a complicated course with DVT, BRBPR, and ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for hypovolemia, which can lead to hypotension.
2. ARDS: The patient has met ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110, and is at risk for further respiratory failure.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for further aspiration due to his intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. PCP: The patient has a history of long-standing steroid use and has bilateral infiltrates on CXR, which increases the risk of PCP.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 25 and is at risk for further bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia and is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis and is at risk for further acidosis due to his underlying condition.
8. DVT: The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and is at risk for further clotting due to his immobility and underlying condition.
9. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of thrombosis and is at risk for further thrombotic events due to his underlying condition.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk for further infection due to his underlying condition and immobility.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue to administer antibiotics and antifungal agents as prescribed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid and electrolyte management as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
7. Consider performing a bronchoscopy to rule out PCP and to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's DVT and consider anticoagulation therapy as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and consider surgical intervention as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his plan of care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   - Order Blood smear
   - Hem/Onc consult
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea, complicated by DVT and BRBPR. The patient has been on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and has a history of steroid use, which may have contributed to his respiratory distress.

The patient has been treated with vanc/zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA, and caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from sputum. He has also been started on argatroban for suspected HIT, and transfused with PRBCs.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His respiratory support includes a ventilator in pressure control ventilation mode, with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 70%.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Anion-gap acidosis, with an unclear etiology.
2. Thrombocytopenia, likely related to infection or HIT.
3. Hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or adrenal insufficiency.
4. DVT, with a left femoral vein DVT and an IVC filter in place.
5. ARDS, with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110.
6. Aspiration PNA, with a sputum culture growing Aspergillus.
7. Hypoxemia, with a need for high levels of oxygen support.
8. Type II diabetes, with a need for insulin therapy.
9. Malnutrition, with a need for nutritional support.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. WBC count: 5.7-5.3 x 10^9/L
2. Hct: 27.7-25.9%
3. Platelet count: 25-30 x 10^9/L
4. Cr: 0.4-0.4 mg/dL
5. TCO2: 25-28 mmHg
6. Glucose: 217-163 mg/dL
7. Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
8. Albumin: 1.2 g/dL
9. Ca++: 6.9 mg/dL
10. Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
11. PO4: 2.0 mg/dL

Based on the patient's medical complications and laboratory results, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory status, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock, potentially due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of Aspergillus in his sputum.
3. Progression of thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
4. Further decline in kidney function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Development of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, potentially due to the patient's diabetes and the need for insulin therapy.
6. Progression of malnutrition, potentially leading to further decline in the patient's overall health and quality of life.
7. Development of further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, potentially due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of Aspergillus in his sputum."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
