   Patient started on levophed, vasopressin. When these were maxed,
   started dopamine. Patient became tacchycardic with bigeminy. Switched
   to neo. HR back down to low 100s. Patient was bolused with IV NS (3
   liters) and D5W with 3 amps of bicarb (2 units) until CVPs were at goal
   [**7-12**] and lactate was stable/trending down. Patient oliguric. Patient
   anxious and in pain overnight. Received IV morphine and 1 mg IV ativan.
   Patient is alert and oriented x 3 but now making statements like ""can I
   leave the hospital today."" She feels swollen, diffuse arthralgias,
   warm. Rash is pruritic and bothering her esp when she was febrile. No
   chest or abdominal pain. Patient feels that her work of breathing is
   not worse but she is purse lip breathing.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo. Obstructive source such
   as PE possible given recent immobility secondary to illness.
   - PICC removed, culture pending
   -[**Hospital1 **] blood cx
   -consider TEE as TTE neg
   - Continue vancomycin therapy, broadened to included aztreonam and
   levaquin given worsening status
   - Continue to bolus with fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and MAP > 65
   - Continue pressors to acheive bp goals since cvp at goal
   - Mixed venous O2 sats > 70% and crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim negative, gave one dose steroids before this came back
   - Follow-up cultures and serologies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with oliguric renal failure. FENA is
   0.9. Has made 30 cc over the last 24 hours. UA without casts but
   positive rbcs. Urine eos pending. U/S without evidence of RAS or
   hydronephrosis. Likely ATN [**1-1**] sepsis, hypotension and early DIC.
   Electrolytes stable. Urine eos pending.
   - renal consult in am
   - f/u urine eos
   - bolus IV fluids: NS alternating with D5 with bicarb
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: could be due to sepsis as bandemia is
   increasing as well as early DIC as FDP, d-dimer, PTT, INR rising and
   fibrinogen falling.
   -cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   -consider onc consult
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy. To date, 1 out of
   2 blood cultures positive for GPCs in clusters and pairs. Additional 2
   blood cultures pending. Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia,
   rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies,
   malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given
   arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high
   ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **],
   Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology
   involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV,
   cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia, added aztreonam and levaquin
   overnight as patient still febrile and hypotensive on 3 pressors
   - d/c doxycycline
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs
   -consider steroids for possible vasculitis although renal failure more
   likely related to sepsis/dic physiology
   - consider onc consult for bm bx
   - Benadryl prn
   .
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   -trend lfts
   -f/[**Location 134**] [**Location (Universities) 1396**] u/s
   -f/u hep and other infectious serologies
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus: holding po meds
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   .
   #. FEN/GI - NPO sips okay, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for
   above goals
   .
   #. Prophylaxis - Pneumatic compression boots, no subq heparin given
   possibility of HIT, bowel regimen
   .
   #. Code status - Full code confirmed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. She has a history of allergy to Ceclor and has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. Her laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. She has also been diagnosed with transaminitis and is at risk for diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and rash suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and treatment.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, characterized by prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, is a potential complication of sepsis and requires close monitoring.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia, characterized by a platelet count of 59,000, is a potential complication of sepsis and requires close monitoring.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis, characterized by elevated liver enzymes, is a potential complication of sepsis and requires close monitoring.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's risk of developing diabetes mellitus is increased due to her underlying medical condition and the stress of her illness.
7. FEN/GI: The patient's FEN/GI (fatty liver and gastrointestinal) symptoms, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are potential complications of sepsis and require close monitoring.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient requires prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) to prevent these complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and treatment for sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and diabetes mellitus. She also requires prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and treatment plan, and a family meeting should be held to discuss her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo. Obstructive source such
   as PE possible given recent immobility secondary to illness.
   - PICC removed, culture pending
   -[**Hospital1 **] blood cx
   -consider TEE as TTE neg
   - Continue vancomycin therapy, broadened to included aztreonam and
   levaquin given worsening status
   - Continue to bolus with fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and MAP > 65
   - Continue pressors to acheive bp goals since cvp at goal
   - Mixed venous O2 sats > 70% and crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim negative, gave one dose steroids before this came back
   - Follow-up cultures and serologies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with oliguric renal failure. FENA is
   0.9. Has made 30 cc over the last 24 hours. UA without casts but
   positive rbcs. Urine eos pending. U/S without evidence of RAS or
   hydronephrosis. Likely ATN [**1-1**] sepsis, hypotension and early DIC.
   Electrolytes stable. Urine eos pending.
   - renal consult in am
   - f/u urine eos
   - bolus IV fluids: NS alternating with D5 with bicarb
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: could be due to sepsis as bandemia is
   increasing as well as early DIC as FDP, d-dimer, PTT, INR rising and
   fibrinogen falling.
   -cont to monitor [**Hospital1 **] DIC labs
   -consider onc consult
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy. To date, 1 out of
   2 blood cultures positive for GPCs in clusters and pairs. Additional 2
   blood cultures pending. Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia,
   rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies,
   malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given
   arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high
   ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **],
   Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology
   involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV,
   cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia, added aztreonam and levaquin
   overnight as patient still febrile and hypotensive on 3 pressors
   - Continue doxycycline empirically for tick borne illness
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs
   -consider steroids for possible vasculitis although renal failure more
   likely related to sepsis/dic physiology

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. She has developed hypotension and is receiving vasopressors. Her laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Her blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs, and she is being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and levaquin. She also has evidence of transaminitis and is being monitored for liver function. Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, and she is being treated with antibiotics. However, she is still febrile and hypotensive, which may indicate that the sepsis is not fully controlled.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is oliguric, and she has a high FENA. She is at risk for further renal damage if her blood pressure is not controlled.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of coagulopathy, which may be related to sepsis or early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She is at risk for bleeding if her coagulopathy is not managed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to sepsis or DIC. She is at risk for bleeding if her platelet count does not improve.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may be related to sepsis or another underlying condition. She is at risk for further liver damage if her transaminitis is not managed.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, which may be related to stress or another underlying condition. She is at risk for further hyperglycemia if her blood sugar levels are not managed.
7. FEN/GI: The patient's fluid balance is compromised, which may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and organ dysfunction if not managed.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer bleeding, and prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent these complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation to ensure that her sepsis is being controlled.
2. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with fluid boluses and diuretics as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, and consider transfusing platelets if her platelet count does not improve.
4. Monitor the patient's transaminitis and consider further testing if her liver function tests do not improve.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes mellitus with sliding scale insulin and monitor her blood sugar levels regularly.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels, and consider further testing if her electrolyte levels are not within normal limits.
7. Continue to provide prophylactic measures to prevent DVT and stress ulcer bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
    .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.1, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 60, and creatinine of 4.7 mg/dL. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and doxycycline, and has received cryoprecipitate for her coagulopathy. She has also been started on Xigris (drotrecogin) and Solumedrol (methylprednisolone) for her DIC and possible Still's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive sepsis and septic shock: The patient's sepsis is worsening, and she is at risk of developing septic shock, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and she requires invasive ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. She is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Coagulopathy and bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy is severe, and she is at risk of bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding into her joints.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and she is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI), which could lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is worsening, and she is at risk of developing severe acidosis, which could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is severe, and she is at risk of developing shock, which could lead to organ failure and death.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is severe, and she is at risk of bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding into her joints.
8. Possible Still's disease: The patient's symptoms, including fever, rash, and arthralgias, are consistent with Still's disease, a type of inflammatory arthritis. If this diagnosis is confirmed, the patient may require treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.
9. Possible infection: The patient's symptoms, including fever and rash, are consistent with infection. If an infection is confirmed, the patient may require treatment with antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.
10. Possible malignancy: The patient's symptoms, including fever and rash, are consistent with malignancy. If a malignancy is confirmed, the patient may require treatment with chemotherapy and other cancer therapies.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis and respiratory failure with antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation.
3. Consider adding immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, to the patient's treatment regimen if her symptoms persist or worsen.
4. Consider referring the patient to a rheumatologist or other specialist for further evaluation and treatment of her symptoms.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk, and consider adding platelet transfusions or other therapies as necessary.
6. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and treatment of her acute kidney injury.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and consider adding bicarbonate therapy or other treatments as necessary.
8. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment of her hypotension.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and consider adding platelet transfusions or other therapies as necessary.
10. Consider referring the patient to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment of her rash."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source - less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Vancomycin trough this AM XXXX.  As patient with rapidly changing
   renal function, will continue to monitor levels and dose accordingly.
   - Given concern of Still's, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days started
   ([**1-2**]).
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures.  PICC tip prelim no growth.
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and MAP > 65
   - Continue pressors to acheive bp goals since cvp at goal. Wean
   phenylephrine if possible.
   - Mixed venous O2 sats > 70% and crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   - Follow-up cultures and serologies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with oliguric renal failure. FENA is
   0.9. UOP has increased to 240cc/24 hours. UA without casts but positive
   rbcs. Negative urine eosinophils. U/S without evidence of RAS or
   hydronephrosis. Likely ATN [**1-1**] sepsis, hypotension and early DIC.
   Electrolytes stable.
   - Appreciate renal recs. Will follow-up regarding potential for CVVH.
   - Bolus IVF
   .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: could be due to sepsis as bandemia is
   increasing as well as early DIC as FDP, d-dimer, PTT, INR rising and
   fibrinogen falling.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood
   cultures positive from [**8-30**] with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture
   positive for GPC in pairs and clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative.
   Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and
   c serologies, malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here.
   Given arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given
   high ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on differential.
   [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology
   involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV,
   cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia added meropenem as
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.
   .
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   -trend lfts
   -f/[**Location 134**] [**Location (Universities) 1396**] u/s
   -f/u hep and other infectious serologies
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus: holding po meds
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   .
   #. FEN/GI - NPO, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for above goals
   .
   #. Prophylaxis - Pneumatic compression boots, no subq heparin given
   possibility of HIT, bowel regimen
   .
   #. Code status - Full code confirmed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source - less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Vancomycin trough this AM XXXX.  As patient with rapidly changing
   renal function, will continue to monitor levels and dose accordingly.
   - Given concern of Still's, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days started
   ([**1-2**]).
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures.  PICC tip prelim no growth.
   - TEE recommended per ID

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old female who was admitted with a fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. She has developed sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus, and her blood cultures from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) are also positive. She has been started on meropenem and vancomycin, and has been given Xigris (drotrecogin alfa) for DIC. She has also been started on solumedrol for possible Still's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications and organ failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to acute kidney injury and end-stage renal disease.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to shock and multi-organ failure.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications and organ failure.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to liver failure and coagulopathy.
9. Fever: The patient's fever is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
10. Rash: The patient's rash is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to skin breakdown and infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC with antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider initiating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulation studies closely and consider administering fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function closely and consider administering N-acetylcysteine (NAC) if necessary.
6. Consider initiating stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Consider initiating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux to reduce the risk of DVT.
8. Consider initiating stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Consider initiating anticonvulsant therapy with phenytoin or levetiracetam to reduce the risk of seizures.
10. Consider initiating antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir to reduce the risk of viral infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
    .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
    .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.
   .
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient Condition:**

* Sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Fever, rash, arthralgias, and an unknown origin
* Acute renal failure, with creatinine rising to 4.7 mg/dL
* Hypotension, requiring vasopressors
* Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Transaminitis, with elevated liver enzymes
* Diabetes mellitus, with hyperglycemia

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's sepsis is likely to be caused by a bacterial infection, with coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) isolated from blood cultures. The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pneumonia or another respiratory infection.
2. **DIC:** The patient's DIC is likely to be caused by the sepsis, and may lead to thrombosis formation, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.
3. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and need for renal replacement therapy.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, or bleeding at surgical sites.
5. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of coagulopathy.
6. **Transaminitis:** The patient's transaminitis may be caused by a viral or other infectious process, and may lead to liver dysfunction and encephalopathy.
7. **Diabetes Mellitus:** The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen if not controlled, leading to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and other complications.
8. **Fever and Rash:** The patient's fever and rash may be caused by a variety of conditions, including sepsis, rheumatologic disease, or an allergic reaction.
9. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.

**Plan:**

* Continue antibiotics for sepsis, including vancomycin and meropenem
* Monitor for signs of DIC, including bleeding, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction
* Continue to manage acute renal failure, including fluid management and electrolyte replacement
* Monitor for signs of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, including bleeding and bruising
* Continue to manage transaminitis, including liver enzyme monitoring and consideration of antiviral therapy
* Monitor for signs of diabetes mellitus, including hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis
* Continue to manage fever and rash, including consideration of antiviral therapy and skin biopsy
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure, including hypoxemia and hypercapnia"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  Has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets on
   different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however, for
   coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.  PICC culture negative.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM (vanc
   trough 19.6)
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-31**])
   - TEE recommended per ID, to be done on Monday
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   stable around 4.6.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
 will likely need it today
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH
 infuse platelets
   prior to/during placement
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 5 units of cryo. Per heme-onc, will transfuse
   cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250. This morning fibrinogen 95
 will
   transfuse 2 units cryo.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, and now torso region as well. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy (catastrophic APLA
   syndrome vs. lymphoma vs. Still
s disease vs. hemophagocytic
   lymphangiohistiocytosis). Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  All other blood cultures negative Urine culture, LP
   negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv,
   hep b and c serologies, malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending
   here. Given arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility -
   given high ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on
   differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID,
   rheumatology involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious
   hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins. Skin biopsy results nonspecific
   (thrombosed vessels)
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Zygress discontinued [**1-1**] concern that catastrophic APLA syndrome is
   more likely.
   - Continue solumedrol today, day [**1-31**].
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 today
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.
   # Transaminitis- Elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   - Trend lfts
   - F/u hep and other infectious serologies; HCV (-), HBV viral load
   pending
   #. Diabetes mellitus: Holding po meds. Blood glucose elevated, likely
   secondary to high-dose steroids
 given limited access, will have to
   hold on insulin sliding scale.
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   #. FEN/GI - NPO, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for above goals
   #. Prophylaxis
 Heparin drip
 held this morning in anticipation of
   bone marrow biopsy, bowel regimen
   #. Code status - Full code confirmed
   #. Access - PIV, RIJ, left radial arterial line, FC
   #. Communication: with husband and sister, numbers in chart and pt's
   room
   # Dispo: ICU level of care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
    Uric acid elevated. Given this finding + hypocalcemia and
   hyperphosphatemia, concern for tumor lysis. CT chest checked to assess
   for lymphoma - preliminary report negative (1. Right adnexal dermoid.
   2. Pulmonary edema. 3. Right anterior chest wall subcutaneous soft
   tissue stranding and asymmetry. 4. Pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes and
   axillary lymph nodes measuring up to
   1.5 cm), final report pending.
   - CT head without contrast, preliminary read - Subtle loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white matter differentiation and effacement of sulci consistent
   with mild edema. No significant change.
   - Per ID recs, d/c'd clindamycin and started ivermectin in case she has
   reactivation of strongyloides on high dose steroids (strongyloides IgG
   antibody pending)
   - Stopped Zygris (treating sepsis) given that antiphospholipid antibody
   syndrome may be more likely - started heparin drip
   - Several cultures and serologies pending
   - Got cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 250
   - Fevers to 103.5, called blood bank and they said it's okay to still
   give the cryoprecipitate
   ** Needs C3, C4 48 hours from start of solumedrol
   - Renal recs - Place CVVHD catheter [**9-4**] given Zygris and 3 pressors;
   added bicarb

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a complex medical condition characterized by fever, rash, arthralgias, sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has undergone extensive workup, including blood cultures, urinalysis, and radiological studies, with no clear source of infection identified.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated uric acid levels, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, which are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's CT chest scan showed pulmonary edema, right anterior chest wall subcutaneous soft tissue stranding and asymmetry, and enlarged lymph nodes. The patient's CT head scan showed subtle loss of white matter differentiation and effacement of sulci consistent with mild edema.

The patient's medical history is significant for strongyloides IgG antibody pending, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and possible Still's disease. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and doxycycline, and has been treated with heparin and vasopressin for DIC.

The patient's current medications include solumedrol, pantoprazole, and midazolam, and the patient has been placed on a heparin drip for prophylaxis against DVT. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 111 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL and a potassium level of 4.6 mmol/L. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a total bilirubin level of 3.5 mg/dL and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 301 IU/L.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and the patient may require further interventions to support renal function.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's DIC may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and the patient may require further interventions to support liver function.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and the patient may require further interventions to support cardiovascular function.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's mild edema on CT head scan may worsen, leading to further neurological complications.

In summary, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple comorbidities and potential complications. Further close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   -trend lfts
   -f/[**Location 134**] [**Location (Universities) 1396**] u/s

   #. Diabetes mellitus: holding po meds
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   #. FEN/GI - NPO, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for above goals
   #. Prophylaxis - Pneumatic compression boots, no subq heparin given

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a complex and evolving clinical picture. The patient is currently in the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, transaminitis, and possible Still's disease.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DIC, with a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and a decreased fibrinogen level. The patient's platelet count is also low, and the patient has received multiple units of cryoprecipitate to help correct the coagulopathy.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a need for mechanical ventilation and a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's cardiac status is also tenuous, with a need for vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent admission with fever, rash, and arthralgias, and the patient has undergone an extensive workup with no clear source of infection identified. The patient's differential diagnosis includes rheumatologic disease, infectious disease, and malignancy.

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and supportive care. The patient is also receiving corticosteroids to help manage her respiratory status and possible Still's disease.

Potential medical complications that could arise in this patient include:

1. Progression of DIC: The patient's DIC is severe, and it is possible that it could worsen, leading to further bleeding and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and it is possible that she could develop further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is tenuous, and it is possible that she could develop cardiac arrest, especially if her vasopressors are discontinued.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is already impaired, and it is possible that she could develop further renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and possible GI disease could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
6. Sepsis-related organ failure: The patient's sepsis could lead to further organ failure, including hepatic, renal, and cardiac failure.
7. Malignancy: The patient's underlying malignancy could progress, leading to further complications and poor outcomes.

In conclusion, this patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CT-head official read:
   Persistent effacement of sulci with poor [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white matter
   differentiation, likely due to mild cerebral edema. The temporal horns
   of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle have slightly
   decreased size, concerning for subtle increase in intracranial
   pressure. Clinical correlation and close follow-up are recommended. MRI
   would also be helpful for further evaluation.
   -Pt continues to be on 3 pressors with labile pressures --> MAP went
   into the 50's and 60's.  Pt given IVF 1.5L, maxed out on levophed &
   vasopressin.  Considering starting epi drip if patient is maxed out on
   neo.
   Renal: HD cath placed in R femoral --> patient started on CVVH. If
   patient tolerates will call blood bank to start plasma exhange.
   ID: unable to account for septic presentation based on coag neg staph,
   possible other source --> check bacterial/fungal/AFB stain.

   Addendum:
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1119**] spoke with the patient
s sister, who is the HCP this
   morning, and was informed that the family is moving towards CMO.  We
   continue current therapies while a final decision is made and family
   members are assembled.  However, we will hold off on additional lab
   test, imaging, and procedures in the mean time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a complex medical condition, including sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has a history of fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin, and has recently been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by coag-negative Staphylococcus. She is currently receiving treatment in the ICU, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient's dependence on vasopressors and her history of sepsis and DIC increase her risk of developing shock and hypotension.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's anuric renal failure, worsening creatinine levels, and metabolic acidosis suggest a high risk of acute renal failure.
3. Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's DIC and thrombocytopenia increase her risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia, suboptimal hemoglobin level, and history of bleeding suggest a high risk of anemia.
5. Fever/Rash/Arthralgias: The patient's persistent fever, rash, and arthralgias suggest a high risk of ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
6. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and history of shock liver suggest a high risk of liver dysfunction.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and history of steroid use suggest a high risk of developing diabetes mellitus.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and requirement for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of respiratory failure.
9. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's DIC and thrombocytopenia increase her risk of developing thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
10. Infectious Complications: The patient's ongoing infection, bacteremia, and history of sepsis increase her risk of developing infectious complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance to prevent further complications.
3. Continue to manage the patient's blood pressure with vasopressors and monitor for signs of shock.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and bleeding risk closely.
6. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions and consider erythropoietin therapy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and rash and consider further workup for underlying causes.
8. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider further evaluation for liver dysfunction.
9. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and consider insulin therapy if necessary.
10. Consider further imaging and laboratory testing to rule out underlying causes of the patient's symptoms and to monitor for complications.

Additional considerations:

1. The patient's family is considering a change in her code status, and it is essential to communicate with them and ensure that they understand the implications of this decision.
2. The patient's family is also considering a change in her treatment plan, and it is essential to communicate with them and ensure that they understand the implications of this decision.
3. The patient's medical team should continue to work closely with the family to ensure that they are informed and involved in the patient's care."

   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Shock/Hypotension - Pt continues to be dependent on 3 pressors
   (levophed, neo, and vasopressin).  Likely combination of underlying
   disease (possible APS vs Adult Stills vs HLH) on top of sepsis [**1-1**] coag
   neg staph infection (resistent to oxacillin) and DIC.  Unlikely that
   alone coag neg staph could cause this degree of DIC in a patient.  Pt
   continues to be febrile, but additional source of infection not evident
   given negative blood cultures, UA, CT-scan.
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin, phenyephrine to maintain MAPS >65,
   can start epi if continues to be hypotensive.
   - Continue empiric meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   (vanc trough goal 15-20)

   - Will discuss initiaition of plasma exchange this AM since patient's
   BP is tolerating CVVH
   - TEE recommended per ID, to be done on Monday??
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with anuric renal failure.  Worsening
   Cr, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities --> hypocalcemia
   (corrected 7.9), hyperphos, hyponatermia.  Renal failure likely
   secondary to DIC causing thrombosis formation in addition to
   hyptoension causing ATN.   Placement of femoral dialysis cath and
   initiation of CVVH overnight.  Pt tolerating CVVH
   -cont CVVH with correction of lytes and fluid balance
   - pt with increasing Phos will start Phoslo
   - f/u with renal recs
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo overnight. Per heme-onc, will
   transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.  Fibrinogen 334 after 4U
   of cryo overnight. Hem-Onc performed BM to r/o HLH.

   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   - f/u biopsy results
   - cont heparin gtt and check Factor Xa level (goal 0.3-0.7)
   #Anemia: Pt was transfused 2U pRBC for Hct of 20.9.  Anemia [**1-1**] subq
   bleeding, chronic inflammation, marrow supression, but also should
   consider RP bleed s/p femoral dialysis cath placement.  Will trend and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Shock/Hypotension - Pt continues to be dependent on 3 pressors
   (levophed, neo, and vasopressin).  Likely combination of underlying
   disease (possible APS vs Adult Stills vs HLH) on top of sepsis [**1-1**] coag
   neg staph infection (resistent to oxacillin) and DIC.  Unlikely that
   alone coag neg staph could cause this degree of DIC in a patient.  Pt
   continues to be febrile, but additional source of infection not evident
   given negative blood cultures, UA, CT-scan.
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin, phenyephrine to maintain MAPS >65,
   can start epi if continues to be hypotensive.
   - Continue empiric meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   (vanc trough goal 15-20)
   - empiric fungal coverage with ambisone
   - Surveillance cultures
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s patient completed, solumedrol 1 gram
   Q24H x3 days --> f/u with rheum regarding further treatment.
   - Will discuss initiaition of plasma exchange this AM since patient's
   BP is tolerating CVVH
   - TEE recommended per ID, to be done on Monday??
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with anuric renal failure.  Worsening
   Cr, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities --> hypocalcemia
   (corrected 7.9), hyperphos, hyponatermia.  Renal failure likely
   secondary to DIC causing thrombosis formation in addition to
   hyptoension causing ATN.   Placement of femoral dialysis cath and
   initiation of CVVH overnight.  Pt tolerating CVVH
   -cont CVVH with correction of lytes and fluid balance
   - pt with increasing Phos will start Phoslo
   - f/u with renal recs
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo overnight. Per heme-onc, will
   transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.  Fibrinogen 334 after 4U
   of cryo overnight. Hem-Onc performed BM to r/o HLH.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   - f/u biopsy results
   - cont heparin gtt and check Factor Xa level (goal 0.3-0.7)
   #Anemia: Pt was transfused 2U pRBC for Hct of 20.9.  Anemia [**1-1**] subq
   bleeding, chronic inflammation, marrow supression, but also should
   consider RP bleed s/p femoral dialysis cath placement.  Will trend and
   monitor
   - Q6 CBC labs
   - Transfuse Hct >25
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Purpuric rash consistent with DIC. DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy (catastrophic APLA syndrome vs. Still
   disease vs. hemophagocytic lymphangiohistiocytosis). Currently, blood
   cultures positive from [**8-30**], [**8-31**] with coag negative Staph resistent to
   oxacillin.  All other blood cultures negative Urine culture, Lyme,
   erlichia, rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c
   serologies, malaria smear negative.  Sent for cryptococcus ag,
   hisotplasma ag, coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias, rheumatologic disease
   also a possibility - given high ferritin, currently considering Still's
   disease on differential. ID, rheumatology, hem/onc involved. awaiting
   additional labs . Skin biopsy results nonspecific (thrombosed vessels).
   Sternal bone marrow biopsy by hem/onc for HLH.
   - will discuss initiaition of plasma exchange since pt BP are
   tolerating CVVH
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - empiric  meropenem for GNR coverage and ambisone for empiric fungal
   per ID.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline.
   - Completed solumedrol day [**1-31**].
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs:
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs.
   - follow-up Onc recs
   # [**Name (NI) 1508**] Pt with severely elevated LFT consistent with shocked
   liver.  Elevated on admission associated with her initial presentation
   of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down except for
   tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of cholecystitis
   or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other infectious
   process. Hep serologies neg. Consider EBV --> VL pending. Could also be
   c/w stills disease.
   - see above for management of hypotension
   - Trend lfts
   - F/u hep and other infectious serologies; HCV (-), HBV (-), HBA (-)
   #. Diabetes mellitus: Pt placed on insulin gtt.  Holding po meds. Blood
   glucose elevated, likely secondary to high-dose steroids.
   - Continue insulin gtt, may need to uptitrate as sugars are elevated in
   response to stress

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin, now presenting with sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to cause further organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and coagulopathy.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC is likely to cause further bleeding and thrombosis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's anuric renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may worsen, leading to muscle cramps, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrest and multi-organ failure.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers. This includes:

1. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to identify early signs of deterioration.
2. Administration of antibiotics and antifungals to treat sepsis and DIC.
3. Management of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Management of anuric renal failure with dialysis and fluid management.
5. Management of hypocalcemia with calcium supplementation and monitoring.
6. Management of hyperglycemia with insulin therapy and monitoring.
7. Management of liver dysfunction with supportive care and monitoring.
8. Cardiovascular instability with close monitoring and management by a cardiologist.

In addition, the patient requires further evaluation and management by specialists such as rheumatology, hematology-oncology, and infectious disease to determine the underlying cause of the patient's illness and develop a comprehensive treatment plan."
