   Assessment and Plan
 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold on cardiac cath this AM given resolution of chest pain and
   supratherapeutic INR
   - Increased aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increased atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Wean nitro gtt, write for nitro PRN
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold metoprolol given worsening PR delay
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with 1 major and 3 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic with INR.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Consider repeat TEE given worsening PR delay
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and help confirm the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic secondary most likely to antibiotics.
   - Hold warfarin for now
   - No role for reversal as pt at high risk for thrombotic complication
   with mechanical valve
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Add on viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above
   .
   # FEN: NPO for possible repeat TEE today, replete lytes prn
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold on cardiac cath this AM given resolution of chest pain and
   supratherapeutic INR
   - Increased aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increased atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Wean nitro gtt, write for nitro PRN
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold metoprolol given worsening PR delay
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with 1 major and 3 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic with INR.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Consider repeat TEE given worsening PR delay
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and help confirm the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic secondary most likely to antibiotics.
   - Hold warfarin for now
   - No role for reversal as pt at high risk for thrombotic complication
   with mechanical valve
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Add on viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of rheumatic fever, AVR, and CABG x2, who was transferred to the ICU with gram-positive bacteremia and suspicion of endocarditis. He developed substernal chest pain, which is concerning for ACS. The patient's EKG shows converted NSR with 1st-degree AV delay, and his troponin level is elevated at 0.37. The patient is receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with infective endocarditis. This condition can lead to serious complications, including heart failure, embolic events, and death.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin level are concerning for ACS. This condition can lead to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR is a concern, as it may increase the risk of bleeding complications. The patient is at high risk for thrombotic complications due to his mechanical valve.
4. Nephropathy: The patient's elevated creatinine level is a concern, as it may indicate kidney damage. This condition can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and suspicion of endocarditis increase the risk of infection. This condition can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Embolic events: The patient's splenic infarct and elevated troponin level are concerning for embolic events. This condition can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a concern, as it may increase the risk of stroke and heart failure. The patient's goal INR is 2.5-3.5, but his current INR is supratherapeutic.
8. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia is a concern, as it may indicate underlying disease. This condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his EKG and troponin level.
3. Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of the patient's splenic infarct and worsening PR interval.
4. Consider repeat TEE to evaluate for potential mycotic aneurysm.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Consider adding viral serologies to evaluate for potential viral hepatitis.
7. Schedule an outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate for potential colon cancer.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
9. Consider adding stress ulcer prophylaxis to the patient's regimen.
10. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - NPO after MN for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM,
   especially if still with CP and/or EKG changes
   - Increase aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Continue nitro gtt to titrate until CP free
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Rate control with metoprolol 25mg PO TID to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with technically 4 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - PICC line placement once afebrile
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and clinch the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Consider viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed
   .
   # HLD:
   - atorva 80 per above
   .
   # FEN: cardiac diet (NPO after MN for possible cath), replete lytes prn
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - NPO after MN for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM,
   especially if still with CP and/or EKG changes
   - Increase aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Continue nitro gtt to titrate until CP free
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Rate control with metoprolol 25mg PO TID to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with technically 4 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - PICC line placement once afebrile
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and clinch the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of rheumatic fever, AVR, and CABG x2, who was transferred to the ICU for gram-positive bacteremia and suspected endocarditis. He has developed substernal chest pain, which is concerning for ACS. His EKG shows changes consistent with unstable angina, and his troponin level is elevated. He has a history of unexplained splenic infarction and is at high risk for thromboembolic events.

Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high suspicion for infective endocarditis, which is confirmed by his blood culture data. He has minor criteria for endocarditis, including fever, mechanical valve, and evidence of embolic disease. However, he does not meet the major criterion of blood culture data.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has developed NSTEMI, which is confirmed by his EKG and troponin level. The cause of his myocardial damage is unclear, but it is possible that it is due to a thromboembolic event.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with metoprolol. His Coumadin is being held due to a supratherapeutic INR.
4. Aminitis: The patient has developed aminitis, which is likely secondary to Zosyn. He has been treated with gentamicin and penicillin, and his blood cultures are pending.
5. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has developed normocytic anemia, which is unclear in etiology. He has been treated with iron studies, B12, and folate, and his stools have been guaiac-positive.
6. HLD: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being treated with atorvastatin.
7. FEN: The patient has been placed on a cardiac diet and is being repleted with lytes prn.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his bacteremia and endocarditis.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest due to his NSTEMI and atrial fibrillation.
3. Stroke: The patient is at risk for stroke due to his atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events.
4. Liver Damage: The patient is at risk for liver damage due to his aminitis and possible thromboembolic disease.
5. Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to his bacteremia and possible sepsis.

Treatment Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and EKGs closely.
3. Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of the patient's splenic infarction and worsening PR interval.
4. Continue penicillin and gentamicin for 6 and 2 weeks, respectively.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider obtaining RUQ U/S if necessary.
6. Check iron studies, B12, and folate to evaluate the patient's normocytic anemia.
7. Consider scheduling an outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ENDOCARDITIS, BACTERIAL
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 y/o man with a significant cardiac history of
   rheumatic fever, AVR and CABG x2 (SVG to OM, SVG to RCA, 25 mm CE
   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - NPO after MN for probable cardiac catheterization tomorrow AM,
   especially if still with CP and/or EKG changes
   - Increase aspirin from 81mg to 325mg PO Daily
   - Increase atorvastatin from 40mg to 80mg PO Daily
   - Continue nitro gtt to titrate until CP free
   - Morphine 2-6mg IV Q4H PRN pain
   - Supplemental O2 to reduce myocardial demand
   - Rate control with metoprolol 25mg PO TID to reduce myocardial demand
   - Hold on heparin as pt with supratherapeutic INR and unlikely to help
   in thromboembolic mechanism
   - Hold on plavix for same as above plus surgery has not been ruled out
   - Trend enzymes Q8H until peak confirmed
   .
   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with technically 4 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - PICC line placement once afebrile
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and clinch the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   .
   # Aminitis: Most likely secondary to zosyn as was started on [**2151-5-4**]
   and stopped on transfer on [**2151-5-6**] and has been trending down since.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to statin, however pt had been on statin in [**2147**] and
   had normal LFTs so less likely. Thromboembolic disease to liver is also
   possible, less likely given lack of CT abnormalities. Viral hepatitis
   possible
   - Monitor
   - Consider viral serologies
   - If continues to worsen, obtain RUQ U/S
   .
   # Normocytic anemia: Unclear etiology, baseline in high 20s low 30s.
   - Check iron studies, B12, folate
   - Guiac all stools
   - Schedule outpatient colonoscopy if not already completed

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of rheumatic fever, AVR, and CABG, who was transferred to the ICU with gram-positive bacteremia and suspected endocarditis. He has developed substernal chest pain, concerning for ACS, and has elevated troponin levels. The patient's condition is complicated by a recent unexplained splenic infarction, and he has a high suspicion for endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high suspicion for infective endocarditis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and suspected endocarditis increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's NSTEMI and elevated troponin levels increase his risk of developing a myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Splenic Infarction: The patient's recent unexplained splenic infarction increases his risk of developing further embolic events, which can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's mechanical valve and recent unexplained splenic infarction increase his risk of developing thromboembolic events, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Immune-Mediated Complications: The patient's suspected endocarditis and bacteremia increase his risk of developing immune-mediated complications, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver dysfunction.
7. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's suspected endocarditis and bacteremia increase his risk of developing infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to treat the suspected endocarditis and bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for any further myocardial damage.
3. Monitor the patient's splenic function and watch for any signs of further embolic events.
4. Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery to assess the patient's valve function and potential for further embolic events.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and watch for any signs of liver dysfunction.
6. Consider performing a colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract and rule out any underlying inflammatory bowel disease.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia, and consider transfusing blood products if necessary."

   # Probable endocarditis: Patient with 1 major and 3 minor criteria with
   fever, mechanical valve, evidence of emobolic disease with splenic
   infarct, and blood culture data not meeting specific major criterion)
   however, clinically patient with high suspicion for infective
   endocarditis, and concern for splenic infarction, and increasing PR
   interval (which is most likely secondary to new nodal blockade however
   cannot r/o mycotic aneurysm). It is very unfortunate that he did not
   receive endocarditis prophylaxis during his 2 rigorous dental
   cleanings. Alternative diagnosis are splenic infarct from embolic event
   from a fib, unlikely as does not explain blood cx and pt was
   therapeutic with INR.
   - Consider requesting reevaluation by surgery in light of splenic
   infarction, worsening PR interval, and possible thromboembolic coronary
   occlusion leading to NSTEMI
   - Consider repeat TEE given worsening PR delay
   - Continue penicillin x 6 weeks and gentamicn x 2 weeks (start date
   [**2151-5-6**])
   - Daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Daily EKGs to monitor PR when in sinus
   - ID recs, appreciate their input
   - Check RF to evaluate for immunologic disease which would count as a
   5th minor criteria and help confirm the diagnosis
   - Hold BB given worsening PR delay

   # Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with BB. Coumadin being held in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR. Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for valve and afib.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue BB
   - holding coumadin for supratherapeutic INR, will restart once INR
   <2.5.
   # Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic secondary most likely to antibiotics.

   pericardial valve), and redo AVR/CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5649**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 4721**] 21 mm
   mechanical AVR, SVG to PDA) in [**2147**] now transferred with gram positive
   bacteremia and suspicion for endocarditis now developing substernal
   chest pain concerning for ACS
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with story consistent with unstable angina,
   convincing EKG changes and now new troponin elevation of 0.37,
   confirming the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The question is, is this myocardial
   damage caused by an plaque rupture, or a thromboembolic event? I favor
   the latter given the recent unexplained splenic infarction and high
   suspicion for endocarditis. Demand ischemia less likely as pt without
   tachycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold on cardiac cath this AM given resolution of chest pain and
   supratherapeutic INR

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of rheumatic fever, AVR, and CABG, who was admitted to the ICU with gram-positive bacteremia and suspected endocarditis. He has developed substernal chest pain, which is concerning for ACS. The patient has a mechanical valve and has not received endocarditis prophylaxis during his recent dental cleanings. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with endocarditis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of ACS, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR is a concern, as it may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Aminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may be secondary to antibiotics, statins, or other medications, which could lead to liver damage or failure.
5. Normocytic Anemia: The patient's anemia is unclear in etiology, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
6. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and possible coagulopathy may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could lead to further complications.
7. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient's history of embolic disease and splenic infarction suggests a high risk of thromboembolic complications, which could lead to further cardiovascular events.
8. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and suspected endocarditis may indicate a systemic infection, which could spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
9. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's mechanical valve and possible endocarditis may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as ordered.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic status closely.
3. Consider repeating TEE to evaluate the patient's valve function and potential for endocarditis.
4. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and coagulation profile closely.
5. Consider adding antiviral therapy to the patient's regimen if viral hepatitis is suspected.
6. Schedule outpatient colonoscopy to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal tract.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation and treatment of his endocarditis and potential cardiac tamponade."
