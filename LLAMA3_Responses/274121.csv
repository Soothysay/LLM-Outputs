   [**9-19**] CT Head (Preliminary read):
   Hypoattenuating region in the left frontal lobe, and bifrontal subdural
   fluid
   collections are unchanged from one day prior on non-contrast study.
   [**9-19**] RUQ U/S: Nodular heterogenous liver is non-specific, but may be
   secondary to underlying liver disease. No evidence of cholecysitis.
   Small volume ascites
   [**9-19**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.
   [**9-17**] Stool culture negative for campylobacter, shigella, salmonella.
   [**9-19**] Blood cultures NGTD x2, Sputum gram stain >25 PMNs, 4+ GNR, 2+
   budding yeast. [**Doctor First Name **] (+) 1:160. Aspergillous antigen negative. Toxo PCR
   CSF negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will consider trial of holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves
   (overall coags are within baseline since admission)
   - Continuing to follow head CT
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Will follow up CT abdomen final read, and if LFTs further
   elevated, will check RUQ ultrasound to better evaluate gall bladder and
   CBD.
   -          RUQ as noted above.
   -          Cont to try to obtain outside records
   #) Hypernatremia: Was only getting 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will
   recheck in PM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will consider trial of holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves
   (overall coags are within baseline since admission)
   - Continuing to follow head CT
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Will follow up CT abdomen final read, and if LFTs further
   elevated, will check RUQ ultrasound to better evaluate gall bladder and
   CBD.
   -          RUQ as noted above.
   -          Cont to try to obtain outside records
   #) Hypernatremia: Was only getting 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will
   recheck in PM.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving treatment for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue current ventilator settings and wait for mental status to improve before considering extubation.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has positive blood and CSF cultures, and the neurosurgery team is considering treating the left frontal mass medically without surgical intervention. The patient is receiving antibiotics, and the plan is to follow up with culture data and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which is consistent with Imuran toxicity. The plan is to follow up with iron studies, repeat retic count, and monitor trend. Transfusion may be necessary if HCT <21-22 or symptoms develop.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. The plan is to consider holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated LFTs, which will be monitored and followed up with CT abdomen final read. If LFTs further elevate, RUQ ultrasound will be performed to evaluate gall bladder and CBD.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient was only receiving 30 mL q6H, which was increased to 150 mL. The plan is to recheck in PM.
7. Seizure prophylaxis: The patient is receiving Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, but the dose was held due to elevated corrected level.
8. Neurological monitoring: The patient will have daily head CT, then every other day for 2 days, and then re-assess. EEG will be performed to check for seizure activity.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and anticoagulants. The plan is to continue monitoring and adjusting treatment as necessary to manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) showed nodular heterogeneous liver, no cholecystitis
* Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve, which may indicate vegetations
* Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, but the report is not available
* Fever was present, with a maximum temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C)
* Blood cultures were taken, and the patient received antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, cefipime, acyclovir, gentamicin, and ampicillin

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.5°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 3.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 74 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Keppra (anticonvulsant)
* Dilantin (anticonvulsant)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Infection, particularly sepsis and meningitis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, due to the presence of vegetations on the aortic valve
* Respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator dependence and respiratory distress syndrome
* Renal failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or intracranial hemorrhage, due to the patient's hemolytic anemia
* Neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment, due to the patient's SAH and meningitis.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Small volume ascites
   [**9-19**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.
   [**9-17**] Stool culture negative for campylobacter, shigella, salmonella.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria brain
   abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Given last ABG from [**9-18**], can go down
   on Fi02 (currently at 40%).
   - Will continue current ventilator settings, as she is doing well on 8
   of PS and 5 of PEEP. Ideally would like to wait to see if mental status
   improves before considering extubation.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. Will follow up iron levels as a high level may pre-dispose to
   listeria infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass
   suspected to be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels
   that given positive culture data, should treat this medically without
   surgical intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 3. Will
   need to check gent level 30 minutes prior to 4th dose (tomorrow).
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will follow up final CT abdomen results
no evidence of abscess noted
   on preliminary read however.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Formal TTE request placed to evaluate for endocarditis (will continue
   to monitor PR interval) as source of bacteremia.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess.
   - EEG to check for seizure activity given lack of responsiveness.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input.
   - Follow up pending serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will consider trial of holding SQ Heparin to see if PTT improves
   (overall coags are within baseline since admission)
   - Continuing to follow head CT
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Will follow up CT abdomen final read, and if LFTs further
   elevated, will check RUQ ultrasound to better evaluate gall bladder and
   CBD.
   -          RUQ as noted above.
   -          Cont to try to obtain outside records
   #) Hypernatremia: Was only getting 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will
   recheck in PM.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and is doing well on the current ventilator settings. The plan is to continue to monitor her mental status and consider extubation if she improves.
* Listeria infection: The patient has a confirmed Listeria infection, and the plan is to treat her medically without surgical intervention. She is receiving antibiotics and will have her blood cultures monitored.
* Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is being treated with blood transfusions as needed. The cause is suspected to be Imuran toxicity, but other possibilities include B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy.
* Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. The plan is to continue to monitor her coagulation studies and consider holding SQ Heparin if the PTT does not improve.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and the plan is to continue to monitor her trend and consider further evaluation of her liver function if necessary.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and the plan is to recheck her levels in the afternoon.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory failure if her mental status does not improve or if she develops a secondary infection.
* Listeria infection: The patient may develop further complications from her Listeria infection, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
* Pancytopenia: The patient may develop further complications from her pancytopenia, such as bleeding or infection.
* Elevated INR: The patient may develop further complications from her elevated INR, such as bleeding or stroke.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient may develop further complications from her elevated LFTs, such as liver failure or pancreatitis.
* Hypernatremia: The patient may develop further complications from her hypernatremia, such as seizures or cerebral edema.

The patient's current medications include:

* Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis
* Ativan for seizure treatment
* Ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria infection
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Furosemide for fluid management
* Famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Albuterol for bronchodilation
* Insulin for glucose control
* Tylenol for pain management
* Chlorhexidine for skin care
* Bisacodyl for bowel management

The patient's lab results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 3.7, Hct 26.0, Plt 74
* Liver Function Tests (LFTs): ALT 46, AST 62, Alk Phos 220, T Bili 2.0
* Electrolyte panel: Na 147, K 3.7, Cl 101, CO2 24
* Blood cultures: Positive for Listeria
* Urinalysis: Normal
* Chest X-ray: Normal
* Head CT: Showing hypoattenuating region in the left frontal lobe and bifrontal subdural fluid collections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue current ventilator settings and monitor her mental status
* Treat Listeria infection with antibiotics and monitor blood cultures
* Continue to monitor pancytopenia and transfuse as needed
* Monitor INR and consider holding SQ Heparin if PTT does not improve
* Monitor LFTs and consider further evaluation if necessary
* Monitor sodium levels and consider rechecking in the afternoon
* Continue to follow up with ID and neurology consults as needed."

   [**9-19**] CT Head (Preliminary read):
   Hypoattenuating region in the left frontal lobe, and bifrontal subdural
   fluid
   collections are unchanged from one day prior on non-contrast study.
   [**9-19**] RUQ U/S: Nodular heterogenous liver is non-specific, but may be
   secondary to underlying liver disease. No evidence of cholecysitis.
   Small volume ascites
   [**9-19**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. There is focal thickening of the right
   coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot
   exclude valvular vegetation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There
   is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic
   valve without aortic regurgitation. Cannot exclude aortic valve
   vegetation. If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for
   endocarditis. Preserved regional and global biventricular systolic
   function.
   Culture data: (new results) Serum Toxoplasma IgM and IgG both negative.
   [**9-17**] Stool culture negative for campylobacter, shigella, salmonella.
   [**9-19**] Blood cultures NGTD x2, Sputum gram stain >25 PMNs, 4+ GNR, 2+
   budding yeast. [**Doctor First Name **] (+) 1:160. Aspergillous antigen negative. Toxo PCR
   CSF negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated and has a c-collar in place, which is limiting her ability to extubate.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if she is not extubated or if the c-collar is not removed.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has a confirmed listeria infection, which can lead to sepsis, meningitis, and brain abscess. The patient's immunosuppressed state and iron overload may have predisposed her to this infection.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which may be secondary to Imuran toxicity, B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or malignancy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of pancytopenia.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies or liver disease. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the elevated INR.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be secondary to liver disease or listeria infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the elevated LFTs.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be secondary to insensible losses from fevers, etc. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypernatremia.
7. Subdural collections: The patient has subdural collections, which may be secondary to her CNS process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the subdural collections.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is currently intubated and will continue to receive respiratory support.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for her listeria infection.
3. Pancytopenia treatment: The patient will continue to receive treatment for pancytopenia, including transfusions if necessary.
4. Elevated INR treatment: The patient will continue to receive treatment for her elevated INR, including vitamin K and FFPs.
5. Elevated LFTs treatment: The patient will continue to receive treatment for her elevated LFTs, including liver function tests and imaging studies.
6. Hypernatremia treatment: The patient will continue to receive treatment for her hypernatremia, including free water repletion and electrolyte monitoring.
7. Subdural collections treatment: The patient will continue to receive treatment for her subdural collections, including medical management and potential surgical intervention.

   Assessment and Plan
   60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection,
   with identified sites including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia,
   and possible subdural empyema.  Although the brain lesion has not been
   biopsied, I agree with consultants that the pre-test probability for
   Listeria abscess is so high that risks outweigh benefitis at present.
   Similarly, subdural empyema is possible.
   Listeria monocytogenes infection
   Appreciate help from multiple consulting services.  We will continue
   systemic antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin, and follow gent
   levels.  I believe that the best balance of risks and benefits is
   continued antibiotics with watchful waiting for now; both the abscess
   and the subdural collection may well resolve without surgical
   intervention.  Case discussed with ID.
   Ongoing fevers
   Appreciate ID
s help.  This is most likely to be related to her
   Listeria.  RUQ ultrasound reassuring.  TTE was abnormal but not
   diagnostic for valvular vegetation; will consult TEE service today.
   Coma
   Appreciate neurology
s help.  EEG adequately excludes non-convulsive
   status.  We will ask neurology to help with prognostic information for
   the family.
   Hepatitis
   Will try to get outside records to help sort out the diagnostic data
   supporting autoimmune hepatitis, especially since Listeria sometimes
   presents with hepatitis.
   Respiratory failure
   This is essentially due to neurologic status.  Will evaluate clinically
   as our team gets to know Ms. [**Known lastname 949**].  If appropriate from a
   prognostic and patient-wishes standpoint, would consider comparatively
   early tracheostomy since I suspect that any neurologic recovery will be
   a matter of weeks to months.
   C-collar
   Review prior imaging.  Will ask trauma or spine surgery to evaluate
   prior to removal.
   Anemia
   Follow for now; transfuse for Hct <21

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection,
   with identified sites including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia,
   and possible subdural empyema.  Although the brain lesion has not been
   biopsied, I agree with consultants that the pre-test probability for
   Listeria abscess is so high that risks outweigh benefitis at present.
   Similarly, subdural empyema is possible.
   Listeria monocytogenes infection
   Appreciate help from multiple consulting services.  We will continue
   systemic antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin, and follow gent
   levels.  I believe that the best balance of risks and benefits is
   continued antibiotics with watchful waiting for now; both the abscess

   Coma

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection, including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia, and possible subdural empyema. She is critically ill and requires ongoing antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin, as well as watchful waiting for now. The patient is febrile, with a temperature of 102.5°F, and has a respiratory failure due to her neurologic status. She is also experiencing coma, anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection.
2. Meningitis: The patient's meningitis could lead to increased intracranial pressure, which could result in brain herniation and death.
3. Brain Abscess: The patient's brain abscess could rupture, leading to a life-threatening hemorrhage or abscess.
4. Subdural Empyema: The patient's subdural empyema could lead to increased intracranial pressure, which could result in brain herniation and death.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory arrest.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
8. Cerebral Edema: The patient's cerebral edema could worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock.
10. Sepsis-Induced Cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis could lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by cardiac dysfunction and failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   60-year-old woman with disseminated Listeria monocytogenes infection,
   with identified sites including brain abscess, meningitis, bacteremia,
   and possible subdural empyema.  Although the brain lesion has not been
   biopsied, I agree with consultants that the pre-test probability for
   Listeria abscess is so high that risks outweigh benefitis at present.
   Similarly, subdural empyema is possible.
   Listeria monocytogenes infection
   Appreciate help from multiple consulting services.  We will continue
   systemic antibiotics with ampicillin and gentamicin, and follow gent
   levels.  I believe that the best balance of risks and benefits is
   continued antibiotics with watchful waiting for now; both the abscess
   and the subdural collection may well resolve without surgical
   intervention.  Case discussed with ID.
   Ongoing fevers
   Appreciate ID
s help.  This is most likely to be related to her
   Listeria.  RUQ ultrasound reassuring.  TTE was abnormal but not
   diagnostic for valvular vegetation; will consult TEE service today.
   Coma
   Appreciate neurology
s help.  EEG adequately excludes non-convulsive
   status.  We will ask neurology to help with prognostic information for
   the family.
   Hepatitis
   Will try to get outside records to help sort out the diagnostic data
   supporting autoimmune hepatitis, especially since Listeria sometimes
   presents with hepatitis.
   Respiratory failure
   This is essentially due to neurologic status.  Will evaluate clinically
   as our team gets to know Ms. [**Known lastname 949**].  If appropriate from a
   prognostic and patient-wishes standpoint, would consider comparatively
   early tracheostomy since I suspect that any neurologic recovery will be
   a matter of weeks to months.
   C-collar
   Review prior imaging.  [**Month (only) 11**] need MRI and spine surgery eval prior to
   removal.
   Anemia
   Follow for now; transfuse for Hct <21
   Hyperglycemia

   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will consider trial of extubation versus proceeding straight to
   tracheostomy.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and requirement for mechanical ventilation may indicate respiratory failure. The plan is to consider a trial of extubation versus proceeding to tracheostomy.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient's positive blood and CSF cultures for Listeria, along with the suspicion of a left frontal mass being a listeria abscess, pose a high risk of further complications. The plan is to treat medically without surgical intervention.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia, which is suspected to be secondary to Imuran toxicity, may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of infection.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR, which is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies, may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs, which are suspected to be secondary to Listeria infection, may indicate liver damage or failure.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's persistent hypernatremia, which is likely due to insensible losses from fevers, etc., may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not addressed.
7. Cerebral edema: The patient's elevated intracranial pressure and presence of subdural fluid collections may indicate cerebral edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Septic shock: The patient's positive blood and CSF cultures for Listeria, along with the presence of septicemia, may increase the risk of septic shock.
9. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's presence of DVT prophylaxis may indicate a risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's presence of guaiac-positive brown stool and elevated LFTs may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

The patient's current condition and potential complications require close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 57.3 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, bacterial sepsis, and hemolytic anemia. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has fluctuated between 37.4°C and 38.8°C, with a current temperature of 37.4°C. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, ranging from 120/53 mmHg to 136/63 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been stable, ranging from 86-110 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate has been stable, ranging from 20-31 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation has been 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.7-4.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.4-8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 77-85 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* LDH: 406 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT Head: No significant change in appearance of left frontal lobe hypodensity with mild local mass effect.
* Transesophageal Echocardiogram: Normal left atrium and ventricular systolic function. No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be consistent with abscess in the appropriate clinical setting.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Hemolytic anemia-related bleeding complications
* SAH-related increased intracranial pressure
* Meningitis-related neurological sequelae
* Bacterial sepsis-related multi-organ failure
* Thrombotic complications related to the patient's anticoagulation therapy
* Nutritional deficiencies related to the patient's inability to eat
* Wound infections related to the patient's surgical site
* Respiratory complications related to the patient's respiratory failure

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely to detect any potential complications and adjust the patient's treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure, listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics, including ampicillin and gentamicin. The patient has pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs, which are being monitored and treated accordingly. She also has hypernatremia, which is being managed with fluid repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, but there is a risk of complications if she is failed extubation and is difficult to re-intubate.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient is at risk of worsening mental status, and a head CT will be repeated today to monitor for changes in her imaging.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is being monitored and treated, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this condition.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, and she is at risk of bleeding or coagulopathy.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and she is at risk of liver failure or other liver-related complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is being managed with fluid repletion, but she is at risk of developing hyponatremia or other electrolyte imbalances if her fluid management is not optimized.
7. Subdural empyema: The patient has subdural fluid collections, and there is a risk of developing subdural empyema if these collections are not treated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's listeria infection with antibiotics and monitor for signs of worsening mental status.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her transfusion requirements accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust her liver function tests as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with fluid repletion and monitor for signs of hyponatremia or other electrolyte imbalances.
7. Consider tapping the patient's subdural fluid collections if they do not improve with medical treatment."

   mild local mass effect.
   2. Unchanged bilateral low-density subdural fluid collections.
   3. No evidence for new hemorrhage, increasing edema, mass effect, or
   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)
   culture data.
   Other laboratories:
   AMA negative ([**9-19**]), B-glucan, beta-2-glycoprotein, entamoeba,
   azathioprine/TPMT all pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 200 mL Q4H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Per family, lesion has been present for several
   months. Differential includes foreign object, infection, insect bite.
   No fluctuance or fluid expressed.
   - Will request dermatology consult for further evaluation, appreciate
   assistance.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant amount of sputum, no leukocytosis, and
   overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains unimpressive
   for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate treatment, and will
   have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today to collect further
   culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   3. No evidence for new hemorrhage, increasing edema, mass effect, or
   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 200 mL Q4H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Per family, lesion has been present for several
   months. Differential includes foreign object, infection, insect bite.
   No fluctuance or fluid expressed.
   - Will request dermatology consult for further evaluation, appreciate
   assistance.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant amount of sputum, no leukocytosis, and
   overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains unimpressive
   for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate treatment, and will
   have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today to collect further
   culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, etc. She will need more free water repletion, so
   went up from 30 mL q6H, increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to
   ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP

* CT head: No significant change in appearance of left frontal lobe hypodensity with mild local mass effect.
* Transesophageal echocardiogram: No vegetation on the cardiac valves, small amount of fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess
* Supportive care for respiratory failure
* Monitoring for trend of pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs
* Free water repletion for hypernatremia
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Consultation with neurosurgery for possible decompression or drainage of possible empyema/abscess
* Consultation with hematology for possible bone marrow failure

   CT Head [**9-20**]:
   . No significant change in appearance of left frontal lobe hypodensity
   with
   mild local mass effect.
   2. Unchanged bilateral low-density subdural fluid collections.
   3. No evidence for new hemorrhage, increasing edema, mass effect, or
   acute
   infarction
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)
   culture data.
   Other laboratories:
   AMA negative ([**9-19**]), B-glucan, beta-2-glycoprotein, entamoeba,
   azathioprine/TPMT all pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   c-collar in place limit the ability to extubate her. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Will discuss with trauma surgery or spine surgery removal of her
   c-collar. Concern is that if this remains in place, she cannot be
   easily re-intubated should she fail a trial of extubation. CT c-spine
   was negative for any pathology.
   - Will continue to think forward regarding her respiratory status, as
   it may take considerable time for neurologic recovery to occur. Options
   include possible trial of extubation if c-collar can be removed, or
   proceeding to a tracheostomy. Will consider breathing trial tomorrow.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. At this time, left frontal mass suspected to
   be listeria abscess, (per chart notes) neurosurgery feels that given
   positive culture data, should treat this medically without surgical
   intervention.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 4,
   gentimicin dose checked this morning. Will determine proper once daily
   dosing of gentimicin.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input
will discuss further what the
   predicted recovery may be based on limited patient and case report data
   to help guide family and further management.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE requested to evaluate for abscess and vegetation given that TTE
   could not rule out abscess. Appreciate cardiology assistance. Will
   monitor EKGs for evidence of PR prolongation.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylasis, ativan in event of seizure; will
   hold phenytoin given elevated corrected level (today corrected level is
   26.3)
   - Currently checking daily head CT (yesterday, today), then every other
   day for 2 days, then will re-assess per neurosurgery. Currently will
   continue to treat medically, but need to consider tapping subdural
   collections at some point if no improvement (concern for subdural
   empyema).
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every day or two.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Patient with elevated LFTs, will continue to monitor
   trend. Today all down or stable except for alkaline phos. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team
   this morning, listeria can have similar presentation to viral
   hepatitis.
   -          Called this morning to obtain records: patient was
   hospitalized at [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA initially for first episode of
   elevated liver function tests, then followed up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 979**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**] at
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 981**], OR, where she had her liver biopsy and MRCP.
   #) Hypernatremia: Suspect due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.
   She will need more free water repletion, so went up from 30 mL q6H,
   increased to 150 mL. Will recheck in PM to ensure it is improving.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics for listeria infection. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. There is concern about the c-collar in place, which may limit the ability to extubate her.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient has a suspected listeria abscess in the left frontal lobe, which is being treated medically without surgical intervention.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which is consistent with Imuran toxicity.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which are being monitored.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is suspected to be due to insensible losses from fevers, etc.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Listeria infection: The patient may develop sepsis or septic shock.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient may develop bleeding or infection due to low blood counts.
4. Elevated INR: The patient may develop bleeding or hemorrhage due to clotting disorders.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient may develop liver failure or liver abscess.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient may develop central nervous system symptoms or seizures due to electrolyte imbalance.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old individual who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical issues and interventions.

Key findings and observations:

1. The patient has a fever of 101.2°F (38.4°C), which is a concern given their underlying medical conditions.
2. The patient's B-glucan test result is positive, which may indicate the presence of fungal infections. However, the ID felt that the result is difficult to interpret due to the patient's ongoing antibiotic therapy.
3. The patient's mini-BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) result is pending, but the initial report shows no polys or microorganisms.
4. The patient's chest CT scan shows a 3mm RML nodule, ascites, tiny bilateral pleural effusion, and small pericardial effusion, which are all stable compared to previous scans.
5. The patient's transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows normal left atrial size, no mass or thrombus in the left atrium or left atrial appendage, and normal left ventricular systolic function.
6. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 3.7, which may indicate an underlying infection.
7. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but previous cultures have shown no growth or moderate growth of Gram-negative rods.
8. The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a large amount of stool with no evidence of obstruction.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's positive B-glucan test result and fever, there is a risk of developing sepsis, particularly if the patient's infection is not effectively managed.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other pulmonary complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's TEE result shows some fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum, which could be consistent with abscess in the appropriate clinical setting. This may indicate a risk of cardiac complications, such as endocarditis or valve dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a large amount of stool with no evidence of obstruction, which may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel perforation or abscess.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and there is a risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.

Based on these findings and observations, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and addressing any potential medical complications promptly to ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, and sepsis. They have been experiencing fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 23-32 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 78 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8 and no response to verbal stimuli. They have a positive blood culture for bacteria, which may indicate bacterial meningitis. The patient's hemodynamic status is also unstable, with a blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction.
2. Meningitis-induced cerebral edema: The patient's meningitis may lead to cerebral edema, which can worsen their neurological status and increase the risk of intracranial hypertension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they may require more aggressive respiratory support, including invasive mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase their risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's SAH may lead to hemorrhagic complications, including rebleeding or hydrocephalus.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's bacterial meningitis may lead to infection-related complications, including abscesses or septic shock.
7. Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia may lead to complications, including decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of cardiac failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple organ dysfunction, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   CT head [**9-21**]: No significant change
   CT Chest [**9-21**]: Unchanged 3mm RML nodule; Ascites; tiny bilateral
   pleural effusion; small pericardial effusion (stable)
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have lLsteria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - This AM FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons
   (no literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); sending Coombs test,
   will d/w Heme today
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17, check post-transfusion Hct
   - Repeat hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL today with trach
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have lLsteria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - This AM FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons
   (no literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); sending Coombs test,
   will d/w Heme today
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17, check post-transfusion Hct
   - Repeat hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL today with trach
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated and has a poor mental status, which limits the ability to extubate her.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and poor mental status make her at risk for respiratory failure. The team is considering a trial of extubation, but the patient's mental status remains a concern.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient has a positive blood and CSF culture for Listeria, and her mental status is declining. There is concern for possible worsening of her condition, and the team is monitoring her imaging and lab results closely.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has a history of Imuran toxicity, which may be contributing to her pancytopenia. The team is monitoring her lab results and transfusing as needed.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. The team is monitoring her lab results and will continue to follow her head CT and coagulation studies.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be secondary to liver disease or viral hepatitis. The team is monitoring her lab results and will continue to follow her liver function.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, which may be secondary to insensible losses. The team is monitoring her sodium levels and will continue to replete her with free water as needed.
7. Finger lesion: The patient has a foreign body with granuloma on her finger, which may be related to her autoimmune disease.
8. Gram negative rods in sputum: The patient has Gram negative rods in her sputum, which may be a sign of infection. The team is considering a formal BAL to evaluate for infection.
9. Positive beta-glucan: The patient's beta-glucan test is positive, which may indicate a fungal infection. The team is considering empiric treatment if the patient's beta-glucan test remains positive.
10. Hypotension: The patient has transient hypotension, which may be secondary to volume depletion. The team is monitoring her blood pressure and will continue to replete her with fluid as needed.

Overall, the patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications. The team is closely monitoring her condition and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch, 57.3 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, bacterial sepsis, and severe organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of prolonged seizures and fevers.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm (89-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/59 mmHg (79-151/75 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (23-32 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a positive B-glucan test, which may indicate fungal infection, but the ID felt that it is difficult to interpret in the setting of antibacterial therapy. The patient's dermatological examination revealed hyperpigmentation, which is not related to adrenal insufficiency or acanthosis nigrans, but rather likely caused by sun exposure, liver disease, or photosensitizing agents.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.7-4.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 17.2-21.7%
* Platelet count: 77-85 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 21-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 121-164 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR 16.7/48.1/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 36/<0.01/<0.01, ALT/AST 40/43, Alk Phos/T Bili 224/1.4, Amylase/Lipase 44/279, Differential-Neuts 59.6%, Lymph 36.0%, Mono 1.4%, Eos 2.8%, D-dimer 1729 ng/mL, Fibrinogen 209 mg/dL, Lactic Acid 2.6 mmol/L, Albumin 1.6 g/dL, LDH 345 IU/L, Ca++ 6.8 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.1 mg/dL, PO4 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* ICU care
* Nutrition: enteral nutrition
* Glycemic control: insulin therapy as needed
* Lines: arterial line and multi-lumen central venous line
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine, and VAP prophylaxis with heparin
* Comments: the patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Meningitis-related complications such as increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, or cerebral edema
* Bacterial sepsis-related complications such as septic shock, multi-organ failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Anemia-related complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Hyperglycemia-related complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma
* Hypocalcemia-related complications such as muscle cramps, tingling, or numbness
* Hypomagnesemia-related complications such as muscle cramps, weakness, or cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypophosphatemia-related complications such as muscle weakness, fatigue, or respiratory failure
* Increased intracranial pressure-related complications such as brain herniation or death."

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, and will have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today
   to collect further culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she was failed extubation
   and was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, will consult IP for trach and PEG. Appreciate IP
   assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her, and an iron overloaded state would alsopre-dispose to listeria
   infection per ID's note. Today there is concern for possible worsening
   mental status, as it took more stimuli for withdrawal and she may not
   have been opening her eyes as she was before. Her CT head yesterday was
   without change. Given question of change in mental status, will check
   head CT again today. If there are any changes in her imaging concerning
   for worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 5. Level
   yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, tomorrow initiating keppra 1000 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of two overlapping
   anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased mental status.
   Corrected phenytoin level today is 25.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel from this morning, repeat retic
   count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigement over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, and will have respiratory therapy complete a mini-BAL today
   to collect further culture data.
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure, listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics. Her mental status is poor, and she is at risk for complications if she is extubated and fails to respond to commands. She has pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs, which are being monitored and managed accordingly. She also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water repletion. Her finger lesion is being evaluated, and her skin pigmentation is being investigated. She has gram-negative rods in her sputum, which may represent a true infection, and her hypotension is being managed with volume replacement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening mental status: The patient's mental status is already poor, and further decline could lead to complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated, and her respiratory rate is elevated, which may indicate respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient has listeria bacteremia and meningitis, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia could lead to bleeding or infection if not managed properly.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR could increase her risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs could indicate liver disease or damage, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to dehydration, seizures, or other complications if not managed properly.
8. Finger lesion: The patient's finger lesion could become infected or worsen if not managed properly.
9. Skin pigmentation: The patient's skin pigmentation could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as Addison's disease or hemachromatosis, which requires further evaluation and management.
10. Gram-negative rods in sputum: The patient's gram-negative rods in her sputum could represent a true infection, which requires further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Manage the patient's respiratory status closely, and consider extubation if her mental status improves.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Manage the patient's elevated INR and LFTs closely, and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Evaluate the patient's finger lesion and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Investigate the patient's skin pigmentation and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's gram-negative rods in her sputum and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have lLsteria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been stable.
    If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for worsening edema
   or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel, repeat retic count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have lLsteria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status. Currently, her mental status and
   limits the ability to extubate her. Her elevated respiratory rate is
   likely secondary to her CNS process.
   - Discussed at length risks and benefits of trial of extubation in this
   patient. Her RSBI is encouraging, but her mental status remains very
   poor. Concern would be for complications if she failed extubation and
   was difficult to re-intubate.
   - Based on the fact that it is expected the patient would likely remain
   intubated for the foreseeable future, and based on discussions of team
   with family, trach and PEG. Appreciate IP assistsance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been stable.
    If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for worsening edema
   or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 6. Level
   Gent yesterday was <2, which is goal for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - Follow up iron studies, DIC panel, repeat retic count.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - Appreciate hematology input, will call with questions.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfusing 2 units for Hct 17
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, so increased FW
   flushes to 150 mL Q3H, as wish to avoid D5W in event this may worsen
   cerebral edema (no significant edema at present however).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   #) Finger lesion: Derm evaluated, foreign body with granuloma.
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Consider formal BAL
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension this morning. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Will continue LR boluses
   to keep up urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch, 57.3 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, and PEG insertion. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring reveals a stable blood pressure, but with frequent boluses of 500cc LR. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and presence of rhonchorous bilateral sounds on lung examination increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and positive blood cultures increase the risk of sepsis progression and organ failure.
4. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia may worsen, leading to anemia, jaundice, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Peritonitis: The patient's PEG insertion may increase the risk of peritonitis, especially with the requirement for serial abdominal exams and close monitoring.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's low haptoglobin level may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen the patient's hemolytic anemia and increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of sepsis increase the risk of coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
8. Neurological deterioration: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and bacterial meningitis increase the risk of neurological deterioration, including increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, and potential herniation.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and frequent boluses of 500cc LR increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including cardiac arrest.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and lack of oral intake increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the presence of multiple potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent or mitigate these complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

   CT head [**9-21**]: No significant change
   CT Chest [**9-21**]: Unchanged 3mm RML nodule; Ascites; tiny bilateral
   pleural effusion; small pericardial effusion (stable)
   [**9-20**] KUB: IMPRESSION: Large amount of stool with no evidence of
   obstruction.
   [**9-20**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram:  The left atrium is normal in
   size. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.
   Culture data:
   Sputum [**9-19**] Gram negative rods, moderate growth. Otherwise many blood,
   urine cultures pending or no growth since admission. No other new (+)
   culture data.
   Other laboratories:
   - AMA negative ([**9-19**])
   - B-glucan POSITIVE,
   - beta-2-glycoprotein:
   - entamoeba: pending

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 1 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 1 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

Based on the daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and encephalitis/abscess. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for airway protection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Elevated respiratory rate, likely secondary to CNS process; intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Neurological status: Altered mental status, not responding to commands, and no spontaneous eye opening noted. Recent CT head shows no significant change.
* Hematological status: Pancytopenia, likely secondary to Imuran toxicity or other factors. Hct stable post-transfusion.
* Coagulation status: Elevated INR, suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Monitoring coags every other day.
* Liver function tests: Elevated LFTs, likely due to Listeria infection or other factors. RUQ consistent with liver disease.
* Electrolyte status: Hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses. Will start D5W gently to decrease Na.
* Renal function: Urine output >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
* Infection status: Positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection. ID recs: rechecking, if positive, empirically treat.
* Cardiac status: Normal biventricular function, no significant valvular dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of neurological status, including further decline in mental status or development of new neurological deficits.
* Respiratory failure, including worsening of respiratory rate or development of respiratory acidosis.
* Hematological complications, including further decline in Hct or development of bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
* Coagulation disorders, including further elevation of INR or development of bleeding or thrombosis.
* Liver dysfunction, including further elevation of LFTs or development of liver failure.
* Electrolyte imbalances, including worsening of hypernatremia or development of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
* Renal failure, including worsening of urine output or development of oliguria or anuria.
* Infection, including further spread of Listeria infection or development of secondary infections.
* Cardiac complications, including worsening of cardiac function or development of arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition, including frequent assessments of her neurological, respiratory, and hemodynamic status. She also requires continued antibiotic therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, and antifungal therapy, as well as monitoring of her electrolyte and coagulation status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   sign of peritonitis required; likely will need gastrograffin study in
   48h for ? leak (discuss with IP)
   - Bronchial washing: Gram stain negative, no WBCs, no PMNs, cx pending
   - Keppra switched to IV b/c NPO/NPG x 48h s/p PEG

   appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
   2D, color Doppler or saline contrast at rest. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
   and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
   structurally normal with good leaflet excursion except the right cusp,
   which appears substantially thicker. No masses or vegetations are seen
   on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
   mitral valve. However, there is a small amount thickening and
   echolucency around the fibrous structures connecting the non-coronary
   cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior mitral valve apparatus, and the
   interatrial septum that can be consistent with abcess in the
   appropriate clinical setting. Normal tricuspid leaflets with trivial
   tricuspid regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: No vegetation on the cardiac valves. Small amount of
   fibrous tissue thickening/echolucency in the fibrous structure
   connecting the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve, the anterior
   mitral valve apparatus, and the interatrial septum that could be
   consistent with abcess in the appropriate clinical setting. No other
   intracardiac source of thrombus is identified. Normal biventricular
   function. No signficant valvular dysfunction.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 57.3 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, severe sepsis, and anemia. The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/52 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's blood culture results are pending, but the patient has a history of sepsis and meningitis.

The patient's imaging studies show a 3mm right middle lobe nodule on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, as well as ascites, tiny bilateral pleural effusions, and a small pericardial effusion on a CT scan of the chest.

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, with a focus on managing the patient's sepsis and anemia. The patient will also undergo further diagnostic testing, including a mini-BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) and a CT scan of the head.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest may occur if not properly managed.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and meningitis may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis and meningitis may lead to infection of other organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and spleen, if not properly managed.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications if not properly managed.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ascites and small bowel obstruction may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel perforation and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Renal failure: The patient's sepsis and anemia may lead to renal failure if not properly managed.
10. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis and anemia may lead to multi-organ dysfunction if not properly managed, potentially leading to life-threatening complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 1 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ED recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coag
s every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving antibiotics for Listeria infection. The patient has developed pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs, which are being monitored and managed accordingly. She also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with fluid boluses. The patient's condition is being closely monitored for any signs of worsening sepsis or organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening sepsis: The patient's condition is being closely monitored for any signs of worsening sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia could lead to bleeding or infection, which could be life-threatening.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR could lead to bleeding or hemorrhage, which could be life-threatening.
4. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs could indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which could lead to organ failure.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to seizures, coma, or death if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to hypoxia and death if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition could lead to cardiac arrest or death if not managed properly.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological condition could lead to brain death or death if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely for any signs of worsening sepsis or organ dysfunction.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs accordingly.
3. Continue to treat the patient's hypernatremia with fluid boluses.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and manage accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and manage accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and manage accordingly.
7. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon if there are any changes in the patient's neurological status.
8. Consider consulting with a hematologist if there are any changes in the patient's pancytopenia or elevated INR."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall, 57.3 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), meningitis, bacterial sepsis, severe organ dysfunction, and anemia, hemolytic.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy, percutaneous tracheostomy, and PEG insertion on [**2124-9-22**]. The PEG insertion required two passes, and serial abdominal exams and close monitoring are necessary to detect signs of peritonitis. A gastrograffin study is planned in 48 hours to assess for potential leaks.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature range of 37.9-37.1°C, heart rate of 89-120 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/52-142/73 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet (Plt) counts. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the beta glycan level is being monitored due to potential interference from Ampicillin.

The patient's medication list includes Pantoprazole, Fentanyl, and Keppra, which was switched to IV due to the patient's NPO/NPG status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Peritonitis: Given the PEG insertion requiring two passes, there is a risk of peritonitis, which requires close monitoring and serial abdominal exams.
2. Leaks: The planned gastrograffin study in 48 hours will help assess for potential leaks, which could lead to complications such as peritonitis or abscesses.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's anemia, hemolytic, may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as hypoxia or organ dysfunction.
4. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis may progress to septic shock if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage and meningitis may lead to neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, or increased intracranial pressure.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's decreased platelet count and elevated LDH levels may indicate coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) for the infection. Her mental status is deteriorating, and she is not responding to noxious stimuli. She has developed hypernatremia, pancytopenia, elevated INR, and elevated LFTs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of mental status: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and there is concern for possible worsening edema or bleeding in the brain. If there are any changes in her imaging, she may require re-consultation with neurosurgery.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her Listeria infection, and her hypotension and hypernatremia support a volume-depleted state. Monitoring for worsening sepsis is crucial.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be due to Imuran toxicity, and she requires close monitoring of her blood counts. Transfusion may be necessary if her HCT drops below 21-22 or if she develops symptoms.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies, and she requires continued monitoring for this possibility.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to insensible losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible losses. She requires continued free water repletion, and her sodium levels should be trended regularly.
6. LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and her lipase levels are also elevated. Further monitoring of her LFTs is necessary to rule out any liver disease or damage.
7. Gram-negative rods in sputum: The patient has Gram-negative rods in her sputum, which may represent a true infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to rule out pneumonia.
8. Positive beta-glucan: The patient's positive beta-glucan result may indicate a fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to rule out fungal infection.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications due to her underlying infection and immunosuppressed state. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of mental status: The patient's mental status has been declining, and there is concern for possible worsening due to Listeria encephalitis and abscess.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is intubated for airway protection. There is a risk of respiratory failure if her respiratory status worsens.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which may be due to Imuran toxicity or other causes. This may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be due to nutritional deficiencies or other causes. This may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which may be due to liver disease or other causes. This may indicate liver dysfunction.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, which may be due to insensible losses and may increase the risk of seizures and other complications.
7. Gram-negative rods in sputum: The patient has Gram-negative rods in her sputum, which may indicate a respiratory infection. This may worsen her respiratory status.
8. Beta-glucan positivity: The patient's beta-glucan level is positive, which may indicate a fungal infection. This may worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
9. Hypotension: The patient has transient hypotension, which may be due to volume depletion. This may worsen her sepsis and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticonvulsants as prescribed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical in the ICU. The patient's 24-hour events are significant, including changes to gentamicin dosing due to CNS/endovascular infection, initiation of d5 for hypernatremia, and administration of IV lasix.

The patient's neurologic examination shows some improvement, with more organized brainstem function, PERRL, doll's eyes (although still asymmetric), and some flexion tone of the UE. However, the patient remains non-responsive to noxious stimuli. The patient experienced seizure activity this morning with right-sided facial twitching, which was treated with 1mg of ativan.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC count of 7.7 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are also abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels.

The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT, are pending. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute and an SpO2 of 100%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's CNS/endovascular infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels.
3. Liver dysfunction or failure due to the patient's abnormal LFTs.
4. Respiratory failure or arrest due to the patient's underlying respiratory condition.
5. Seizure activity or status epilepticus due to the patient's recent seizure episode.
6. Infection or bacteremia due to the patient's gram-negative rods on bronchial washings.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  Appreciate IP
   assistance.
   -
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 7. Goal
   gent <2 for once daily dosing.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - TEE as noted
no definite vegetation or abscess seen, but
   abnormalities as noted above.
   - Initiated keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and stopping phenytoin. Combination of
   two overlapping anti-epileptics could be part of reason for decreased
   mental status.
   - Head CT from last two days without change, checking today to ensure
   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who was admitted with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and she is not responsive to noxious stimuli. She has elevated respiratory rate, likely secondary to her CNS process. Her head CT has been stable, but she is at risk of worsening mental status and edema or bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening mental status: The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and she is not responsive to noxious stimuli. This could be due to worsening of her CNS process or the development of new complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, but her respiratory rate is elevated, which could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which could be due to Imuran toxicity, B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or malignancy.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which could be due to nutritional deficiencies or liver disease.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, which could be due to liver disease or viral hepatitis.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, which could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and other complications if not managed properly.
7. Gram-negative rods in sputum: The patient has Gram-negative rods in her sputum, which could represent a true infection or colonization.
8. Positive beta-glucan: The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which could indicate a fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression.
9. Hypotension: The patient has transient hypotension, which could be due to volume depletion, sepsis, or other complications.
10. Peg tube: The patient has a peg tube, which requires close monitoring for evidence of leak or peritonitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Optimize respiratory support to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Manage the patient's hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Monitor the patient's Gram-negative rods in sputum and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Monitor the patient's positive beta-glucan and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Monitor the patient's hypotension and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Monitor the patient's peg tube and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Imaging:
   [**9-24**] CT head, abdomen/pelvis: reads pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post tracheostomy.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status. Her respiratory rate is elevated, likely secondary to her CNS process. She is on pressure support [**7-25**] and will have another spontaneous breathing trial today.

The patient has a history of Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess, and her recent immunosuppressed state may have predisposed her to infection. Serial head CT scans have been stable, but the patient is at risk for worsening edema or bleeding, which would require re-consultation with neurosurgery.

The patient has had seizure activity, which is consistent with the distribution of her presumed abscess in the left frontal area. The seizure may have been contributed to by hypokalemia, and the patient's electrolytes will be checked TID while diuresing.

The patient has pancytopenia, which is consistent with Imuran toxicity, and her HCT is down to 21. She will be monitored for trend, and transfused if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.

The patient has elevated INR, which is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies. She will continue to have head CT scans and coags every other day.

The patient has elevated LFTs, which are stable. She will continue to trend lipase, amylase, and LFTs.

The patient has hypernatremia, which has improved with D5W. She will continue to monitor sodium levels and re-check this evening.

The patient has a question of increased pigmentation, which may be related to her autoimmune disease or other underlying condition.

The patient has Gram-negative rods in her sputum, which may be a contaminant or a true infection. The fever curve is improving, and the patient will be closely monitored for any changes.

The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate a fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. The ID department recommends re-checking the beta-glucan and considering empirical treatment if positive.

The patient has a PEG tube, which required two attempts and is being monitored closely for evidence of leak in the stomach or peritonitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she is at risk for worsening respiratory failure if her CNS process does not improve.
2. Seizure activity: The patient has had seizure activity, and her electrolytes will be closely monitored to prevent future seizures.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, and she will be monitored for trend and transfused if necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has improved with D5W, but she will continue to be monitored for sodium levels.
5. Infection: The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate a fungal infection, and she will be closely monitored for any signs of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a PEG tube, which may be at risk for leak or peritonitis.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a Listeria brain abscess, and she is at risk for worsening neurological symptoms if her infection does not improve."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 2 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**]. Yesterday she was noted not to be breathing when
   spontaneous breathing trial was attempted. Will again complete SBT
   today.
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**] today is day 8.
   Following levels, which thus far have been at goal.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on tomorrow, will need to ensure that
   fungal, AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explaniation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCT
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFP's at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor again
   this PM, but given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need
   additional D5W (no worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is on pressure support. Her respiratory rate is elevated due to her CNS process. She has been diagnosed with pancytopenia, elevated INR, and hypernatremia. She has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy, which may have predisposed her to infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient had a seizure overnight, which was controlled with Ativan. Further seizures may occur due to her underlying CNS process, hypokalemia, and potential Keppra resistance.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to Imuran toxicity, but other causes such as B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, or malignancy should be considered. Further monitoring of her complete blood count is necessary.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR is likely due to nutritional deficiencies, but disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be considered. Further monitoring of her coagulation studies is necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has improved with D5W, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure that her sodium levels remain within a normal range.
5. Listeria brain abscess: The patient's Listeria brain abscess may require surgical drainage or decompression if it worsens or if she develops symptoms such as increased intracranial pressure.
6. PEG-related complications: The patient's PEG placement was difficult, and she requires close monitoring for evidence of leak or peritonitis.
7. Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan result suggests a possible fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her underlying CNS process or sepsis is not adequately treated.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac damage, and further monitoring of her cardiac enzymes is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust her medication as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her medication as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and coagulation studies to ensure that her coagulation status remains normal.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust her fluid management as necessary.
5. Consider surgical drainage or decompression of the Listeria brain abscess if it worsens or if the patient develops symptoms.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's PEG placement and adjust her fluid management as necessary to prevent leak or peritonitis.
7. Consider empiric treatment for fungal infection based on the patient's positive beta-glucan result.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory failure and adjust her ventilation settings as necessary.
9. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac enzymes to rule out cardiac damage."

   no further change given question of change in mental status. If
   unchanged, will check on Saturday, and then again on Monday.
   - EEG was not supportive of convulsive status.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Will work on optimizing reversible factors such as hypernatremia,
   adding lactulose in event that there is a degree of hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on Monday.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   - FDP 10-40, hapto <20, could be hemolyzing for unclear reasons (no
   literature for Keppra as cause of hemolysis); Heme evaluated smear, no
   evidence for hemolysis
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Hct stable post transfusion
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
   Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well as FFP's at
   presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be
   less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CT
s as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Per discussion with team this morning, listeria
   can have similar presentation to viral hepatitis.  Lipase elevated
   today
           -      recheck lipase
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible
   losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible
   losses. She will need more free water repletion, but now NPG x 48 hrs,
   concern for giving D5W given CNS issues.
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: Unclear if this represents true
   infection, but suspect at present this is likely not true pneumonia as
   she does not have a significant/new amount of sputum, no leukocytosis,
   and overall fever curve has improved. Chest x-ray also remains
   unimpressive for infection. Will have low threshold to initiate
   treatment, respiratory therapy completed a mini-BAL yesterday that
   showed no microorganisms or PMNs.
   - Bronchial washings performed by IP: culture pending, no micro seen
   # Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Sent beta glucan pre and post Amp dosing to ascertain whether
   elevated level is related to abx
   #) Hypotension: Patient with transient hypotension overnight. This,
   coupled with her hypernatremia, borderline tachycardia, dry mucous
   membranes, all support volume depleted state. Monitoring closely for
   worsening sepsis. Will continue LR boluses to keep up urine output
   >40-50 cc/hour, SBP >90, and HR<100.
   # Peg: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   respectively. Her recently immunosuppressed state may have pre-disposed
   her. There is concern for possible worsening mental status, as now does
   not appear to withdraw to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been
   stable.  If there are any changes in her imaging concerning for
   worsening edema or bleeding, will re-consult neurosurgery.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving antibiotics, including ampicillin and gentamicin, for the Listeria infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has elevated respiratory rate, likely secondary to the CNS process.
* Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and she is not responding to noxious stimuli. Her CT head has been stable, but there is concern for possible worsening mental status.
* Pancytopenia: The patient has elevated MCV with pancytopenia, which is consistent with Imuran toxicity.
* Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, with RUQ consistent with liver disease.
* Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia, likely due to insensible losses from fevers, increased respiratory rate, and other insensible losses.
* Question of increased pigmentation: The patient has a history of darkening skin pigment over the last months to years, which may be related to her autoimmune disease or other underlying conditions.
* Gram negative rods in sputum: The patient has Gram negative rods in her sputum, which may represent true infection or colonization.
* Positive beta-glucan: The patient's beta-glucan level is positive, which may indicate fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression.
* Hypotension: The patient has transient hypotension, which may be related to volume depletion or sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening mental status: The patient's mental status has deteriorated, and there is concern for possible worsening mental status.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her current condition may be related to ongoing infection.
* Pneumonia: The patient has Gram negative rods in her sputum, which may represent true infection or colonization.
* Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan level may indicate fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression.
* Liver disease: The patient's LFTs are elevated, with RUQ consistent with liver disease.
* Hemolytic anemia: The patient's pancytopenia and elevated MCV may be related to hemolytic anemia.
* Vitamin deficiency: The patient's elevated INR may be related to nutritional deficiencies.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics, including ampicillin and gentamicin, for the Listeria infection.
* IV fluids: The patient is receiving IV fluids, including D5W, to manage her hypernatremia.
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition support, including glycemic control.
* Monitoring: The patient is being closely monitored for signs of worsening sepsis, pneumonia, and other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 58.8 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient has been receiving various medications, including ativan, protonix, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is stable, with a Glasgow coma scale of 8.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's right-sided facial twitching, which broke with 2 mg of ativan, may indicate seizure activity. The patient's history of seizure disorder and the presence of anticonvulsant medications may contribute to this risk.
2. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension after 3 mg of ativan may indicate a risk of hypotension. The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of antihypertensive medications may contribute to this risk.
3. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and the presence of antibiotics may indicate a risk of infection. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's history of respiratory failure and the presence of respiratory medications may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias and the presence of cardiac medications may indicate a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of anticoagulant medications may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of renal failure and the presence of diuretic medications may indicate a risk of renal failure.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient's history of hepatic failure and the presence of antiviral medications may indicate a risk of hepatic failure.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's history of coagulopathy and the presence of anticoagulant medications may indicate a risk of coagulopathy.
10. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis and the presence of antibiotics may indicate a risk of sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient's facial twitching, which broke with 2 mg of ativan, has been treated with a dilantin load of 500 mg, followed by 500 mg in the morning and 100 mg TID. The patient's transient hypotension after 3 mg of ativan responded to a 500cc LR bolus. Gentamicin dosing has been changed to Q12H due to high levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure ranging from 105/47 mmHg to 129/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 is 100%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 27 and AST of 29.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Seizure control: The patient's facial twitching and response to ativan may indicate a seizure disorder, which requires close monitoring and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension after ativan administration may indicate a risk of hypotension, which requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate an infection, which requires further investigation and treatment.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate may indicate hemodynamic instability, which requires close monitoring and management.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and elevated respiratory rate may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's altered coagulation profile and elevated liver enzymes may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires close monitoring and management.
7. Renal failure: The patient's altered electrolyte profile and elevated creatinine level may indicate a risk of renal failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's altered electrolyte profile and elevated troponin level may indicate a risk of cardiovascular instability, which requires close monitoring and management.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize their outcome."

   MICRO:
   - [**9-22**] bronch: >100,000 GNR, yeast
 not treating
   IMAGING:
   - CTH [**9-24**]: No acute changes
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  RSBI 72
   today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**].
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia;
   pt required 2 fluid boluses yesterday for low BP.
   -          SBT again today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on today, will need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc
   - F/U Neuro recs re: anticonvulsants
 Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100
   TID today, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow, QD on Wednesday, then stop Dilantin
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc

 Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100
   TID today, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow, QD on Wednesday, then stop Dilantin
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.

   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.

   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.

   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who was admitted with Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a suspected brain abscess. She has been treated with antibiotics and has shown some improvement in her fever curve. However, she continues to experience seizure activity, pancytopenia, elevated INR, and hypernatremia. She has also developed facial twitching, which was treated with Ativan. The patient's respiratory status remains stable, but she requires ongoing respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity is a concern, and it is important to monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her anticonvulsant therapy as needed.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to Imuran toxicity, and it is important to monitor her hemoglobin and platelet counts closely.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR is likely related to nutritional deficiencies, and it is important to monitor her coagulation studies closely.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is a concern, and it is important to monitor her sodium levels closely to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan result suggests a possible fungal infection, and it is important to monitor her for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains stable, but she requires ongoing respiratory support, and it is important to monitor her for signs of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological compromise: The patient's neurological status is a concern, and it is important to monitor her for signs of neurological compromise, such as decreased mental status or increased intracranial pressure.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust her anticonvulsant therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her Imuran therapy as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's elevated INR and adjust her coagulation therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust her fluid therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her respiratory support as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her therapy as needed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to follow the patient's culture data and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed.
2. Consider repeating the patient's beta-glucan test to confirm the presence of a fungal infection.
3. Consider repeating the patient's head CT to monitor for signs of neurological compromise.
4. Consider repeating the patient's blood cultures to monitor for signs of infection.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's anticonvulsant therapy to better control her seizure activity."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**].
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia;
   pt required 2 fluid boluses yesterday for low BP.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband

   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least

   IMAGING:
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**7-25**].
   -          Will diurese as tolerated by blood pressure, but need to
   watch K and replete aggressively, given seizure at time of hypokalemia;
   pt required 2 fluid boluses yesterday for low BP.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on [**Last Name (LF) 305**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   [**Location (un) 305**]
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Gram negative rods in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient has experienced several complications, including:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and is being managed with pressure support.
* Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient has been treated with antibiotics and has had serial head CT scans, which have been stable.
* Pancytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with pancytopenia, which is thought to be secondary to Imuran toxicity.
* Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which is thought to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which are thought to be secondary to liver disease.
* Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W.
* Question of increased pigmentation: The patient has a history of darkening skin pigment, which is being evaluated by dermatology.
* Gram negative rods in sputum: The patient has gram negative rods in her sputum, which are thought to be a contaminant.
* Positive beta-glucan: The patient has a positive beta-glucan test, which is thought to be an indicator of fungal infection.
* PEG: The patient has a PEG tube, which is being monitored for evidence of leak or peritonitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and the need for intubation.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunosuppressed state and the presence of gram negative rods in her sputum.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her pancytopenia and elevated INR.
* Liver failure: The patient is at risk for liver failure due to her elevated LFTs and liver disease.
* Hypernatremia: The patient is at risk for hypernatremia due to her underlying condition and the need for D5W.
* Increased pigmentation: The patient is at risk for increased pigmentation due to her underlying condition and the presence of gram negative rods in her sputum.
* Fungal infection: The patient is at risk for fungal infection due to her positive beta-glucan test and immunosuppressed state.
* Peritonitis: The patient is at risk for peritonitis due to her PEG tube and the presence of gram negative rods in her sputum.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her management accordingly.
* Continue to treat the patient's Listeria infection with antibiotics and monitor her response.
* Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her management accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's INR and adjust her management accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust her management accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust her management accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's pigmentation and adjust her management accordingly.
* Consider empiric treatment for fungal infection based on the patient's positive beta-glucan test.
* Monitor the patient's PEG tube for evidence of leak or peritonitis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note highlights several significant events and changes in their condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, and their oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 86 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.2 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest x-ray, are pending. The patient's culture data shows the presence of pan-sensitive acinetobacter and yeast in their bronchial washings, blood, and mini-BAL cultures.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antihypertensives. The patient's Keppra and Dilantin doses are being weaned, and they are receiving 1 mg of lorazepam as needed for seizure control.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's culture data shows the presence of pan-sensitive acinetobacter and yeast, which can lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they require mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's anticonvulsant therapy is being weaned, and they are at risk for seizure recurrence.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be adequate, and they are at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and they may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection control: The patient's presence of yeast in their cultures may indicate an infection that requires proper control and management.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's electrolyte levels may require close monitoring and management to prevent metabolic complications such as hyperkalemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with seizure overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, now POD 4 from trach. Her elevated
   respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS process.  RSBI 77
   today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**].
   -          SBT again today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status.
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data.
   - Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (now IV given cannot use PEG), added Dilantin
   given seizure activity, will discuss need for both agents.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role.
   - In event patient has decline or new imaging findings, will again
   address any benefits that decompression or drainage of possible
   empyema/abscess may have. Currently had no evidence of mass effect or
   significant edema on scans.
   - ID recommending repeat LP on today, will need to ensure that fungal,
   AFB, and modified cultures sent (eg to evaluate for Nocardia).
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will try to
   determine how lab samples may be distinguished, given they appear in
   OMR as having been collected at the same time.
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient with right facial twitching overnight felt to be
   seizure activity. This would be consistent in distribution given that
   her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is possible
   that her hypokalemic state contributed to her seizure. Given lower HCT,
   concern was for bleed, however CT not supportive of this or of
   worsening edema/mass effect or other new pathology. Other consideration
   would be that seizures are less well controlled on keppra, given that
   phenytoin has been stopped and is likely now no longer therapeutic.
   Will discuss further with neurology if patient again has seizure
   without other possible explanation. Checking electrolytes TID while
   diuresing, etc
   - F/U Neuro recs re: anticonvulsants
 Keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100
   TID today, [**Hospital1 **] tomorrow, QD on Wednesday, then stop Dilantin
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with pancytopenia
   is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other possibilities being B12
   or folate deficiency, viral process, and less likely malignancy. B12
   and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **]-TID HCTs.
   .
   #) Elevated INR: Stable, suspected to be secondary to nutritional
   deficiencies. Patient has received multiple doses of vitamin K as well
   as FFPs at presentation. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC
   appears to be less likely, but still will continue to monitor for this
   possibility.
   - Continuing to follow head CTs as well as coags every other day.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improved with D5W, will continue to monitor, but
   given she cannot use her PEG yet, will likely need additional D5W (no
   worsening edema after D5W given).
   Given hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, will use LR for further fluid
   boluses.
   - Start D5W gently to decrease Na as pt is now NPO/NPG until at least
   Monday
   - Will continue to trend sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. No PMNs upon
   bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to interpret.
   Additionally, fever curve improving. Will have low threshold to
   initiate treatment should fever curve, secretions, or WBC worsen.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and has been treated with antibiotics. Her condition has been stable, with some fluctuations in her vital signs and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, likely due to her CNS process. Close monitoring and adjustment of her respiratory support is necessary.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient's infection is likely to continue to progress, and close monitoring of her imaging and laboratory values is necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
3. Seizure: The patient's seizure activity may be related to her Listeria infection, and close monitoring of her electrolytes and anticonvulsant levels is necessary.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to her Imuran treatment, and close monitoring of her complete blood counts is necessary.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is stable, but close monitoring of her coagulation studies is necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are stable, but close monitoring of her liver function is necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely related to her inability to use her PEG, and close monitoring of her sodium levels is necessary.
8. Question of increased pigmentation: The patient's family history of darkening skin pigment and her own reports of skin darkening may be related to an underlying condition, and close monitoring of her skin pigmentation is necessary.
9. Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient's Acinetobacter in her sputum may be related to her underlying infection, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
10. Positive beta-glucan: The patient's positive beta-glucan result may indicate a fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. Close monitoring of her fungal cultures and treatment is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Adjust the patient's anticonvulsant medications as necessary to control her seizure activity.
3. Continue to treat the patient's Listeria infection with antibiotics.
4. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her Imuran treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust her treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust her fluid management as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's skin pigmentation and adjust her treatment as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's Acinetobacter in her sputum and adjust her respiratory treatment as necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's beta-glucan result and adjust her treatment as necessary.

ICU Care:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Adjust the patient's anticonvulsant medications as necessary to control her seizure activity.
3. Continue to treat the patient's Listeria infection with antibiotics.
4. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her Imuran treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation treatment as necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with continued activity concerning for seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS
   process.  RSBI 77 today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with continued activity concerning for seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS
   process.  RSBI 77 today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study today, will follow up results

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has been intubated for airway protection and underwent tracheostomy. The patient has been on trach mask ventilation for over 24 hours with reassuring ABG. She has been treated with ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria infection. The patient's mental status remains unchanged, with no response to verbal, tactile, or noxious stimuli. She has been experiencing intermittent seizures, and EEG monitoring is being set up to assess for seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and weaning from trach mask ventilation may be challenging.
2. Listeria infection: The patient's infection is ongoing, and the risk of sepsis and organ failure remains high.
3. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may be a sign of ongoing brain injury or infection, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further seizures.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be related to Imuran toxicity, and close monitoring of blood counts is necessary to prevent bleeding or infection.
5. Elevated coagulation studies: The patient's elevated INR and PTT may be related to nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, or systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs may be related to liver disease or medication toxicity, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent liver failure.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may be related to inadequate free water flushes, and re-checking of sodium levels is necessary.
8. Question of increased pigmentation: The patient's history of darkening skin pigment may be related to Addison's disease, hemachromatosis, or other underlying medical condition.
9. Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient's sputum culture may indicate colonization rather than true infection, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
10. Positive beta-glucan: The patient's positive beta-glucan result may indicate fungal infection, particularly given recent immunosuppression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue trach mask ventilation and monitor respiratory status closely.
2. Continue treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria infection.
3. Monitor seizure activity closely and consider EEG monitoring.
4. Monitor pancytopenia closely and transfuse if necessary.
5. Monitor coagulation studies closely and adjust heparin dosing as necessary.
6. Monitor LFTs closely and adjust medication dosing as necessary.
7. Monitor sodium levels closely and re-check hypernatremia.
8. Investigate increased pigmentation further and consider dermatology consultation.
9. Monitor sputum culture results and adjust respiratory therapy as necessary.
10. Consider fungal treatment if beta-glucan result is confirmed."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch, 57.3 kg individual who was admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on a trach mask.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 3.7 K/uL, Hct of 22.0%, and Plt of 67 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. The patient's liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are elevated, with values of 30 and 35, respectively. The patient's renal function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT and abdomen CT, are negative for any acute changes. The patient's sputum culture is positive for GNR, and the patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent episode of sepsis, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics, including daptomycin and gentamicin, as well as antifungal medication.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient is still requiring invasive ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a trach mask, but the patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 265, which may indicate some degree of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sputum culture is positive for GNR, and the patient's blood cultures are pending. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate a systemic inflammatory response.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient's urine output is decreased. The patient's potassium level is also elevated, which may indicate some degree of renal failure.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate some degree of liver dysfunction.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient's heart rate is slightly elevated. The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, but the patient's electrocardiogram is not provided.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and imaging studies, the patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with continued activity concerning for seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS
   process.  RSBI 77 today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study today, will follow up results
   - IP following

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, with continued activity concerning for seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Her elevated respiratory rate is likely secondary to her CNS
   process.  RSBI 77 today.
   -          Appreciate IP assistance. Currently doing well on pressure
   support [**4-24**], so will transition to breathing trial and re-check ABG
   afterwards, with transition to trach mask if possible.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable.  If there are any changes
   in her imaging concerning for worsening edema or bleeding, will
   re-consult neurosurgery. Given persistent fevers (although curve
   improving), TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite
   abscess or vegetation). Overall fever curve is improving. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 10)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today
   after CT head, to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude
   Nocardia).
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status)
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 [**Hospital1 **] today, then 100
   daily, then stop
   - Repeat head CT today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - This morning, HCT again down, CT ab/pelvis checked given recent
   procedure, no acute bleed upon prelim review.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT increased today, suspect likely
   secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated
   INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver
   disease. Per hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less
   likely, but still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Following [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] need to ensure PTT is lower (eg <40) prior to
   LP today.
   - Holding SQ heparin today.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. T. bili trending downward.
           -      Will continue to [**First Name3 (LF) 1174**] lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Maintanence fluids with D5W, since cannot use PEG
   yet. Will switch to FW flushes once PEG is usable.
   - Will continue to [**Location (un) 1174**] sodium, re-check this evening.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   leak in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study today, will follow up results
   - IP following

   B-glucan [**9-22**] (prior to ampicillin) >500, after ampicillin pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, but remaining obtunded.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP this morning to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia), given PTT is normal this morning after holding
   subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - Will discuss B-glucan results with ID team, await results of LP,
   discuss empiric treatment and further sampling of mass.
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 48 hours (last 24 on
   EEG). Prior to that time, patient has had intermittent movements that
   could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching,
   mouth movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in
   distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Continue free water flushes at current
   rate.
   .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will discuss further with ID.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and has undergone tracheostomy. Her recent medical history includes treatment for autoimmune hepatitis, which may have predisposed her to infection.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for Listeria infection, including ampicillin and gentamicin, and has been started on lactulose for potential hepatic encephalopathy. She is also receiving anticonvulsants, including Keppra, for seizure activity.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia, which is being monitored and treated with transfusions as needed. Her coagulation studies are elevated, but PTT has decreased after holding subcutaneous heparin. Her liver function tests are stable, with some day-to-day variation.

The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection, particularly given her recent immunosuppression. She is also experiencing hypernatremia, which has been resolved with free water flushes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient has had intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures, and may require further treatment and monitoring.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection, and may require further testing and treatment.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is being monitored and treated with transfusions as needed, but may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation studies are elevated, and may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. Liver disease: The patient's liver function tests are stable, but may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has had hypernatremia in the past, and may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Acinetobacter colonization: The patient has Acinetobacter in her sputum, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan may indicate fungal infection, and may require further testing and treatment.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and antibiotic therapy. She is also receiving anticonvulsants and lactulose for potential hepatic encephalopathy. Her nutritional needs are being met through repletion with fiber and insulin for glycemic control. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual weighing 57.3 kg, admitted to the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. They have undergone multiple antibiotic infusions, including daptomycin, gentamicin, and ampicillin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.5°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. Their coagulation studies indicate a prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medication list includes furosemide, lasix, and other ICU medications. They are receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Infection progression: The patient's bacterial meningitis and sepsis may progress, leading to increased risk of mortality and morbidity.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia may worsen, leading to further anemia, jaundice, and increased risk of bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged coagulation times may increase their risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage their respiratory failure, leading to further decline in lung function.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's sepsis and hemolytic anemia may increase their risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's SAH and meningitis may lead to further neurological decline, including increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, or seizures."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with possible continued
   intermittent seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 24 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. Will continue on trach mask with Fi02 of 50%, wean
   FiO2 if possible, follow up ABG in AM, or if patient has other acute
   change.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation). Currently, her
   fevers have resolved, however no change in mental status. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to Q 12. (Today is day 11)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - Will continue to follow culture data, and plan to repeat LP today to
   send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to exclude Nocardia), given
   PTT is normal this morning after holding subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - B-glucan repeated, pre- and post-ampicillin administration (over
   concerns that ampicillin could be causing elevated level). Will look
   for change in level (since both samples timed alike).
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 24 hours. Prior to
   that time, patient has had intermittent movements that could be
   consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth
   movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in distribution
   given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It
   is difficult to say if these activities have been seizures, and they
   have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Requested 24 EEG monitoring to assess if activities correlate with
   EEG evidence of seizures (EEG had not suggestive of non-convulsive
   status), which is being set up today. Routine EEG completed yesterday,
   will follow up results.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], Dilantin 100 once today, then stop
   - Will follow up final head CT and MR to be done today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: PTT down after holding subcutaneous
   heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption of
   subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to
   nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Re-starting free water flushes, will re-check PM
   sodium.
   .
   #) Question of increased pigmentation: Family provided history of
   darkening skin pigment over last months to years. This also was
   reported in her outpatient visits with her gastroenterologist (at that
   time, her T. Bili was 23). Appreciate dermatology input on this matter
   as well. No evidence of adrenal disease (Addison
s, or
   hemachromatosis).
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (NGTD)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will attempt to determine which sample was pre and which was post
   ampicillin administration, but will look for change.
   #) PEG: Required two attempts, being monitored closely for evidence of
   [**Month (only) 1199**] in stomach/peritonitis. CT negative for acute change upon
   preliminary review this morning.
   - Gastrograffin study preliminary results without [**Last Name (LF) 1199**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up
   final results.
   - IP following
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving tracheostomy care.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy via tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated LFTs, with AST and ALT values within normal limits. Her hemoglobin level is 8.2 g/dL, and her platelet count is 94 K/uL. Her WBC count is 3.7, and her Hct is 25.0%.

The patient's neurological examination is limited due to her intubation and sedation. However, she has been experiencing intermittent movements that could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching, mouth movement, and head shaking. These movements have stopped after administration of ativan.

The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, and her recent immunosuppressed state may have predisposed her to infection. She has been treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and her fever has resolved. However, her mental status has not changed, and her EEG has not shown any evidence of convulsive status.

The patient has also been experiencing pancytopenia, with a stable Hct and platelet count. Her elevated MCV may be consistent with Imuran toxicity, and her B12 and folate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's coagulation studies show elevated PTT and INR, which may be secondary to systemic absorption of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated LFTs are stable, with no evidence of ductal dilation or gallbladder abnormalities.

The patient has been experiencing hypernatremia, which has been treated with free water flushes. She has also been experiencing increased pigmentation, which may be related to her autoimmune disease or other underlying condition.

The patient has been colonized with Acinetobacter in her sputum, but her fevers have resolved, and her leukocytosis has decreased. She has also been experiencing positive beta-glucan results, which may indicate a fungal infection.

The patient's PEG tube has been placed, and she is being monitored closely for evidence of peritonitis. Her FEN has been attempted, and she is being diuresed gently due to her extensive peripheral edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued seizure activity: The patient's intermittent movements may be consistent with seizures, and continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that she is not experiencing seizure activity.
2. Infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan results may indicate a fungal infection, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent complications.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's stable Hct and platelet count are a concern, and continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that her pancytopenia does not worsen.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death if not treated promptly.
5. Increased pigmentation: The patient's increased pigmentation may be related to her autoimmune disease or other underlying condition, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.
6. Acinetobacter colonization: The patient's colonization with Acinetobacter may lead to infection, and continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that she does not develop a serious infection.
7. Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan results may indicate a fungal infection, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent complications.
8. Peritonitis: The patient's PEG tube may lead to peritonitis if not properly cared for, and continued monitoring is necessary to ensure that she does not develop this complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch-tall, 58.8 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) on 9/28, which showed no organisms or polymorphonuclear cells. The patient received antibiotics, including gentamicin and ampicillin, and is currently receiving antifungal therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/73 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via tracheal mask, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.6, pCO2 of 22 mmHg, and pO2 of 126 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's skin and neurologic examinations are normal, and their abdominal examination shows mild tenderness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Meningitis: The patient's lumbar puncture results showed no organisms, but the possibility of meningitis cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels.
3. Fungal infection: The patient's receipt of antifungal therapy and the negative cryptococcal antigen test suggest the possibility of a fungal infection, which could lead to disseminated fungal disease.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient's central venous catheter (PICC line) was placed on 9/28, and the patient's blood culture results are pending. The possibility of a catheter-related bloodstream infection cannot be ruled out.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via tracheal mask, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.6, pCO2 of 22 mmHg, and pO2 of 126 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the possibility of respiratory failure cannot be ruled out.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's code status is full code, and the possibility of cardiac arrest cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal examination shows mild tenderness, and the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's use of anticoagulant therapy.
9. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin examination is normal, but the possibility of skin breakdown cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of antibiotics.
10. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic examination is normal, but the possibility of neurologic complications, such as seizures or meningitis, cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, but remaining obtunded.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP this morning to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia), given PTT is normal this morning after holding
   subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - Will discuss B-glucan results with ID team, await results of LP,
   discuss empiric treatment and further sampling of mass.
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 48 hours (last 24 on
   EEG). Prior to that time, patient has had intermittent movements that
   could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching,
   mouth movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in
   distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Continue free water flushes at current
   rate.
   .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, but remaining obtunded.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12)
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP this morning to send for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia), given PTT is normal this morning after holding
   subcutaneous heparin.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role (once can give PO
s again)
   - Will discuss B-glucan results with ID team, await results of LP,
   discuss empiric treatment and further sampling of mass.
   - MR with contrast and MR spectroscopy to be completed to evaluate for
   other etiologies of frontal mass, as per discussion with neurology team
   after interdisciplinary conference, there is concern that her mass is
   not completely consistent with a listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy
   could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   .
   #) Seizure: No abnormal movements noted over last 48 hours (last 24 on
   EEG). Prior to that time, patient has had intermittent movements that
   could be consistent with seizures, such as right facial twitching,
   mouth movement, and head shaking. This would be consistent in
   distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Stable. Per hematology consult, elevated MCV with
   pancytopenia is consistent with Imuran toxicity, with other
   possibilities being B12 or folate deficiency, viral process, and less
   likely malignancy. B12 and folate were WNL.
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20). No new medications or clear offending medications upon review
   of list.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Holding SQ heparin today until after LP, then will re-start at [**Hospital1 **]
   dosing.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently.
           -      Will continue to trend lipase, amylase, LFTs.
   -          Some records obtained, continuing to obtain remainder from
   [**Doctor Last Name 918**] (fax sent again with husband
s consent).
   -          Records from [**Location (un) 841**] pending (faxed request x 2)
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved. Continue free water flushes at current
   rate.
   .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression.
   - ID recs: difficult to interpret in context of abx, recommend
   rechecking, if positive could empirically tx
   -  Will discuss further with ID.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post tracheostomy. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving treatment for Listeria infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/73 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy and oxygen delivery via a tracheal mask.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 3.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 82 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 57 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 35 U/L.

The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a white blood cell count of 14 WBC/uL, with 2 polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and 12 lymphocytes. The CSF Gram stain is negative, and the cryptococcal antigen test is negative.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has a Listeria brain abscess, which is a life-threatening infection that requires prompt treatment.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to jaundice, coagulopathy, and other complications.
5. Seizure activity: The patient has had seizure activity in the past, and there is a risk of seizure recurrence.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may increase the risk of seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
7. Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan test may indicate a fungal infection, which requires prompt treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue treatment for Listeria infection with antibiotics and antifungals.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and liver function tests.
4. Monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Consider empiric treatment for fungal infection based on the patient's positive beta-glucan test.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on a tracheostomy, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 is a crucial step, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient has a history of Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, which can lead to abscess formation. The patient's mental status is a concern, and the possibility of intermittent seizure activity should be monitored closely.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's WBC and HCT are trending downward, which is concerning given their history of immunosuppression. The patient may be at risk for bleeding or infection, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of pancytopenia.
4. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be due to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. The patient is at risk for bleeding, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of elevated INR.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are trending slightly upward, which may be due to liver disease or nutritional deficiencies. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of elevated LFTs.
6. Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient has Acinetobacter in their sputum, which may indicate colonization rather than true infection. However, the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the significance of Acinetobacter in their sputum.
7. Positive beta-glucan: The patient's beta-glucan is positive, which may indicate fungal infection. However, the patient's imaging studies have remained stable, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the significance of positive beta-glucan.
8. FEN: The patient has extensive peripheral edema, which may be due to fluid overload or cardiac failure. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of FEN.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, elevated LFTs, Acinetobacter in sputum, positive beta-glucan, and FEN. Further evaluation and close monitoring are necessary to determine the cause and significance of these complications and to develop an effective treatment plan."

   effusions with compressive atelectasis.
   [**9-29**] MRI:
   PFI: Left frontal lesion demonstrate more increased enhancement with
   intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess. Additional areas
   of
   slow diffusion are seen in the right frontal lobe and left parietal
   region as
   before. New small areas of enhancement are seen in the right frontal
   lobe and
   right caudate head. Bilateral frontal, parietal, subdural fluid
   collections
   are seen with mild indentation of the adjacent brain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient

   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to

   No evidence of tracheoesophageal fistula seen. No pooling of blood in
   the
   trachea or visualized bronchi seen. Moderate right and small left
   pleural
   effusions with compressive atelectasis.
   [**9-29**] MRI:
   PFI: Left frontal lesion demonstrate more increased enhancement with
   intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess. Additional areas
   of
   slow diffusion are seen in the right frontal lobe and left parietal
   region as
   before. New small areas of enhancement are seen in the right frontal
   lobe and
   right caudate head. Bilateral frontal, parietal, subdural fluid
   collections
   are seen with mild indentation of the adjacent brain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and brain abscess. She is currently intubated and on tracheostomy with a re-assuring ABG, but has shown signs of withdrawal to noxious stimuli today.

The patient has a history of seizure activity, which is being monitored with continuous EEG monitoring. She has also shown signs of pancytopenia, with trending downward WBC and HCT, which is concerning given her recent immunosuppressive treatment.

Other notable findings include:

* Elevated coagulation studies, including INR and PTT, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease.
* Elevated LFTs, which are trending slightly upward today, but overall stable.
* Positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection, but the significance is unclear given the patient's recent immunosuppression and stable imaging.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Seizure activity, which may worsen or become more frequent.
* Pancytopenia, which may lead to increased risk of infection or bleeding.
* Coagulation disorders, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
* Liver dysfunction, which may worsen or lead to liver failure.
* Fungal infection, which may spread to other parts of the body or lead to sepsis.
* CNS lymphoma, which may be a consideration given the patient's immunosuppressive treatment and elevated LDH.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuing to monitor seizure activity and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Managing pancytopenia with transfusions and hematological evaluation.
* Monitoring coagulation studies and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Monitoring liver function and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Considering fungal infection and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Considering CNS lymphoma and adjusting treatment as needed.
* Weaning FiO2 and adjusting respiratory support as needed.
* Continuing to monitor and manage the patient's nutritional needs.
* Continuing to monitor and manage the patient's glycemic control.
* Continuing to monitor and manage the patient's prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. The patient has a tracheostomy with blood noted from the site, indicating possible erosion or injury. A CT scan of the neck did not show a tracheoinnominate fistula, but an MRI revealed an abscess in the right frontal and parietal region with slow diffusion, indicating a possible infection.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia, which may be due to azathioprine or hairy cell leukemia. A flow cytometry test is pending to determine the cause of pancytopenia.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, with an SpO2 of 97%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.46, indicating a normal acid-base balance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/73 mmHg. The patient's weight has decreased from 58.8 kg to 57.3 kg.

The patient's laboratory results also show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and LDH, indicating possible kidney and liver dysfunction. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are also abnormal, indicating possible electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CTA neck and MRI, show moderate right and small left pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, as well as bilateral frontal, parietal, and subdural fluid collections.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued ICU care, repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the abscess and possible infection.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory support and possible pneumonia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest due to the patient's electrolyte imbalance and possible cardiac dysfunction.
4. Renal failure and acute kidney injury due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hepatic failure and liver dysfunction due to the patient's elevated LDH and possible liver damage.
6. Nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition due to the patient's decreased appetite and possible gastrointestinal dysfunction.
7. Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to the patient's immobility and possible decreased blood flow.
8. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and possible blood clotting disorders.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   the
   trachea or visualized bronchi seen. Moderate right and small left
   pleural
   effusions with compressive atelectasis.
   [**9-29**] MRI:
   PFI: Left frontal lesion demonstrate more increased enhancement with
   intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess. Additional areas
   of
   slow diffusion are seen in the right frontal lobe and left parietal
   region as
   before. New small areas of enhancement are seen in the right frontal

   right caudate head. Bilateral frontal, parietal, subdural fluid
   collections
   are seen with mild indentation of the adjacent brain.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. Given that patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a brain abscess. She was intubated for airway protection and underwent tracheostomy. She has been on tracheal mask for over 72 hours with reassuring ABG results. She has had significant hemoptysis and blood around her tracheostomy site, which was found to be due to an erosion. She has also had episodes of twitching and right cheek movement, which may be seizures.

Current Status:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and on tracheal mask with a FiO2 of 35%.
* Hemoptysis: The patient has had significant bleeding around her tracheostomy site, which has been stabilized.
* Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient's infection has been improving, with decreasing WBC count and no organisms on CSF culture.
* Seizure: The patient has had episodes of twitching and right cheek movement, which may be seizures.
* Pancytopenia: The patient's cell counts are stable, and she is being monitored for any signs of hematological malignancy.
* Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's INR is stable, and she is being monitored for any signs of DIC.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are stable, and she is being monitored for any signs of liver disease.
* Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient has colonization of Acinetobacter in her sputum, but no signs of infection.
* Positive beta-glucan: The patient's beta-glucan test is positive, but the significance is unclear given the patient's recent immunosuppression.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure if she does not improve.
* Hemoptysis: The patient may experience further bleeding around her tracheostomy site if the erosion is not fully healed.
* Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient may experience further complications from her infection, such as sepsis or abscess formation.
* Seizure: The patient may experience further seizures if the cause is not addressed.
* Pancytopenia: The patient may experience further complications from her pancytopenia, such as bleeding or infection.
* Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient may experience further complications from her elevated INR, such as bleeding or thrombosis.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient may experience further complications from her elevated liver function tests, such as liver failure or encephalopathy.
* Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient may experience further colonization or infection with Acinetobacter if she does not receive proper treatment.
* Positive beta-glucan: The patient may experience further complications from her positive beta-glucan test, such as fungal infection or sepsis.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her FiO2 as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hemoptysis and bleeding around her tracheostomy site.
* Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic treatment as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust her medication as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust her treatment as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's elevated INR and adjust her treatment as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust her treatment as necessary.
* Consider sending the patient for further evaluation, such as a bone marrow biopsy, to rule out hematological malignancy.
* Consider sending the patient for further evaluation, such as a CT scan, to rule out fungal infection.
* Continue to monitor the patient's beta-glucan test results and adjust her treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with some withdrawal to noxious
   stimuli today.
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 48 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 40%.
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 12). Will inquire as
   to anticipated length of treatment (given question of abscess,
   Bacteremia, meningitis), anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), which
   will depend on results of CSF culture.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed yesterday, supports picture of clearing infection
   (decreased WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever
   curve and remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified
   cultures (to exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR with contrast being completed this morning and MR spectroscopy to
   be completed to evaluate for other etiologies of frontal mass, as per
   discussion with neurology team after interdisciplinary conference,
   there is concern that her mass is not completely consistent with a
   listeria abscess. MR spectroscopy could help evaluate for lymphoma.
   Will ask hematology to comment on possibility of lymphoma (see below).
   .
   #) Seizure: This morning, right cheek twitching noted; patient had been
   on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours, but no events had been
   noted. This would be consistent in distribution given that her mass
   (presumed abscess) is in the left frontal area. It is difficult to say
   if these activities have been seizures, and they  have stopped after
   administration of ativan.
   - Will follow up results of 24 hr EEG read, discussed further with
   neurology.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - MR to be completed today, will follow up results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Today, WBC and HCT noted to be trending downward. As
   discussed with ID this morning, this is concerning given that patient
   has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as
   these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities
   included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, will ask
   hematology to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for further
   evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count, differential (to ensure patient is no
   neutropenic)
   - Appreciate hematology assistance.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, PTT down after holding
   subcutaneous heparin, suspect this was secondary to systemic absorption
   of subcutaneous heparin. Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary
   to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per hematology and
   laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but still will
   continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Will likely re-start SQ heparin after hematology evaluation..
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Trending slightly upward today, however overall
   stable, with some day-to-day variation. RUQ consistent with liver
   disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall
   bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending
   downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are
   present in back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many
   attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA,
   where patient was admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic
   failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions, will follow up repeat sputum culture (which has
   acinetibacter)
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive peripheral
   edema as tolerated by BP

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has been treated with antibiotics and has shown some improvement, but remains critically ill.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection, on tracheostomy, and weaning FiO2 to 40%.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, responds to noxious stimuli, and has intermittent twitching of the right cheek, opening/closing of the mouth, and moving of the head, which may be seizure activity.
* Hematological: Pancytopenia, with decreasing WBC and HCT, and elevated LDH.
* Coagulation: Elevated INR, PTT, and D-dimer, but stable, with suspicion of nutritional deficiencies and liver disease.
* Liver function tests: Trending upward, with stable AST and ALT, and elevated bilirubin.
* Renal function: Not mentioned.
* Infectious disease: Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely brain abscess, with positive blood and CSF cultures.
* Other: Acinetobacter colonization in sputum, and positive beta-glucan, which may indicate fungal infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Continued need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: Continued risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Anemia: Pancytopenia and decreasing HCT may lead to anemia and potential bleeding complications.
* Coagulopathy: Elevated INR, PTT, and D-dimer may lead to bleeding complications.
* Liver failure: Trending upward liver function tests may indicate liver failure, which can lead to worsening of the patient's condition.
* Renal failure: Not mentioned, but potential risk given the patient's complex medical history.
* Infectious disease: Continued risk of infection, particularly fungal, given the patient's immunosuppressed state and positive beta-glucan.
* Seizure activity: Intermittent twitching and potential seizure activity may lead to further neurological compromise.
* Pancytopenia: Decreasing WBC and HCT may lead to further immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, neurological, hematological, coagulation, liver, and infectious disease status. Further evaluation and treatment of the patient's pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and liver function tests are necessary. Additionally, consideration should be given to the possibility of lymphoma or other hematological malignancies, given the patient's immunosuppressed state and elevated LDH."

   Nasogastric tube has been removed.
   [**10-1**] CXR: Read [**Month/Year (2) 1327**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 14). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: WBC and HCT improved today, however platelets slightly
   down. Patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs
   and smear have not been consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - A-line discontinued
   - Repeat MRI final read demonstrating new lesions
   - After extensive discussion with ID: Concern for fungal infection that
   has evolved, or endocarditis with septic emboli.
   - Started ambisome for empiric anti-fungal treatment given MRI results.
   - Re-consulted neurosurgery to discuss role of brain biopsy to further
   evaluate
   - Cardiology consulted to plan for repeat TEE to assess for vegetation
   or abscess ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1359**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1360**]), will likely repeat TEE Tuesday morning
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1361**] (ID) spoke with both Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 980**] (neurology attending who
   followed during week), and weekend neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**]. Given need to
   determine prognosis to help guide additional management, neurology will
   see patient this morning and re-assess situation.
   - While investigating foley leak, patient noted to have eyes open, be
   looking around. Engaged in eye contact, shook head ""no"" when asked if
   in pain or having trouble breathing, ""yes"" when asked if cold. Opened
   mouth, stuck out tongue, moved left arm on command. Sister called and
   returned to bedside.
   - KUB for question of possible worsening distension demonstrated likely
   ilieus.
   - 10 mg IV lasix for diuresis
   - Heme reviewed smear: no schistocytes, will re-address BM Bx with
   attending (ID recommended BM Bx as well)
   This morning, patient opens eyes, shakes head
 when asked if short
   of breath, in pain, or if she has abdominal pain. Shakes head
   when asked if she is comfortable. Overnight was at times slightly less
   responsive, but would consistently open eyes when asked.

   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following key points:

1. The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess.
2. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on a tracheostomy mask with a FiO2 of 35%.
3. The patient's mental status has improved overnight, with the ability to follow some commands and attempted to speak.
4. The patient's recent immunosuppressed state secondary to treatment for autoimmune hepatitis may have predisposed her to infection.
5. Serial head CT scans have been stable, but there is concern for intermittent seizure activity.
6. The patient has been on antibiotics for 14 days, and the ID and neurology teams are considering the possibility of a fungal infection or endocarditis.
7. The patient has developed new lesions, and the ID team has initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage and sent off fungal cultures.
8. The patient's WBC and HCT have improved, but her platelets are slightly down.
9. The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be related to liver disease, and the liver team has been consulted.
10. The patient has Acinetobacter in her sputum, but no consolidation, leukocytosis, or significant secretions to suggest true infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fungal infection: The patient's recent immunosuppressed state and new lesions may increase the risk of fungal infection.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's recent bacteremia and meningitis may have seeded her CSF, and the ID team is considering the possibility of endocarditis.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's WBC and HCT have improved, but her platelets are slightly down, and the hematology team has been consulted to evaluate the possibility of a hematologic malignancy.
4. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's INR is elevated, and the hematology team is monitoring for the possibility of DIC.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and the liver team has been consulted to evaluate the possibility of liver disease.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if her FiO2 is not adjusted or if she develops pneumonia.
7. Seizure activity: The patient's intermittent seizure activity may increase the risk of seizure-related complications, such as status epilepticus.
8. Infection: The patient's recent bacteremia and meningitis may have seeded her CSF, and the ID team is monitoring for the possibility of further infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Empiric anti-fungal coverage
2. Fungal cultures
3. Brain biopsy to evaluate the possibility of fungal infection or endocarditis
4. Hematology consultation to evaluate the possibility of a hematologic malignancy
5. Liver team consultation to evaluate the possibility of liver disease
6. Pulmonary consultation to evaluate the possibility of pneumonia
7. Neurology consultation to evaluate the possibility of seizure activity
8. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status
9. Adjusting the patient's FiO2 as needed
10. Continuing antibiotic therapy for 14 days or more, depending on the results of CSF culture and MRI."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), bacterial meningitis, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with new lesions noted on a repeat MRI, leading to concerns for fungal infection or endocarditis with septic emboli. The patient is receiving empiric anti-fungal treatment with ambisome and is being re-evaluated by neurosurgery and cardiology to determine the best course of action.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fungal infection or endocarditis with septic emboli: The patient's MRI results suggest the possibility of a fungal infection or endocarditis with septic emboli, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure, septic shock, and death.
2. Sepsis and organ dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis is causing organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy.
3. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia is causing anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Ileus: The patient's ileus is causing bowel obstruction, which can lead to further complications such as bowel perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is causing hypoxia, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac condition is putting them at risk for cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological condition is putting them at risk for further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and seizures.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent and manage these complications."

   [**10-1**] CXR: Read [**Month/Year (2) 1327**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. Given that patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

   determine prognosis to help guide additional management, neurology will
   see patient this morning and re-assess situation.
   - While investigating foley leak, patient noted to have eyes open, be
   looking around. Engaged in eye contact, shook head ""no"" when asked if
   in pain or having trouble breathing, ""yes"" when asked if cold. Opened
   mouth, stuck out tongue, moved left arm on command. Sister called and
   returned to bedside.
   - KUB for question of possible worsening distension demonstrated likely
   ilieus.

   [**9-30**] KUB:
   Left lateral decubitus view is nondiagnostic for free intraperitoneal
   air due
   to motion artifact, but no gross free air is evident on this limited
   study.
   Mildly distended loops of small and large bowel are identified within
   the
   abdomen, likely ileus. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is present.
   Nasogastric tube has been removed.
   [**10-1**] CXR: Read [**Month/Year (2) 1327**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. Given that patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Appreciate ID assistance with further recommendations.
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

Based on the daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a brain abscess. She has been in the ICU for several weeks and has undergone multiple interventions, including tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on a tracheostomy, with a reassuring ABG and no significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
* Hemoptysis: The patient had significant hemoptysis yesterday, but the bleeding has stopped, and she has been started on anticoagulation therapy.
* Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient's Listeria bacteremia and meningitis have improved, and her head CT scans have been stable. However, there is concern for intermittent seizure activity, and she is being monitored closely.
* Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin have been stable, but there is concern for possible hematologic malignancy.
* Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's INR has been stable, and DIC appears to be less likely.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests have been stable, but there is concern for possible liver disease.
* Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient has colonization of Acinetobacter in her sputum, but it is unclear if it is an infection or colonization.
* Positive beta-glucan: The patient has a positive beta-glucan test, which may indicate a fungal infection, but the results are unclear given the patient's recent immunosuppression.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess could lead to sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Meningitis/encephalitis: The patient's meningitis/encephalitis could lead to further neurological deterioration, including seizures, coma, and death.
* Brain abscess: The patient's brain abscess could rupture, leading to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and death.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's hemoptysis could lead to significant bleeding, which could worsen her respiratory status and lead to respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's colonization of Acinetobacter in her sputum could lead to a true infection, which could worsen her respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
* Fungal infection: The patient's positive beta-glucan test could indicate a fungal infection, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Liver disease: The patient's elevated LFTs could indicate liver disease, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Hematologic malignancy: The patient's pancytopenia could indicate a hematologic malignancy, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotic therapy for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess
* Anticoagulation therapy for hemoptysis
* Continuous EEG monitoring for seizure activity
* Monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies
* Bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for hematologic malignancy
* Fungal therapy for possible fungal infection
* Liver team involvement if laboratory values continue to worsen
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* DVT prophylaxis
* VAP prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over 72 hours now, with
   a re-assuring ABG. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis: Patient yesterday had significant hemoptysis and blood
   around her trach site. Bronchoscopy demonstrated an erosion that was
   felt to likely be the source of her bleeding. CTA was negative for
   fistula. No further bleeding noted. Patient has active type/cross as
   well as additional peripheral IV
s in event of additional significant
   bleeding.
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status: Woke up last night and began to follow simple
   commands
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Neuro checks q2H
   - Lactulose being given in event that hepatic encephalopathy was
   playing role
   - At present, less likely that fungal etiology is responsible for
   frontal head mass (given that all indicators of infection have
   improved, and her head masses have no worsened without treatment for
   fungal infection).
   - MR read as noted above, will follow up final read and discuss further
   with ID and neurology teams.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   .
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - EEG as noted above
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   - Will follow up final MRI results.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. WBC increasing. Given
   that patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Have started antifungal coverage in light of new lesions on MR and +
   beta-glucan
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. WBC increasing. Given
   that patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process).
   Concern had been for hemolysis, however upon re-evaluation by
   hematology, smear was not consistent with this (FDP 10-40, haptoglobin
   was <20).  Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation.
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT

   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She was intubated for airway protection and underwent tracheostomy. The patient has been on various medications, including antibiotics, antifungal agents, and steroids. She has been experiencing hemoptysis, and a bronchoscopy revealed an erosion that was felt to be the source of bleeding. The patient's mental status has been altered, and she has been responding to verbal stimuli. She has also been experiencing seizures, which were initially suspected to be related to the abscess, but later determined to be likely intermittent seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Meningitis: The patient has a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, which can lead to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and brain damage if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Brain Abscess: The patient has a likely diagnosis of Listeria brain abscess, which can lead to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and brain damage if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has been experiencing pancytopenia, which can lead to increased risk of bleeding and infection if not properly managed.
6. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient has been experiencing elevated coagulation studies, which can lead to increased risk of bleeding and thrombosis if not properly managed.
7. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient has been experiencing elevated liver function tests, which can lead to liver failure if not properly managed.
8. Acinetobacter Infection: The patient has been colonized with Acinetobacter, which can lead to pneumonia and sepsis if not properly managed.
9. Fungal Infection: The patient has a positive beta-glucan test, which can indicate a fungal infection, particularly given recent immunosuppression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - PMV today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfuse today if Hct < 21
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Dilated loops bowel: Had large BM yesterday, abd soft but distended,
   non-tender.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   - Follow with daily KUB, serial exams
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR today, possible early PNA. Pt has been
   Afebrile, normal WBC but 6% bands today.
   - If febrile, or clinical deterioration, start abx for HAP
   - Sputum cx
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - PMV today
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.
   - SPEP [**Hospital1 1327**], retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry sent, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   - Transfuse today if Hct < 21
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) Dilated loops bowel: Had large BM yesterday, abd soft but distended,
   non-tender.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   - Follow with daily KUB, serial exams
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR today, possible early PNA. Pt has been
   Afebrile, normal WBC but 6% bands today.
   - If febrile, or clinical deterioration, start abx for HAP
   - Sputum cx
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has been intubated for airway protection and underwent tracheostomy. Her mental status has improved overnight, and she is able to follow some commands. The patient has ongoing issues with pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and requires weaning of FiO2. There is a risk of pneumonia due to the presence of a tracheostomy and the patient's altered mental status.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely brain abscess. There is a risk of further spread of the infection, particularly to the brain, if not properly treated.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has ongoing pancytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Elevated coagulation studies: The patient has elevated INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Elevated liver function tests: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which may indicate liver disease or damage.
6. Dilated loops of bowel: The patient has dilated loops of bowel, which may increase the risk of bowel obstruction or perforation.
7.? RLL infiltrate: The patient has a possible early PNA on CXR, which may require treatment with antibiotics.
8. Fungal infection: The patient has been treated with empiric anti-fungal coverage, and there is a risk of fungal infection, particularly in the setting of elevated beta-glucan.
9. Seizure activity: The patient has had an episode of hemoptysis, and there is a risk of further seizure activity.
10. Marrow biopsy: The patient may require a bone marrow biopsy to further evaluate for possible fungal infection or hematologic malignancy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and wean FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Continue to treat the patient's Listeria infection with antibiotics and monitor for signs of further spread.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's pancytopenia and consider further evaluation with a bone marrow biopsy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation studies and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider consultation with a liver specialist if values continue to worsen.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's bowel status and consider further evaluation with a CT scan if dilated loops of bowel persist.
7. Consider treatment with antibiotics for the possible early PNA on CXR.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and consider further evaluation with an EEG if necessary.
9. Consider consultation with a neurosurgeon to discuss sampling of brain lesions.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual weighing 57.3 kg, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of neurologic symptoms. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for endocarditis and has undergone a tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/69 mmHg.

The patient's neurologic symptoms are improving, with the neurologist concluding that the MRI findings may be an evolution of previous areas with abnormal diffusion rather than new findings. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a peak of 4.1 K/uL, and their hemoglobin level is 7.5 g/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (0.7 mg/dL), troponin-T (<0.01 ng/mL), and D-dimer (1729 ng/mL). Their liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are elevated, with values of 37 and 54 IU/L, respectively. Their kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine clearance of 21.8 mL/min.

The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool T-piece, and their SpO2 is 100%. Their cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their blood pressure is within the normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's diagnosis of endocarditis increases their risk of developing further complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolic events.
2. Neurologic sequelae: The patient's neurologic symptoms may worsen, leading to long-term cognitive or motor impairments.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's impaired kidney function may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, or jaundice.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, leading to respiratory failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and D-dimer levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's DVT prophylaxis may not be effective, leading to the development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted

   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis.
   Given that immunosuppressive agents could mask a hematologic
   malignancy, which is now more evident after they have been held (LDH
   also elevated), and given concern for possible CNS lymphoma, hematology
   was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow biopsy for
   further evaluation, also in setting of question of fungal infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for over several days now,
   with a re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest
   pneumonia. Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had
   episode of hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring;
   bleeding was likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Overnight with marked improvement in mental status
able to follow some
   commands, attempted to speak. Based on MRI yesterday, there is concern
   that patient may have another process such as neoplasm or fungal
   infection, or endocarditis that continues to seed her CSF.
   Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**]
   respectively. Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to
   treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to
   infection. Serial head CT
s have been stable. TTE and TEE completed as
   noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation. EEG was not
   suggestive of convulsive status, however there is concern for
   intermittent seizure activity (twitching of right cheek,
   opening/closing of mouth, moving of head).
   - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 15). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - Appreciate ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Flow cytometry of CSF [**Month/Day (4) 1327**], MR [**First Name (Titles) 1328**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1327**].
   - Given question of fungal infection in setting of new lesions and
   elevated beta-glucan, initiated empiric anti-fungal coverage, sent off
   fungal cultures. Neurosurgery re-consulted to discuss sampling of brain
   lesions. Cardiology also involved as first TEE was not entirely normal,
   to re-evaluate if patient has vegetation or abscess that could account
   for findings (as in this event, would less likely need brain biopsy).
   Neurology to see patient over the weekend and assist with further
   prognosis, work-up, etc. Input greatly appreciated.
   - Aprpeciate hematology assistance with possible marrow biopsy to
   further evaluate for possible fungal infection in setting of (+)
   B-glucan.
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and has been improving in her mental status. She has ongoing issues with pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, and elevated liver function tests. She also has Acinetobacter in her sputum, which is likely colonization rather than true infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizure and has been on seizure prophylaxis medication. There is concern for intermittent seizure activity, which may require further evaluation and management.
2. Listeria infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is being treated with antibiotics, but there is concern for the possibility of abscess or vegetation in the brain or heart, which may require further imaging and evaluation.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has ongoing issues with pancytopenia, which may be related to her autoimmune disease, infection, or underlying hematologic malignancy. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
4. Coagulation disorders: The patient has elevated coagulation studies, which may be related to her liver disease, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying bleeding disorder. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
5. Liver disease: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which may be related to her autoimmune disease, liver disease, or underlying liver injury. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
6. Acinetobacter colonization: The patient has Acinetobacter in her sputum, which is likely colonization rather than true infection. However, further evaluation and management are needed to ensure that this is not a sign of underlying infection.
7. Fungal infection: There is concern for the possibility of fungal infection, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of beta-glucan in her CSF. Further evaluation and management are needed to address this issue.
8. Neurological sequelae: The patient has had significant neurological symptoms, including seizures, altered mental status, and twitching of her right cheek. Further evaluation and management are needed to address these symptoms and prevent further neurological sequelae."

 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 ANEMIA, HEMOLYTIC
 SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH)
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with hemoptysis yesterday.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. Will fit for PM valve today. Doing well on trach mask.
   .
   #) Hemoptysis:  No further bleeding noted.
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status: Increasingly alert.
    - Ampicillin and gentimicin were started on [**9-17**]. Following levels,
   adjusted gent dosing to 120 mg Q 12. (Today is day 13). Length of
   treatment (given question of abscess, Bacteremia, meningitis),
   anticipate several weeks ([**1-24**] or more), will depend on results of CSF
   culture results, final read of MRI, ID and neurology input.
   - LP completed [**9-28**], supports picture of clearing infection (decreased
   WBC, no organisms), especially given improvement in fever curve and
   remainder of hemodynamics. Sent for fungal, AFB, modified cultures (to
   exclude Nocardia). Cryptococcal antigen negative. Monitoring culture
   data which is NGTD.
   - Fungal etiology might be responsible for frontal head mass (given
   that all indicators of infection have improved, and her head masses
   have no worsened without treatment for fungal infection). Started on
   Ambisome
   #) Seizure: Again short episode of right cheek twitching noted this
   morning, which could be monoclonous. Continuous EEG monitoring for over
   24 hours did not reveal any seizure activity. This would be consistent
   in distribution given that her mass (presumed abscess) is in the left
   frontal area. It is difficult to say if these activities have been
   seizures, and they  have stopped after administration of ativan.
   - Increased Keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], changed over to PO.
   #) Pancytopenia: All cell counts stable today. WBC increasing. Given
   that patient has been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two
   weeks, as these were felt to be the most likely etiology (other
   possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process).
    Hematology was re-consulted to comment on utility of bone marrow
   biopsy for further evaluation and ? of CNS lymphoma
   - Sending SPEP, retic count demonstrated marrow is responding
   - Appreciate hematology assistance, flow cytometry send, will continue
   to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   - TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which
   suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
    Pneumoboots for now for DVT prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable. RUQ consistent with liver disease, no
   other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder
   abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have been trending downward,
   AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been obtained and are present in
   back of patient
s chart from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been
   made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was
   admitted with what sounds like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili
   of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   #) Positive beta-glucan.  [**Month (only) 11**] be indicator of fungal infection,
   particularly given recent immunosuppression, however as noted above,
   unclear what to make of positive results given that imaging has
   remained stable and all other indicators of infection have improved.
   Have started antifungal coverage in light of new lesions on MR and +
   beta-glucan
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging. Awaiting repeat TEE to evaluate
   for endocarditis/abscess.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Continue heme/onc work-up as below
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin.
   - Will start Zosyn
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging. Awaiting repeat TEE to evaluate
   for endocarditis/abscess.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Continue heme/onc work-up as below
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin.
   - Will start Zosyn
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She underwent tracheostomy and is currently on tracheostomy mask with marked improvement in mental status. She has been intubated for airway protection and is being weaned off FiO2. The patient has pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, and elevated liver function tests. She has also had episodes of hemoptysis and has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter in her sputum. The patient is at risk for respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's FiO2 is being weaned, but she is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and potential complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has Listeria bacteremia and meningitis, which increases her risk for sepsis. She also has Acinetobacter in her sputum, which may indicate colonization or infection.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase her risk for bleeding or infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and elevated coagulation studies may increase her risk for bleeding or thrombosis.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate liver dysfunction or disease.
6. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney dysfunction or disease.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's Listeria brain abscess and meningitis may increase her risk for neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's elevated blood pressure and heart rate may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiomyopathy.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's elevated liver function tests and elevated bilirubin levels may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as cholestasis or pancreatitis.
10. Infection Control: The patient's colonization with Acinetobacter and potential infection with Listeria may increase her risk for infection control issues such as hospital-acquired infections or cross-contamination.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging. Awaiting repeat TEE to evaluate
   for endocarditis/abscess.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Continue heme/onc work-up as below
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   - PT/OT consults over next 1-2 days.
   - Speech consult for PMV.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor [**Hospital1 1174**], transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Overall stable, some slightly up today. RUQ
   consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal
   dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted. Amylase and lipase have
   been trending downward, AST/ALT WNL currently. Records have been
   obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up in
   [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in
   [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will continue to monitor [**Last Name (LF) 1174**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to involve liver team if
   laboratory values continue to worsen.
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin.
   - Will start Zosyn
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She has undergone tracheostomy and has been on a tracheostomy mask for several days, with reassuring ABGs. Her mental status has improved overnight, and she is being weaned off FiO2. The patient has pancytopenia, with improving WBC count but decreasing Hct. She has elevated coagulation studies, stable LFTs, and a possible Acinetobacter colonization in her sputum. She also has a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR and is being started on Zosyn. The patient is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Weaning off FiO2 may lead to respiratory distress or failure if not done gradually.
2. Pancytopenia: Further decline in Hct may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of infection.
3. Elevated coagulation studies: Continued monitoring is necessary to rule out DIC or other bleeding disorders.
4. Listeria infection: Failure to respond to antibiotics or worsening of symptoms may indicate a need for additional treatment or a change in antibiotic regimen.
5. Acinetobacter colonization: Infection or superinfection may occur if the patient's immune system is compromised.
6. RLL infiltrate: Progression of the infiltrate may indicate a more severe infection or a need for further diagnostic testing.
7. FEN: Over-diuresis may lead to electrolyte imbalances or dehydration, while under-diuresis may exacerbate peripheral edema.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust FiO2 accordingly.
2. Closely monitor the patient's pancytopenia and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation studies and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's Listeria infection and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's Acinetobacter colonization and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's RLL infiltrate and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's FEN and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: Cards following. EKG without conduction
   abnormalities.
   - Plan for repeat TEE today
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: Cards following. EKG without conduction
   abnormalities.
   - Plan for repeat TEE today
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a complex medical history, including autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on trach mask with improving mental status.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is being weaned off FiO2. There is a risk of pneumonia, but bronchoscopy and CTA have ruled out significant secretions.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient is being treated with Ampicillin and gentamicin, and her mental status is improving. There is a risk of fungal infection, but it is less likely given improved CSF and decreased fever curve.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has ongoing pancytopenia, with improved WBC but decreased Hct. There is a risk of malignancy and hematology reconsulted.
4. Aortic Valve Abscess: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. There is a risk of DIC, but it appears less likely.
5. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient has stable elevated INR, which may be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. There is a risk of DIC, but it appears less likely.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient has slightly trending up LFTs, which may be consistent with known liver disease. There is a risk of liver failure, but it is not currently acute.
7. Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient has Acinetobacter in sputum, but there is no consolidation, leukocytosis, or significant secretions to suggest true infection. There is a risk of colonization.
8.? RLL infiltrate: The patient has a possible RLL infiltrate on CXR, but it is not clear if it is infectious or not. There is a risk of pneumonia, but it is not currently clinically significant.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Continuing treatment with Ampicillin and gentamicin for Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess.
3. Monitoring for pancytopenia and considering bone marrow biopsy.
4. Continuing to monitor for aortic valve abscess and considering repeat TEE.
5. Monitoring for elevated coagulation studies and considering heparin prophylaxis.
6. Monitoring for elevated LFTs and considering hepatology consult.
7. Contact precautions for Acinetobacter in sputum.
8. FEN (Furosemide) for diuresis as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications."

   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: TEE negative
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   GNR in Sputum f/u CXR, await speciation
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .

   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures

   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure and was found to have Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She has undergone tracheostomy and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient has shown improvement in mental status and is being weaned off FiO2. She has pancytopenia, which is being monitored, and is at risk for bleeding and infection. The patient also has elevated coagulation studies, liver function tests, and inflammatory markers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has a history of respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 is crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is a significant concern, and monitoring of WBC count, Hct, and platelet count is essential to prevent bleeding and infection.
3. Listeria Infection: The patient has Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. Continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring for complications are necessary.
4. Aortic Valve Abscess: Although the TEE was negative, the patient's history of Listeria infection and aortic valve abscess is a concern.
5. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's elevated INR and D-dimer levels indicate a risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Monitoring of coagulation studies and prophylaxis for DVT are necessary.
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's elevated liver function tests, particularly the alk phosphatase level, indicate liver dysfunction. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary.
7. Acinetobacter Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew Acinetobacter, which may indicate colonization or infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly are necessary.
8. RLL Infiltrate: The patient's CXR showed a RLL infiltrate, which may indicate pneumonia. Futher evaluation and monitoring are necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue weaning off FiO2 and monitor for respiratory failure.
2. Monitor WBC count, Hct, and platelet count closely and transfuse if necessary.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy for Listeria infection and monitor for complications.
4. Consider hepatology consult and RUQ US to evaluate liver function.
5. Monitor coagulation studies and prophylaxis for DVT.
6. Consider bone marrow biopsy to evaluate pancytopenia.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
8. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures."

   Microbiology: [**10-2**] sputum:
    2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask, with marked improvement in
   mental status overnight.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status. Still evaluating for neoplasm,
   but less concerned for fungal infection given improved CSF, decreased
   fever curve and unchanged head imaging.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs
   - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure activity noted
   on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: TEE negative
   .
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. Pneumoboots for now for DVT
   prophylaxis, then likely [**Hospital1 **] heparin.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Slight trending up. Likely consistent with known
   liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high. Records have
   been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart from work up
   in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records from [**Doctor Last Name 918**]
   in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds like near
   fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in thousands).
   - Will order RUQ US today; Consider hepatology consult
   - Will also order GGT to determine if alk phos is from biliary system
      .
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.
   .
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: Seen on CXR yesterday, now with 2+ GNRs despite
   Gentamicin. No clinical signs of PNA (no sputum, no leukocytosis, no
   increase in FiO2)
   - F/U speciation of sputum culture. Will hold on abx for now
   .
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with a seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and a likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated and on tracheostomy, with marked improvement in her mental status overnight.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on tracheostomy, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the FiO2 is weaned too quickly or if there is a sudden change in her respiratory status.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: The patient is still at risk for further complications from Listeria infection, including sepsis, organ failure, and long-term neurological sequelae.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is ongoing, and there is a risk of bleeding or infection if her platelet count remains low.
4. Aortic Valve Abscess: Although the TEE was negative, there is still a risk of aortic valve abscess, which could lead to endocarditis and other complications.
5. Elevated Coagulation Studies: The patient's elevated INR and platelet count may indicate a risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
6. Elevated LFTs: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if not addressed.
7. Acinetobacter in sputum: The patient has Acinetobacter in her sputum, which could lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications if not treated appropriately.
8. RLL infiltrate: The patient has a RLL infiltrate on CXR, which could be indicative of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
9. FEN: The patient has extensive peripheral edema, which could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her closely for any signs of deterioration or complications, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Microbiology: [**10-2**] sputum:
    2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   GNR in Sputum [**10-2**] f/u CXR, await speciation.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs; - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure
   activity noted on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   Transfuse today
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. SC Heparin
   .
   #) Autoimmune Hepatitis: LFTs slight trending up. Likely consistent
   with known liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high.
   Records have been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart
   from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records
   from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds
   like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in
   thousands)
   - RUQ seen, could be c/w fibrosis/cirrhosis. No e/o cholecystitis and
   sludge without dilation.
   - GGT high.
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.
   Inactive Issues:
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: TEE negative
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: seen over weekend, f/u sputum, no significant
   persistence.
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   related to underlying liver disease. No evidence of biliary tract
   abnormalities.5. Patent portal vein.
   Microbiology: [**10-2**] sputum:
    2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 60 year old female with past medical history of autoimmune
   disease, who presented with seizure, found to have Listeria bacteremia,
   meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess, status-post
   tracheostomy, doing well on trach mask.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in
   setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on
   [**2124-9-22**]. She has done well on trach mask for several days now, with
   re-assuring ABGs. No significant secretions to suggest pneumonia.
   Continuing to wean FiO2, currently at 35%. She had had episode of
   hemoptysis, however bronchoscopy and CTA re-assuring; bleeding was
   likely due to small site of erosion.
   GNR in Sputum [**10-2**] f/u CXR, await speciation.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   .
   #) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and
   resultant mental status:
   Continue improvement in mental status.
   - Continue  Ampicillin and gentimicin (started on [**9-17**]).
   - ID recs; F/U cultures
   - Neuro recs; - Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis, no seizure
   activity noted on EEG.
   .
   #) Pancytopenia: Ongoing issue. WBC improved, Hct down. Patient has
   been off of all immunosuppressive agents for over two weeks, as these
   were felt to be the most likely etiology (other possibilities included
   stress of acute infection, viral process). Labs and smear have not been
   consistent with hemolysis. - TPMT returned positive, consistent with
   heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression
   with Imuran treatment. Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc
   reconsulted.
   - F/U cytometry; will continue to consider bone marrow biopsy.
   - Continue to monitor trend, transfuse if HCT <21-22 or symptoms.
   Transfuse today
   #) Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable. Her elevated INR had been felt
   to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease. Per
   hematology and laboratory values, DIC appears to be less likely, but
   still will continue to monitor for this possibility.
   - Appreciate hematology assistance. SC Heparin
   .
   #) Autoimmune Hepatitis: LFTs slight trending up. Likely consistent
   with known liver disease, but alk phos is disproportionately high.
   Records have been obtained and are present in back of patient
s chart
   from work up in [**State 951**]. Many attempts have been made to obtain records
   from [**Doctor Last Name 918**] in [**Location (un) 841**], CA, where patient was admitted with what sounds
   like near fulminant hepatic failure (T. Bili of 23, transaminases in
   thousands)
   - RUQ seen, could be c/w fibrosis/cirrhosis. No e/o cholecystitis and
   sludge without dilation.
   - GGT high.
   #) FEN: Again, will attempt to gently diurese today given extensive
   peripheral edema as tolerated by BP and heart rate.
   Inactive Issues:
   #)?Aortic Valve Abscess: TEE negative
   #) ? RLL infiltrate: seen over weekend, f/u sputum, no significant
   persistence.
   #) Acinetobacter in sputum: No consolidation, leukocytosis, or
   significant secretions to suggest true infection. Fevers have resolved.
   No PMNs upon bronchial [**Last Name (LF) 1119**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] makes culture data difficult to
   interpret, but suspect colonization.
   - Contact precautions.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a past medical history of autoimmune disease, who presented with seizure, Listeria bacteremia, meningitis, and likely Listeria brain abscess. She is currently intubated and on tracheostomy, with a recent episode of hemoptysis, but no significant secretions to suggest pneumonia. Her respiratory status is stable, with a current FiO2 of 35% and ABGs reassuring. She has ongoing issues with pancytopenia, elevated coagulation studies, and autoimmune hepatitis, with LFTs trending up.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Weaning FiO2 as tolerated, but close monitoring for any changes in respiratory status.
2. Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess: Continue improvement in mental status, and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
3. Pancytopenia: Ongoing concern for malignancy and heme-onc reconsulted, with F/U cytometry and consideration of bone marrow biopsy.
4. Elevated Coagulation Studies: Stable, but monitoring for any signs of DIC or bleeding.
5. Autoimmune Hepatitis: Trending up LFTs, with a possible diagnosis of fibrosis/cirrhosis, and high GGT levels.
6. Infection: Monitor for any signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, or significant secretions.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Prophylaxis with SQ UF Heparin, but monitoring for any signs of DVT or PE.
8. Stress ulcer: Prophylaxis with HOB elevation, mouth care, and monitoring for any signs of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust FiO2 as necessary.
2. Continue to improve mental status and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
3. Monitor for any signs of pancytopenia, including bleeding or infection.
4. Monitor for any signs of elevated coagulation studies, including bleeding or DVT.
5. Monitor for any signs of autoimmune hepatitis, including jaundice or abdominal pain.
6. Monitor for any signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, or significant secretions.
7. Monitor for any signs of VTE, including DVT or PE.
8. Monitor for any signs of stress ulcer, including bleeding or abdominal pain."
