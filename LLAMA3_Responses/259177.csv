   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   1. CAD:
   She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once infection
   from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical management
   with aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix 20mg IV with goal of being 1L negative today
   3. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   4. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   5. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity.
   Additional possibility includes pneumonia, endocarditis, or
   osteomyelitis.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - check TTE
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   6. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Will follow/trend.
   - Continue Iron.
   7. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   8. Tachycardia
   Etiology is likely related to her fever and infection.
   - continue to treat her fevers aggressively
   - continue beta blocker
   9. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4
   10. OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: will hold fosamax while in house.
   11. Depression
   - continue escitalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's conditions and plans are:

* CAD: Medical management with aspirin, statin, and Plavix, with consideration for surgical revascularization once infection is cleared.
* CHF/AS: Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV, with goal of being 1L negative today.
* Hypoxia: Continue diuresis, and consider CTA if patient does not improve.
* PVD: Stable, with continued ASA/Plavix and vascular surgery input.
* Fever: Follow-up blood and urine cultures, check TTE, and consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo.
* ANEMIA: Likely multifactorial, with continuation of iron therapy.
* DIABETES: Hold oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for now.
* Tachycardia: Continue to treat fevers aggressively and continue beta blocker.
* HYPTHYROIDISM: Continue LT4.
* OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: Hold fosamax while in-house.
* DEPRESSION: Continue escitalopram.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's infection and fever
* Pulmonary embolism due to her CHF and hypoxia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to her aortic stenosis and CAD
* Respiratory failure due to her CHF and hypoxia
* Worsening of her anemia due to her underlying conditions
* Development of diabetic ketoacidosis due to her diabetes and diuresis
* Osteomyelitis or septic arthritis due to her right lower extremity infection
* Hypothyroidism due to her underlying condition and medication

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   1. CAD:
   She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once infection
   from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical management
   with aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix 20mg IV with goal of being 1L negative today
   3. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   4. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   5. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity.
   Additional possibility includes pneumonia, endocarditis, or
   osteomyelitis.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - check TTE
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   6. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Will follow/trend.
   - Continue Iron.
   7. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   8. Tachycardia
   Etiology is likely related to her fever and infection.
   - continue to treat her fevers aggressively
   - continue beta blocker
   9. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4
   10. OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: will hold fosamax while in house.
   11. Depression
   - continue escitalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
   indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. The diameters of aorta at the
   sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
   (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-28**],
   global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (and
   apprears global) and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed. No
   discrete vegetations identified (does not exclude with deformed
   valves). Is the patient a surgical candidate for AVR?

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition appears to be complex and requires close monitoring. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been experiencing fever, which has trended down, and has undergone a trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The TTE revealed severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, severe aortic valve stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's left atrium is elongated, and the right atrial pressure is indeterminate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history is significant for cardiac disease, including aortic valve stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The patient is currently receiving treatment for fever, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's severe aortic valve stenosis and mild mitral regurgitation may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could progress to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage or failure, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's elevated potassium and magnesium levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may lead to respiratory complications such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.

In conclusion, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further evaluation and treatment should be directed towards addressing the patient's cardiac, infectious, and renal complications, as well as maintaining electrolyte balance and respiratory function."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   1. CAD:
   She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once infection
   from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical management
   with aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.
   - continue lasix 20mg IV with goal of being 1L negative today
   3. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   4. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   5. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity.
   Additional possibility includes pneumonia, endocarditis, or
   osteomyelitis.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - check TTE
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   6. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Will follow/trend.
   - Continue Iron.
   7. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient
   use. Will hold these oral hypoglycemics and institute RISS for
   now while in-house.
   8. Tachycardia
   Etiology is likely related to her fever and infection.
   - continue to treat her fevers aggressively
   - continue beta blocker
   9. HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue LT4
   10. OSTEOPENIA/POROSIS: will hold fosamax while in house.
   11. Depression
   - continue escitalopram

   (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-1-28**],
   global left ventricular systolic function is more depressed (and
   apprears global) and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed. No

   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation
   2. CHF/AS:
   Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to her aortic
   stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears slightly
   hypervolemic.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted with CHF exacerbation, mod-severe aortic stenosis, and 3-vessel coronary artery disease. She has undergone TTE, which revealed severe aortic valve stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient's fever curve has trended down, and blood and urine cultures are negative. She has been diuresed with Lasix and has a goal of being 1L negative today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's severe aortic valve stenosis and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction put her at risk for further cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and negative blood and urine cultures suggest that she may have an underlying infection, which could progress and lead to sepsis or organ failure.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypoxia and tachycardia may be related to a pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening if left untreated.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be multifactorial, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and optimal management.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with an aggressive non-insulin regimen, and further evaluation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with LT4, and further evaluation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy.
7. Osteopenia/porosis: The patient's osteopenia/porosis may be related to her age and medical history, and further evaluation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy.
8. Depression: The patient's depression is being managed with escitalopram, and further evaluation is needed to determine the optimal management strategy.
9. Cardiovascular disease: The patient's 3-vessel coronary artery disease and mod-severe aortic stenosis put her at risk for further cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   # CAD: She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once
   infection from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical
   managementwith aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   -continue beta blocker at increased dose metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - CT surgery aware of patient and will plan on CABG/AVR when infection
   clears
   -will consider vein mapping per CT
   #. CHF/AS: Repeat  echo showed EF 25-30% with progression of  AS to
   severe. Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to
   her aortic stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears
   more euvolemic with ability to wean oxygen to 1L tdoay
   -started 40mg PO lasix regimen, goal to keep patient even to 500cc
   negative
   #.Tachycardia-NSR, baseline HR in 110s likely multifactorial infection
   vs anemia vs PE currently on 37.5 mg TID metoprolol
   -give 1unit of PRBC yesterday
   -monitor on tele
   -uptitrate betablocker as needed for goals HR<110
   -continue fever workup as below
   - LENIs negative on admission, consider CTA to r/o PE if not improved
   #. Hypoxia-Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive
   heart failure. Improved to 1L NC with diuresis. Additional possibility
   includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   #. PVD: Stable, wound vac in place
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input re: wound vac dressing and need for
   antibiotics, to see patient in am
   #. Fever-Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower
   extremity vs osteo. Additional possibility includes pneumonia consider
   CAP vs. HAP. Endocarditis unlikely given neg BCx and echo not
   suspicious for vegetations.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures NGTD
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo
   -appreciate vascular recs re wound vac
   #. ANEMIA: likely multifactorial. Hct at 24, baseline 28, transfused
   1uPRBC yesterday with small bump, decreased this am but HR at baseline
   - Continue Iron.
   -trend hct
   #. DIABETES: Has aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient use.
   -Will continue to hold metformin

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate-severe aortic stenosis and 3-vessel coronary artery disease who was admitted with CHF exacerbation. She has been experiencing tachycardia, hypoxia, anemia, and fever. She has undergone various treatments, including transfusions, diuresis, and antibiotics. Her condition has been stable, but her blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and tachycardia could be indicative of an ongoing infection, which could worsen her condition and lead to sepsis.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF exacerbation could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further fluid accumulation and decreased cardiac function.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia could be related to a PE, which could be a life-threatening complication.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not treated promptly, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to vital organs.
5. Sepsis: The patient's infection could lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly.
6. Endocarditis: Although unlikely, the patient's aortic stenosis and 3-vessel coronary artery disease make her susceptible to endocarditis, which could be a serious complication.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia could be related to pneumonia, which could be a serious complication if not treated promptly.
8. Osteomyelitis: The patient's right lower extremity wound could be infected, leading to osteomyelitis, which could be a serious complication.
9. Kidney Injury: The patient's fluid overload and decreased cardiac function could lead to kidney injury, which could worsen her condition.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia could worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with impaired skin integrity, fever, and hypotension. The patient has undergone various interventions, including transfusion of 1 unit of red blood cells and administration of furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/61 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and their oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased blood urea nitrogen.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially leading to organ damage or failure.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating excessive fluid loss, which could lead to hypovolemic shock or other complications.
4. Respiratory compromise: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but their respiratory rate is elevated, which may indicate underlying respiratory dysfunction or potential for respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and fever increase the risk of infection, which could spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis or organ failure.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate inadequate cardiac output or potential for cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which could lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, or other complications.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is elevated, which may indicate impaired renal function or potential for acute kidney injury.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify potential complications early and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or manage them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of fever, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. They have received 1 unit of RBCs and 60mg IV furosemide. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/61 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and their abdominal examination is soft and non-tender.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not recognized and treated promptly.
2. Infection: The patient's peripheral stick and blood cultures may indicate the presence of an infection, which could be causing their fever and hypotension.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating a loss of fluid, which could lead to hypovolemic shock if not addressed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, which may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest and other complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is limited, and they are not assessed for movement, tone, or responsiveness, which may indicate the presence of neurological complications.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury and other complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and provide appropriate treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o female with mod-severe aortic stenosis and 3 vessel coronary
   artery disease was admitted with CHF exacerbation.
   # CAD: She will be candidate for surgical revascularization once
   infection from foot is cleared. For now, will continue medical
   managementwith aspirin. Plavix is primarily for PVD/stenting.
   - continue aspirin, statin, plavix
   - will follow-up with CT surgery regarding need for any further
   pre-operative evaluation (will need AVR at that time)
   #. CHF/AS: Repeat  echo showed EF 25-30% with progression of  AS to
   severe. Etiology of her decompensation is unclear, but likely due to
   her aortic stenosis and worsened with infection. She currently appears
   slightly hypervolemic.

   -continue fever workup as below
   - LENIs negative on admission, consider CTA to r/o PE if not improved
   #. Hypoxia
   Etiology of her hypoxia is likely related to congestive heart failure.
   Additional possibility includes pulmonary emboli.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - if she doesn't improve with diuresis, consider CTA
   #. PVD: Stable
   - continue asa/plavix.
   - appreciate vascular surgery input
   #. Fever
   Differential diagnosis includes infection in her right lower extremity
   vs osteo. Additional possibility includes pneumonia consider CAP vs.
   HAP. Endocarditis unlikely given neg BCx and echo not suspicious for
   vegetations.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures NGTD
   - consider right lower extremity imaging for evidence of osteo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current health status:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with moderate-severe aortic stenosis and 3-vessel coronary artery disease, admitted with a CHF exacerbation. She has undergone repeat echo, which showed an EF of 25-30% with progression of AS to severe. Her etiology of decompensation is unclear, but likely related to her aortic stenosis and worsened by infection.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* CHF/AS: Severe aortic stenosis with EF 25-30%
* CAD: 3-vessel coronary artery disease
* Anemia: Hct at 24, baseline 28
* Diabetes: Aggressive non-insulin regimen for outpatient use
* Hypothyroidism: Continues LT4
* Osteopenia/Porosis: Will hold fosamax while in house
* Depression: Continues escitalopram
* FEN: Cardiac diet, 2g salt

The patient has undergone various treatments and interventions, including:

* Infusions of furosemide, lasix, and blood products
* Administration of antibiotics, including IV lasix
* Continuous diuresis with goal 500-1L negative
* Monitoring of tele and uptitration of beta blocker as needed
* Fever workup, including CTA to r/o PE if not improved

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening of CHF/AS
* Development of pulmonary emboli
* Osteomyelitis or sepsis related to right lower extremity infection
* Endocarditis
* Anemia
* Hypoxia
* Pneumonia or HAP
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypothyroidism
* Osteopenia/Porosis

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.1-8.6 K/uL
* Hct: 26.4-24.2%
* Plt: 347 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8-0.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.10 ng/mL
* Glucose: 140-101 mg/dL
* Ca++: 8.8-8.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7-1.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.1-2.8 mg/dL
* Eos: 0.3-0.2%
* Lymph: 7.7-7.5%
* Mono: 4.7-4.3%
* Differential-Neuts: 87.3-85.7%

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tcurrent: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* HR: 105 bpm (97-135 bpm)
* BP: 109/61 mmHg (73-113/81 mmHg)
* RR: 25 inspirations per minute (19-30 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, overweight/obese
* Eyes/conjunctiva: Conjunctiva pale
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal, systolic murmur heard best at the RUSB
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse doppler, left DP pulse doppler
* Respiratory/chest: Breath sounds crackles bibasilar
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right: Trace, left: Trace, right ankle wrapped with no drainage or leakage
* Skin: R
* Neurologic: Responds to, movement, tone not assessed

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications."
