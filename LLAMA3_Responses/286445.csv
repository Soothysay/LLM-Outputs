   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q4h, transfuse for Hct > 25
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2. Overnight pt still
   bleeding despite INR < 2, pt to angio but no active extravasation seen.
   IR will follow.
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs - ?angio for embolization (unsigned note)
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Transfuse Plts if < 50
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # ARRHYTHMIA/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in setting of CHB.
   Pt with WCT, paced, to 100s-120s overnight [**5-15**]. In and out of sinus
   rhythm with HR 70s-80s. Unclear why pacer is pacing a tachycardic
   rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - Consider EP consult if tachycardia increases.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve, admitted for subtherapeutic INR and coumadin, who developed a retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) with an 8-point Hct drop. The patient's current condition is critical, with persistent hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening back pain.

The patient has received multiple blood products, including 5 units of pRBCs and 6 units of FFP, and has undergone angiography with no acute extravasation or intervention. The patient's lab results show a significant drop in Hct from 39.2 to 25.5, and his creatinine is elevated at 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including coagulopathy/mechanical valve, acute renal failure, arrhythmia/atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, CAD s/p CABG, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, COPD, and history of GIB.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's RP bleed is ongoing, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia indicate hypovolemic shock, which can lead to organ failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and his urine output is low, indicating a risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's mechanical aortic valve and history of CABG put him at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and history of GIB put him at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and history of GIB put him at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his bleeding, blood pressure, and cardiac status. He should receive further blood products and fluid resuscitation as needed, and his cardiac enzymes should be monitored closely. The patient's electrolytes should be repleted, and he should be closely monitored for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for subtherapeutic INR and presented with 2 days of low back pain. The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, which is spontaneous and unclear in etiology. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions, including 5 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Coagulopathy/Mechnical Valve: The patient's INR is slightly supratherapeutic, and he is on a lovenox bridge. The patient has received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma to decrease the INR.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is 1.7, and he has received contrast for CT and angiography procedures. The patient's urine output is low, and he has a Foley catheter in place.
3. Arrhythmia/Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a paced rhythm with a heart rate of 100s-120s overnight. The patient's pacer is pacing a tachycardic rhythm, and an EP consult is being considered.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly related to bleeding and multiple transfusions.
5. CAD s/p CABG: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is taking simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is taking multiple medications to manage his blood pressure.
8. COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is taking medication to manage his symptoms.
9. History of GIB: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is taking medication to prevent further episodes.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C
* Heart rate: 77 bpm
* Blood pressure: 92/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.6%
* Platelet count: 193 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Sodium: 141 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Glucose: 156 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Maintaining active type and screen, 2 large bore PIVs, and 2 units crossed in the blood bank
* Transfusing for a hematocrit of less than 25%
* Holding home ASA, coumadin, and lovenox
* Monitoring urine output and intravenous fluids
* Trending lactate levels
* Following urine culture and urinalysis
* Considering an EP consult for arrhythmia management
* Restarting heparin with a goal PTT of 60-80 once the INR is less than 2.0 and the hematocrit is stable for 24 hours without transfusions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q4h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs - ?angio for embolization (unsigned note)
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2. Overnight pt still
   bleeding despite INR < 2, pt to angio but no active extravasation seen.
   IR will follow.
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue simvastatin

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, which is a life-threatening condition. The bleeding is ongoing, and the patient has received multiple units of blood products and IV fluids. The bleeding may continue to worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, which can lead to bleeding and coagulopathy. The INR is being closely monitored, and the patient is receiving blood products and IV fluids to correct the coagulopathy.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.7, and the urine output is low. The patient has received contrast for CT and angiography, which can cause nephrotoxicity. The patient's kidney function is being closely monitored, and the patient is receiving IV fluids and blood products to support kidney function.
4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has developed a paced WCT. The patient is receiving amiodarone to control the tachyarrhythmia.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 10.9, which is elevated. The patient may be at risk for infection, and the white blood cell count is being closely monitored.
6. Hypotension: The patient has a blood pressure of 92/49 mmHg, which is low. The patient is receiving IV fluids and blood products to support blood pressure.
7. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient has a distended abdomen, and the bladder pressure is elevated. The patient may be at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to organ failure and death.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and coagulopathy closely.
2. Continue to support the patient's kidney function with IV fluids and blood products.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's tachyarrhythmia and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust treatment for leukocytosis as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's abdominal compartment syndrome and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to follow the patient's lab results and adjust treatment as necessary.

The patient should be closely monitored in the ICU, and the plan of care should be adjusted as necessary based on the patient's response to treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   -fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Will give vitamin K 5mg IV x 1 now
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - bolus 1 liter of fluid now and monitor UOP

   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. He has a mechanical aortic valve and was on coumadin with lovenox bridge. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his INR was slightly supratherapeutic at 4.2 on admission. He has received multiple blood products and IV fluids, but his blood pressure remains low, and he is experiencing tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient has a history of CAD, CABG, and hypertension, and is taking multiple medications, including simvastatin, atrovent, omeprazole, and iron. He has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids and blood products.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's INR is still slightly supratherapeutic, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage due to hypovolemia and bleeding.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia may be indicative of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
5. Infection: The patient's Foley catheter and multiple blood transfusions increase his risk of infection.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and bleeding may be indicative of a coagulopathy.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's multiple blood transfusions and IV fluids may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
8. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's distended abdomen and elevated lactate may be indicative of abdominal compartment syndrome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and bleeding, and consider further interventions to control the bleeding.
2. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider further interventions to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further interventions to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider further interventions to prevent respiratory complications.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider further interventions to prevent infection.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further interventions to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
7. Consider further interventions to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome, such as decompression of the abdomen."

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS:
               -         Seems hypovolemic with low urine output.  Will
   give more aggressive IVF - 1L NS bolus now
               -         Will give IV vitamin K - 5mg, continue to keep
   INR <2, and keep Hct >25, platelets > 50, fibrinogen ok.
               -         continue to monitor bladder pressures
   Acute renal failure:  due to hypovolemia and dye load.  Continue HCO3
   drip, and IVF go get urine output up.
   Afib:  HR under good control.
   Leukocytosis:  likely due to stress from bleed.  No evidence of
   infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and was admitted with a spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) in the setting of an international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.2. Despite receiving 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) continued to drop. An interventional radiology (IR) procedure was performed last night, but an arterial source could not be located. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for hypovolemia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding and hypovolemia put him at risk for hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if his hypovolemia is not adequately managed, leading to further compromise of his renal function.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypovolemia increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of underlying infection, which could worsen his condition if not properly treated.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 4.2 and ongoing bleeding suggest a coagulopathy, which may require further management with vitamin K and other coagulation factors.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if his hypovolemia is not managed, leading to respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's distended and tender abdomen, along with his hypovolemia, increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and hemodynamic status. Aggressive management of his hypovolemia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation is crucial to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced significant respiratory distress, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever has been managed with antibiotics, and pressors have been initiated to maintain a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including CK and CK-MB, with flat troponins, suggesting possible intra-abdominal process contributing to muscle necrosis. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 66-73%, indicating possible tissue hypoxia.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's intubation and sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature and laboratory results suggest possible sepsis. Prompt identification and management of the underlying infection are crucial to prevent further organ dysfunction.
3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is precarious, and there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid management are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Pain Control: The patient's pain management is critical, and there is a risk of inadequate pain control leading to further distress and organ dysfunction.
5. Ineffective Coping: The patient's coping mechanisms are limited due to their critical illness, and there is a risk of ineffective coping leading to further distress and organ dysfunction.
6. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient's retroperitoneal bleed is a concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding or organ damage if not managed promptly.
7. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and there is a risk of further cardiac damage if not managed promptly.
8. Intra-abdominal Process: The patient's laboratory results suggest possible intra-abdominal process contributing to muscle necrosis. Prompt identification and management of the underlying process are crucial to prevent further organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, electrolyte levels, and fluid balance.
2. Promptly identify and manage the underlying infection to prevent further organ dysfunction.
3. Optimize pain control to prevent further distress and organ dysfunction.
4. Monitor the patient's coping mechanisms and provide emotional support as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's retroperitoneal bleed and cardiac enzyme elevation.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's intra-abdominal process to prevent further organ dysfunction.
7. Consult with the patient's primary care physician and other specialists as needed to ensure comprehensive care."

 FEVER - 101.2
F - [**2142-5-16**] 09:00 PM
   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need
   additional reversal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Discoloration of skin apparent.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
 discuss value of tagged RBC scan to identify ? site of
   bleeding
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - Held statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome. Surgical team continues to feel no
   role for surgery at this time as patient not meeting surgical criteria
   for compartment syndrome. The criteria would be:
   1)       Anuria or very low UOP
   2)       Bladder pressures > 25-30 (may be unreliable in setting of
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   3)       PIP > 30
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors
   # Communication: Patient; sister [**Name (NI) 12205**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12206**] is HCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Discoloration of skin apparent.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
 discuss value of tagged RBC scan to identify ? site of
   bleeding
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - Held statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome. Surgical team continues to feel no
   role for surgery at this time as patient not meeting surgical criteria
   for compartment syndrome. The criteria would be:
   1)       Anuria or very low UOP
   2)       Bladder pressures > 25-30 (may be unreliable in setting of
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   3)       PIP > 30
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted with subtherapeutic INR, retroperitoneal hematoma, and mechanical aortic valve. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, CAD, COPD, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, with increasing respiratory distress, hypotension, and bleeding. He was intubated and placed on pressors, and a CVL was inserted. The patient has received multiple units of blood products and IVF, but his Hct remains low. He has developed acute renal failure, rising CKs, and tachyarrhythmia. The patient is at risk for compartment syndrome, and the surgical team is monitoring his condition closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding may continue, leading to further blood loss, hypovolemia, and organ failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening azotemia and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiogenic shock.
5. Infection: The patient's bleeding and trauma may have introduced bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of sepsis and infection.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient's increasing abdominal pressure and bleeding may lead to compartment syndrome, which could result in organ failure and death.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's rising CKs and hypokalemia may lead to hyperkalemia, which could result in cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
8. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's blood loss and hypovolemia may lead to hypovolemic shock, which could result in organ failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding with blood products and IVF, and consider consulting interventional radiology for further management.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medications as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider consulting cardiology for further management.
5. Consider consulting infectious disease for further management of the patient's potential infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pressure and consider consulting general surgery for further management.
7. Consider consulting nephrology for further management of the patient's hyperkalemia.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as needed to prevent hypovolemic shock."

   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need
   additional reversal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # Retroperitoneal bleed. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Patient with elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, CKs, and
   bladder pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General
   Surgery and Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal
   mngt at this time.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 27; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox and send factor XA level
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Coordinate w/ IR whether tagged RBC scan or CT abdomen (non-con)
   would be more helpful to eval for bleeding
   - Coordinate with gen surgery, vascular [**Doctor First Name 458**] possible operative
   management in setting of concern for compartment syndrome
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome.   Patient with elevated PIP,
   worsening creatinine, oliguria, elevated CKs, and bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General Surgery and
   Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal mngt.  We
   are coordinating with these teams at this time.
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys rather than hypovolemia.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Trend bladder pressures, CK, lactate
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - D/C statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   ..
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors
   # Communication: Patient; sister [**Name (NI) 12205**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12206**] is HCP
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - PM Hct 23 (from 25) after 1 unit of pRBCs in AM; ordered for 1
   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need
   additional reversal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # Retroperitoneal bleed. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Patient with elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, CKs, and
   bladder pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General
   Surgery and Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal
   mngt at this time.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 27; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox and send factor XA level
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Coordinate w/ IR whether tagged RBC scan or CT abdomen (non-con)
   would be more helpful to eval for bleeding
   - Coordinate with gen surgery, vascular [**Doctor First Name 458**] possible operative
   management in setting of concern for compartment syndrome
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome.   Patient with elevated PIP,
   worsening creatinine, oliguria, elevated CKs, and bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General Surgery and
   Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal mngt.  We
   are coordinating with these teams at this time.
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys rather than hypovolemia.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Trend bladder pressures, CK, lactate
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - D/C statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   ..
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve, admitted for subtherapeutic INR, who presents with 2 days of low back pain and found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient has a complex medical history, including a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a pressure support trial. The PIP is being monitored to assess for compartment syndrome.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, which has been corrected with 4 units of FFP. The patient is on coumadin with a lovenox bridge, and the INR is now normalized at 1.2. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being monitored for tachyarrhythmias.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.7, likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to the kidneys. The patient is being monitored for urine output and is receiving IVF for oliguria.
* Hematological: The patient has a rising WBC count, possibly related to bleeding and multiple transfusions. The patient has a fever and is being treated with Tylenol.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is being monitored for bleeding and infection.
* Infection: The patient has a sputum culture pending, and pus was noted at the Foley site, suggesting one source of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Compartment syndrome: The patient's elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, oliguria, and elevated CKs suggest the possibility of compartment syndrome.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's rising creatinine and oliguria suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's fever and pus at the Foley site suggest the possibility of infection.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increase the risk of cardiac complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Monitoring of laboratory values, including creatinine, WBC count, and coagulation studies.
* Monitoring of urine output and electrolytes.
* Treatment of fever with Tylenol.
* Administration of IVF for oliguria.
* Monitoring of PIP and bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome.
* Coordination with general surgery, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology to determine optimal management of the patient's condition.
* Consultation with cardiology and pulmonology as needed.
* Monitoring for tachyarrhythmias and cardiac complications.
* Monitoring for respiratory complications and adjusting mechanical ventilation as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and a recent right-sided pulmonary embolism (RP) bleed in the setting of coagulopathy. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he is showing signs of abdominal compartment syndrome, including rising CK and lactate levels. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, with a urine output decrease. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's rising CK and lactate levels suggest a high risk of abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can further exacerbate his already critical condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and his oxygen saturation levels are stable but may continue to decline if not managed properly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a risk factor for bleeding complications, and his INR has normalized, which may indicate that his coagulopathy is improving.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
6. Deterioration of Neurological Status: The patient's neurological status is already compromised, and any further deterioration could have significant consequences.
7. Multi-Organ Dysfunction: The patient's critical condition and multiple organ dysfunction make him at high risk for further deterioration and potential death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive transfusion to aim for a hemoglobin level of 27.
2. Discuss the patient's condition with the IR team to determine the best course of action for managing his abdominal compartment syndrome.
3. Check factor Xa levels to determine if lovenox is still present and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Investigate the cause of the patient's acute renal failure and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
6. Consider antibiotics if the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential infection.
7. Closely monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed to prevent further deterioration.
8. Discuss the patient's condition with the general surgery team to determine the best course of action for managing his abdominal compartment syndrome and potential need for surgical intervention."
