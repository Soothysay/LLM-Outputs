   presents from surgical floor for persistent hypotension. Patient
   underwent planned procedure on [**2176-8-30**] that was without complication.
   Patient received minimal intra-operative fluid [**1-20**] planned bowel
   reanastamosis and desire to avoid bowel intraoperatively. Post-op
   patient received 4L LR, 2u PRBCs and remained hypotensive on the floor
   overnight.

   On the am of transfer, patient was continuing to be hypotensive despite
   IVF resuscitation and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for closer
   monitoring. HCT stable.  Pt was put on cefazolin and flagyl.
   .
   On arrival to the floor, pt persistently hypotensive with SBP in 80s,
   tachycardiac to 110-120.  WBC count 13.1 with a left shift.  EKG showed
   sinus tachycardia but otherwise unchanged from baseline.
   .
   ROS: + nausea, [**1-28**] RLQ pain. The patient denies any fevers, chills,
   vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea,
   PND, lower extremity oedema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency,

   MEDICAL ATTENDING ADMIT ADDENDUM
   I examined the patient and reiviewed his history and pertinent labs.  I
   was physically present with the MICU team during the key portions of
   the services provided. I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the following:
   The patient has expected post op pain,  clearly improved with PCA, and
   has little other complaints.  His normal SBP is 110.
   On exam: His SBP is in the 80s and HR in the 120s, though he looks very
   comfortable other than his abdomen. Lungs clear.  Cor- RRR but tachy;
   Ext- no edema; Neuro
 a&o GU- scant urine in Foley; Abd
 as above
   thin brownish fluid saturating the gauze dressing of one of his wounds
   Lab: as above.  CxR
 clear except for +/- LLL atelectasis
   \
   Problems:
   1.       S/p ex lap and take down of entero cutaneous fistulae with
   ileostomy
   2.       Post op hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria
 abdominal
   sepsis vs volume depletion from gut third space losses vs both
   3.       Hx of multiple cancers ( GB, appendix, gastric, colon)
   Plan:
   1.       Aggressive IV fluids, aiming for UO> 30cc/hr and SBP>90
   2.       Agree with A line
   3.       Agree with change in antibiotics to Zosyn and Vanco
   4.       [**Month (only) 51**] need central line , but for now his SCL portacath and 16 g
   PIV are sufficing for IVF
   5.       Appreciate surgery following his wound closely, esp what they
   believe is a seroma draining
   6.       Recheck CXR if any  increased SOB
   7.       Consider serum cortisol if BP doesn
t respond to 4-6 L of
   fluids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, s/p right colectomy, fistula takedown, and resection of anastamosis. He was admitted to the ICU for persistent hypotension despite IV fluid resuscitation. He has a rising WBC count and is tachycardic, with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s. He has a tender abdomen with a wet packing and pooling seroma, and an ostomy bag with minimal output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count and tachycardia suggest the possibility of septic shock, which could be caused by an anastamotic leak, surgical site infection, or line infection.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could also be caused by hypovolemic shock due to blood loss or third-space losses from the gut.
3. Abdominal sepsis: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and rising WBC count suggest the possibility of abdominal sepsis, which could be caused by an anastamotic leak, surgical site infection, or intra-abdominal abscess.
4. Anastamotic leak: The patient's history of colon cancer and fistula takedown make an anastamotic leak a possible complication.
5. Surgical site infection: The patient's rising WBC count and tachycardia suggest the possibility of a surgical site infection.
6. Line infection: The patient's central line and PIV lines increase the risk of line infection.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension could also be caused by cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac tamponade.

Plan:

1. Trend serial lactates to monitor for septic shock.
2. Administer IV fluids to goal UOP 30 cc/hr and SBP >90.
3. Transfuse for Hct > 30.
4. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, switch to vanc/zosyn.
5. Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
6. Trend WBC count and fever curve.
7. Surgery to relook at anastamosis.
8. Place A-line.
9. Monitor and replete electrolytes.
10. Consider repeat imaging for anastamotic leak in setting of rising WBC and hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

* The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, s/p right colectomy, and fistula takedown.
* He presents to the ICU with persistent hypotension, despite IV fluid resuscitation, and is tachycardic with a rising WBC count.
* The patient has a history of persistent drain output from an abscess fistula and has undergone a planned procedure on 8/30/2176 without complication.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 82/61 mmHg.
* The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress, and a midline incision with wet packing, pooling seroma, and ostomy bag in place with minimal output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension may indicate septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's history of colon cancer and fistula takedown increases the risk of anastomotic leak, which can lead to sepsis and further complications.
3. Surgical Site Infection: The patient's history of surgery and wound drainage increases the risk of surgical site infection, which can lead to sepsis and further complications.
4. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and tachycardia may indicate hypovolemic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of fluid resuscitation and electrolyte imbalance increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of surgery and respiratory support increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's history of surgery and fluid resuscitation increases the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of surgery and cardiovascular disease increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential medical complications and provide timely interventions to prevent further complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient and reviewed his history and relevant labs.
   I was physically present with the MICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided and I agree with the above note, including its
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   Over the past 24 hrs the pt required levophed as 6 L of fluid did not
   result in sustained improvement in U.O or BP.  On Levophed these both
   improved.  Patient still has abd pain, but no other complaints.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient and reviewed his history and relevant labs.
   I was physically present with the MICU team for the key portions of the
   services provided and I agree with the above note, including its
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   Over the past 24 hrs the pt required levophed as 6 L of fluid did not
   result in sustained improvement in U.O or BP.  On Levophed these both
   improved.  Patient still has abd pain, but no other complaints.
   Remains on Zosyn and Vanco
   On exam: afeb, BP= 106/75,  Sat=96% on 2L  I/O = + 6L over 24 hrs.  U.O

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent a resection of anastomosis and fistula takedown. He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, increased white blood cell count, and acute renal failure.

The patient has received multiple fluid boluses, pressors, and antibiotics, and is currently on norepinephrine and albumin. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg, heart rate of 97 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, overweight/obese, and anxious. His abdomen is soft, distended, and tender, with wounds that look clear.

Laboratory results show an increase in white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen, indicating acute renal failure. His hemoglobin level has decreased, and his platelet count is low.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Post-operative hypotension, likely due to third spacing into the abdomen, bleeding into the abdomen, and/or abdominal sepsis.
2. Acute renal failure, likely due to decreased blood pressure.
3. Anemia, in part due to dilution.
4. Post-operative pain.

The plan of care includes:

1. Slow IV fluids to avoid overhydration.
2. Continued current antibiotics.
3. Blood transfusion to address anemia.
4. Check chest X-ray to rule out pulmonary complications.
5. Wean norepinephrine to minimize pressor dependence.
6. Increase PCA for post-operative pain control.
7. Monitor hemoglobin and creatinine levels.
8. Close follow-up with the surgical team.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent resection of anastomosis, fistula takedown, and fistula resection due to a persistent drain output from an abscess fistula. He developed hypotension, increased WBC, and acute renal failure (ARF) post-operatively. He requires pressors and fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure. His wounds appear clear, and he has tender abdomen without worsening. He is currently on antibiotics and has a portacath inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's increasing WBC and hypotension, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Anastomotic leak: Although the patient's wounds appear clear, there is still a possibility of anastomotic leak, which can lead to further complications.
3. Oliguric acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's ARF may be due to hypotension during surgery, and oliguric ATN is a possible complication.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypotension and ARF may lead to electrolyte imbalance, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula and SpO2 of 96% indicates that he may be at risk for respiratory complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tender abdomen and NPO status may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Infection: The patient's increasing WBC and hypotension may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
8. Renal failure: The patient's ARF may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and pressor requirement may indicate cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue fluid boluses PRN to maintain blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC, temperature, and creatinine levels closely.
3. Consider repeat imaging for anastomotic leak in the setting of rising WBC and hypotension.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as needed.
5. Consider repeat imaging for gastrointestinal complications.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust pressor therapy as needed.
8. Consider consultation with a nephrologist for further management of ARF."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-operative patient who underwent fistula resection and is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and increased WBC count. The patient has been receiving multiple fluid boluses, pressors, and antibiotics. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and indwelling port (PortaCath) in place. Lab results show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, with normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has received multiple fluid boluses, which may lead to fluid overload and worsen their hypotension.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which could worsen their overall condition.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may recur due to their medications or underlying conditions.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to their immobility and the presence of central lines.
8. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer bleeding due to their critical illness and medications.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and catheters may increase their risk of infection."

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent resection of anastomosis and fistula takedown. He is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, rising WBC count, and concerns for septic or hypovolemic shock. He has been receiving multiple fluid boluses, pressors, and antibiotics. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg. He has a distended abdomen, no bowel sounds, and tender wounds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest a possible septic etiology, which may be due to an anastomotic leak, surgical site infection, or line infection.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hypotension and rising lactate levels suggest a possible hypovolemic shock, which may be due to inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing blood loss.
3. Anastomotic leak: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest a possible anastomotic leak, which may be causing a septic response.
4. Surgical site infection: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest a possible surgical site infection, which may be causing a septic response.
5. Line infection: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest a possible line infection, which may be causing a septic response.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's distended abdomen and lack of bowel sounds suggest a possible respiratory compromise, which may be exacerbated by his hypotension.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest a possible cardiac complication, which may be exacerbated by his hypovolemic shock.
8. Renal complications: The patient's rising lactate levels and hypotension suggest a possible renal complication, which may be exacerbated by his hypovolemic shock.
9. Metabolic complications: The patient's rising glucose levels and hypotension suggest a possible metabolic complication, which may be exacerbated by his hypovolemic shock.

Plan:

1. Trend serial lactates to monitor for septic or hypovolemic shock.
2. Administer IV fluids to goal UOP 30 cc/hr, SBP >90, MAP >65.
3. Transfuse for Hct > 30.
4. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, switch cefazolin/flagyl to vanc/zosyn.
5. Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
6. Trend WBC count and fever curve.
7. Surgery to relook at anastamosis.
8. Place an arterial line.
9. Monitor and replete electrolytes.
10. Consider repeat imaging for anastomotic leak in setting of rising WBC and hypotension."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent a colectomy and fistula takedown procedure on POD #3. He is currently in the ICU due to persistent drain output from an abscess fistula and post-operative hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 84/64 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mEq/L. His white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, and his hemoglobin (Hct) is stable at 26.1%. His platelet count is normal, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended and tender abdomen, but his wounds appear clean and dry. He has no signs of fever or chills, and his respiratory status is stable.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue fluid boluses as needed for hypotension
* Discontinue vancomycin and add linezolid for the abscess fistula
* Follow up blood cultures
* Monitor fever curve, WBC, and Hct
* Follow surgery recommendations, likely transferring to the floor today

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis due to the abscess fistula and post-operative hypotension
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension during surgery
* Oliguric ATN due to decreased urine output
* Electrolyte imbalance due to fluid and electrolyte shifts
* Wound infection or dehiscence due to the abscess fistula

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure his safe transfer to the floor."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, receiving multiple interventions to manage their condition. They have undergone fluid boluses to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and pressors were initially used, but have since been discontinued. The patient has received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to correct anemia, with a current hemoglobin (Hct) of 26%. The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is resolving, with a current creatinine (Cr) of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors. They have a central line, arterial line, and indwelling port for medication administration and monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 82 x 10^9/L, and lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid in the past 24 hours, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and recent transfusion of PRBCs may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of invasive lines and devices may increase the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Renal failure: Although the patient's AKI is resolving, they may be at risk for further kidney injury or failure.
5. Metabolic derangements: The patient's altered metabolic state may lead to electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's recent use of pressors and fluid boluses may have caused cardiovascular instability, which may be exacerbated by further fluid administration or medication changes.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of sedatives and paralytics may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures."

   Ex-lap, fistula takedown, resection of anastamosis [**2176-8-30**]
   .
   Plan:
   # Post-operative Hypotension- Patient with increasing WBC, acute renal
   failure and pressor requirement s/p major GI surgery. Concern for SIRS
   after surgery and/or sepsis. Patient with very tender abdomen, that has
   not been worsening, so anastomotic leak is not that likely. Wounds look
   clear. Patient seems euvolemic for now and with low O2 requirements,
   currently on antibiotics.
   -          Continue fluid boluses PRN
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn (Day 2)
   -          Follow up blood cultures
   -          Follow up temp curve
   -          Follow up WBC
   -          Touch-base with surgery
   -          Transuse 1 RBC unit
   -          PM lytes and PM HCT
   #ARF: Patient with new acute renal failure (creatinine increase >0.5).
   Most likely due to hypotension during surgery. Patient most likely on
   oliguic ATN, but volume needs to be monitored as well as BP to make
   sure perfusion is adequate.
   -          F/u urine lytes
   -          F/u UA looking for granular casts
   -          Trend creatinine
   -          F/u UOP
   .
   # Colon CA s/p colectomy and fistula takedown: POD#1
   - dilaudid PCA for post-operative pain control. Increase pain control.
   - keep NPO until bowel functioning
   - consider repeat imaging for anastamotic leak in setting of rising WBC
   and hypotension
   .
   # FEN: NPO until bowels start to move, monitor and replete lytes
   .
   # Access: right Port, PIV x1 16g, 20g
   .
   # PPx: hep sc BID, PPI, pneumoboots.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer and s/p R colectomy, fistula takedown, and resection of anastomosis. The patient is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, acute renal failure, and pressor requirements.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130s and a heart rate of 95-103 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97%, and he is not requiring supplemental oxygen. His abdominal examination is tender, but not worsening, and his wounds appear clear.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including acute renal failure, sepsis, and hypotension. He is receiving antibiotics, fluid boluses, and vasopressors, and his blood cultures are pending. He is also at risk for anastomotic leak and bowel obstruction.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 120. His creatinine level is 1.0, and his glucose level is 104 mg/dL.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and he is receiving antibiotics. He is also at risk for anastomotic leak and bowel obstruction, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and he is at risk for acute kidney injury due to hypotension and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is not stable, and he is at risk for hypotension due to his medical conditions and medications.
4. Anastomotic leak: The patient is at risk for anastomotic leak due to his medical history and current condition.
5. Bowel obstruction: The patient is at risk for bowel obstruction due to his medical history and current condition.
6. SIRS: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and he is at risk for SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to his medical conditions and antibiotics.
7. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and he is at risk for ARF (acute renal failure) due to hypotension and sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a number of medical complications, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, hypotension, anastomotic leak, bowel obstruction, SIRS, and ARF. He requires close monitoring and management of his medical conditions to prevent these complications and ensure his safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   post-procedure. Patients abdominal exam has improved, wounds appear
   clean and WBC is trending down. He has also been afebrile. Abdominal
   wound cx grew enterococcus, otherwise all other cultures are negative
   to date.
   -          Continue fluid boluses PRN for hypotension.
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn (Day 3)
   -          Follow up blood cultures
   -          Monitor fever curve, WBC and hct.

   #ARF: Most likely due to hypotension during surgery. His creatinine has
   improved with fluid rescusitation, now close to or at baseline. Patient
   most likely in oliguic ATN (given FeNa >0.3 showing prerenal etiology),
   but volume needs to be monitored as well as BP to make sure perfusion
   is adequate. Continues to have borderline UOP.
   - F/u UA looking for granular casts

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, status post-right colectomy, and persistent drain output from an abscess fistula. The patient has undergone fistula takedown and resection of anastomosis three days prior.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 95 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient has received multiple fluid boluses for hypotension, and his blood pressure has improved to 130s. He has also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to a hematocrit of 26%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.1-16.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.9-26.4%
* Platelet count: 120-111 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3-1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 104-92 mg/dL
* Glucose: 156-92 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* LDH: 158 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Sepsis
* Post-operative hypotension
* Abdominal abscess fistula
* Enterococcus infection

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing fluid boluses for hypotension
* Continuing vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics
* Following up blood cultures
* Monitoring fever curve, white blood cell count, and hematocrit
* Following surgery recommendations for transfer to the floor
* Monitoring blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urine output
* Bolusing fluids as needed to maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* ARF progression
* Hypovolemic shock
* Hypertensive crisis
* GI bleeding
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection
* Wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence
* Nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalance
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, post-operative hypotension, and acute renal failure. He has been on pressors for 24 hours and has had adequate volume support, which has improved his hemodynamics. He has been able to maintain stability off pressors. The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as anticoagulation with heparin. He is also receiving pain management with PCA.

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for continued sepsis and SIRS, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may not be fully resolved, and further monitoring of urine output is needed.
3. VRE: The patient has preliminary findings of VRE on culture, which could lead to treatment failure and increased risk of infection.
4. Colon Cancer: The patient has colon cancer and is at risk for complications related to the disease and treatment.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
6. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and invasive lines.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and invasive procedures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as ordered.
3. Monitor urine output and adjust fluid management accordingly.
4. Discuss the addition of Linezolid for VRE treatment with the surgical team.
5. Monitor the patient's pain management and adjust as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
7. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent DVT and VAP."
