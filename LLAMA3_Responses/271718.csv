   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status:  Differential diagnosis includes primary
   neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage versus
   hepatitic encephalopathy in the setting of trauma.  Other potential
   etiologies to worsen known encephalopathy include infection and GI
   bleeding. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool cultures
   sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Details unclear.  Secondary to alcohol abuse.
   Still drinking.  Unclear baseline hepatic function. Known history of
   ascites and encephalopathy.  Hepatology is following.
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 46-year-old male, is a trauma patient with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the trauma service on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He was transferred to the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection, now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Stable on two subsequent CT scans, with neurosurgery following.
* End-stage liver disease: Details unclear, secondary to alcohol abuse. Hepatology is following.
* GI bleed: Guaiac positive, Hct trending down, but recent stools not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage appears stable on repeat CT's.
* Anemia/? DIC: Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes, elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC.
* Transverse process fractures: Non-operative, no further management needed.
* Shallow toe ulcer: No signs of current infection, local wound care.
* Peripheral arterial disease: Dopplerable pulses, healing ulcer on right great toe, local wound care.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* WBC: 6.6-7.0 K/uL
* Hct: 20.8-26.0%
* Plt: 85-98 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 26-27 mmHg
* Glucose: 131-174 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 19.3/37.7/1.8, ALT/AST: 23/43, Alk Phos/T Bili: 119/20.0, Differential-Neuts: 64.9%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 23.9%, Mono: 8.7%, Eos: 2.3%, D-dimer: [**Numeric Identifier 9337**] ng/mL, Fibrinogen: 199 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.8 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of trauma, respiratory failure, and altered mental status, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stools and low Hct suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen his anemia and increase his risk of bleeding complications.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status increase his risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen his mental status and increase his risk of bleeding complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as pneumonia and respiratory acidosis.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of bleeding complications.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage with dilantin and target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, and SBP < 160.
* Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions and target Hct > 21, platelets > 80, and INR < 1.5.
* Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his therapy as necessary to prevent further bleeding complications.
* Consider broadening the patient's antibiotic coverage if he develops fever or other signs of infection.
* Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of his end-stage liver disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He was transferred to the MICU service for management of ESLD and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: He is intubated and receiving nasal cannula oxygen, with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The hemorrhage appears stable on repeat CT scans, and neurosurgery is following his case.
* Cirrhosis of the liver: The patient has ESLD, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal.
* Trauma: He has multiple fractures, including transverse process fractures, which are non-operative.
* Shallow toe ulcer: The ulcer is not infected and is being managed with local wound care.
* Peripheral arterial disease: The patient has Dopplerable pulses, and the ulcer on his right great toe is not infected.
* Diabetes mellitus type 2: He is on SSI.
* Fluid and electrolyte management: The patient is receiving IV fluids and electrolytes, and his diet is regular.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Further bleeding, increased intracranial pressure, and potential for neurological deterioration.
* Cirrhosis of the liver: Hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding varices.
* Trauma: Infection, sepsis, and potential for further complications from his multiple fractures.
* Shallow toe ulcer: Infection, cellulitis, and potential for further complications if not managed properly.
* Peripheral arterial disease: Infection, gangrene, and potential for further complications if not managed properly.
* Diabetes mellitus type 2: Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and potential for further complications if not managed properly.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.6-7.0 K/uL
* Hct: 20.8-26.0%
* Plt: 72-85 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 26-27 mmHg
* Glucose: 131-174 mg/dL
* ALT: 23 U/L
* AST: 43 U/L
* Alk Phos: 119 U/L
* T Bili: 20.0 mg/dL
* D-dimer: 9337 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 199 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* RUQ u/s: Persistent CBD dilatation, persistent cholelithiasis, and portal hypertension.
* MRI abdomen: Cholelithiasis, extensive dilatation of intra and extra-hepatic bile ducts, and potential for pancreatitis.
* CT head: Stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
* CT thorax: No traumatic injury to the abdomen or pelvis, cirrhosis, and evidence of portal hypertension.

The patient's medications include:

* Lactulose
* Rifaximin
* Ceftriaxone
* Azithromycin
* Fentanyl
* Insulin
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Diazepam (Valium)
* Dilantin

The patient's plan of care includes:

* NGT in place for Lactulose
* Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
* Start Rifaximin
* Get RUQ u/s this am
* Obtain MRCP once able to lay still
* Blood and urine cultures pending
* Stool Cdiff pending
* Neurosurgical consult
* F/u with hepatology today
* IV PPI
* RUQ ultrasound today
* Holding diuretics
* Aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
* Aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma,
   infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool
   cultures sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Outside records without evidence of HepB or C
   infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well. Thought now to
   be secondary to alcohol abuse.  Still drinking.  Unclear baseline
   hepatic function.
   - F/u with hepatology today
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
 needs to be followed up
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease who was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. He was transferred to the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: He is intubated for airway protection and is breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR.
* Cirrhosis of the liver: He has evidence of portal hypertension, cholelithiasis, and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: He has a stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage on repeat CT scans, and neurosurgery is following.
* Altered mental status: He has altered mental status, which may be due to primary neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage, hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma, infection, or GI bleed.
* Anemia/DIC: He has low haptoglobin, small schistocytes, and elevated d-dimer, which may indicate DIC, although this is difficult to assess in patients with liver disease.
* GI bleed: He has guaiac-positive stools, but recent stools are not bright red nor melenic, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage appears stable on repeat CT scans.
* Trauma: He has multiple fractures, including transverse process fractures, which are non-operative.
* Other medical conditions: He has peripheral arterial disease, shallow toe ulcer, and DM2.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, ARDS, or other respiratory complications.
* Cirrhosis of the liver: Hepatic encephalopathy, GI bleed, or other complications related to liver disease.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Further bleeding, neurologic complications, or death.
* Altered mental status: Worsening of encephalopathy, seizures, or other neurologic complications.
* Anemia/DIC: Further bleeding, organ failure, or death.
* GI bleed: Further bleeding, GI perforation, or other complications related to GI bleed.
* Trauma: Further injury or complications related to trauma.
* Other medical conditions: Complications related to peripheral arterial disease, shallow toe ulcer, or DM2.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Continue to monitor his respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Manage his liver disease with lactulose and rifaximin, and consider further interventions such as RUQ ultrasound and MRCP.
* Monitor his coagulopathy and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further bleeding.
* Monitor his mental status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent worsening of encephalopathy.
* Monitor his anemia and DIC and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further bleeding and organ failure.
* Monitor his GI bleed and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further bleeding and GI perforation.
* Monitor his trauma and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further injury.
* Monitor his other medical conditions and adjust therapy as needed to prevent complications.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and he will be followed closely by the MICU service and other specialists as needed."

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 TRAUMA, S/P
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 46 year old male with a history of
   alcohol abuse and end stage liver disease who was admitted to the
   trauma serivce on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home
   and suffering multiple fractures now transferred to the MICU service
   for management of end stage liver disease and altered mental status.
   Altered Mental Status: DDx: primary neurologic processes related to his
   intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma,
   infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool
   cultures sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic, in the past
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Outside records without evidence of HepB or C
   infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well. Thought now to
   be secondary to alcohol abuse.  Still drinking.  Unclear baseline
   hepatic function.
   - F/u with hepatology today
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
 needs to be followed up
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Heme consult
   - Look through OSH records and establish baseline Hct
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult
   DM2: On SSI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Not on subQ heparin given above issues

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   infection, or GI bleed. Blood and urine cultures are pending.  No stool
   cultures sent.  No ascites on abdominal CT for paracentesis.
   - NGT in place for Lactulose currently getting, titrate to [**2-11**] stools
   per day per liver recs
   - Keep NPO and use NGT for all meds
   - Have started Rifaximin
   - Will get RUQ u/s this am but per OSH notes, has had persistent
   biliary tree duct dilatation, intra and extra hepatic, in the past
   - Will obtain MRCP once able to lay still
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - stool Cdiff pending
   - per neuro surgery will attempt to maintain SBP < 160, INR < 1.5, Plts
   > 80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage
   - appreciate neurosurgical consult
   End stage liver disease: Outside records without evidence of HepB or C
   infection, some autoimmune serologies negative as well. Thought now to
   be secondary to alcohol abuse.  Still drinking.  Unclear baseline
   hepatic function.
   - F/u with hepatology today
   - IV PPI
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - holding diuretics
   - aggressive lactulose/rifaximin
   - aggressive control of coagulopathy given intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   Concern for GI Bleed: Was guaic positive and Hct trending down.  Recent
   stools are not bright red nor melenic. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
   appears stable on repeat CT's.
   - Has 18g and 20g x2
   - Keep active T&S --> send new one today
   - Hct's [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for active bleeding or Hct <21
   - Try to maintain INR <1.5 and Plts >80 although will be difficult in
   liver pt
   Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia:  Patient intubated for airway
   protection.  Now breathing well on nasal cannula with evidence of new
   infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   - ceftriaxone/azithromycin for pneumonia, day [**1-17**]
   - consider broadening coverage if pt spikes fevers
   Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: Now stable on two subsequent CT scans.
   Neurosurgery is following.
   - continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis
   - dilantin level in the AM
 needs to be followed up
   - Q4H neurochecks
   - repeat head CT in AM
   - will target INR < 1.5, platelets > 80, SBP < 160
   Anemia/? DIC:  Patient with low haptoglobin, small schistocytes,
   elevated d-dimer, concerning for DIC although this is difficult to
   assess in patient's with liver disease. Patient also with grossly
   guaiac positive stools with negative NG lavage.
   - Heme consult
   - Look through OSH records and establish baseline Hct
   - Send for manual smear
   - Q8H hematocrits, platelets, coags
   - will treat with platelets, FFP, PRBCs as necessary, as above
   - goals hct > 21, platelets > 80, INR < 1.5
    Transverse Process Fractures: Per surgery are non-operative.  Does not
   need cervical collar or log roll precautions.
   - no further management needed
   Shallow Toe Ulcer: No signs of current infection.
   - local wound care
    Peripheral Arterial Disease: Dopplerable pulses.  Healing ulcer on
   right great toe which does not appear infected.
   - local wound care
   - consider vascular consult
   DM2: On SSI
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Not on subQ heparin given above issues
   Access: 2 peripherals, arterial line
   Code:  Full
   Communication: Patient, [**Name (NI) 2255**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9357**].  Other family numbers:
   [**Doctor First Name 1515**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9358**], and [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9359**]
   Disposition: If stable through today can likely call out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted to the trauma service after falling down the stairs and suffering multiple fractures. The patient is currently in the MICU service for management of end-stage liver disease and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on nasal cannula with evidence of new infiltrate on CXR.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage on repeat CT scans, and neurosurgery is following.
* Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, and the differential diagnosis includes primary neurologic processes related to his intracranial hemorrhage versus hepatitic encephalopathy due to trauma, infection, or GI bleed.
* End-stage liver disease: The patient has end-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol abuse, and he is still drinking.
* GI bleed: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, and there is concern for GI bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in oxygenation and ventilation.
* Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient's intraparenchymal hemorrhage can worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological sequelae.
* GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed can worsen, leading to further decline in hemoglobin and potential need for transfusion.
* Anemia/DIC: The patient's anemia and DIC can worsen, leading to further decline in hemoglobin and potential need for transfusion.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly given his immunocompromised state and presence of invasive lines.
* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, particularly given his immunocompromised state and presence of invasive lines.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver failure can worsen, leading to further decline in liver function and potential need for transplantation.
* Kidney failure: The patient's kidney failure can worsen, leading to further decline in kidney function and potential need for dialysis.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications, particularly given his underlying liver disease and potential need for transfusion.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."
