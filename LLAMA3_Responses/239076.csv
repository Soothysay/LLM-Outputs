   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP.
   - wean off pressors with goal MAP >60
   - continue with IVF, bolus to OUP >50cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <27
   - continue  vanc, cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment pending
   culture data and final read of CT
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding.
   - NPO, NGT in place
   - coordinate care with GI and surgery
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <27
   - hold Coumadin for now
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   -          continue cipro/flagyl as above
   -          serial abdominal exams
   -          F/U final imaging read
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has a PICC line inserted for access and is receiving antibiotics for peritonitis treatment. The patient's condition is complicated by a suspected GI bleed, which is being treated with fluid resuscitation, pressure support, and transfusions. The patient also has a chronic SMV thrombus and is on anticoagulation medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is a high-risk complication that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate ongoing bleeding, and the patient's abdomen is distended, which may indicate perforation.
2. Peritonitis: The patient's peritonitis is a potential complication of the GI bleed, and the patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response.
3. SMV thrombus: The patient's chronic SMV thrombus is a potential source of bleeding, and the patient's anticoagulation medication may need to be adjusted based on the patient's bleeding risk.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a potential complication of the GI bleed and may require transfusions.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and temperature may indicate sepsis, which requires prompt treatment and management.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a potential complication of the GI bleed and may require vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia may require correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate pneumonia, which requires prompt treatment and management.
10. Septic shock: The patient's elevated WBC count and temperature may indicate septic shock, which requires prompt treatment and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleed with fluid resuscitation, pressure support, and transfusions.
3. Continue to treat the patient's peritonitis with antibiotics and serial abdominal exams.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation medication based on the patient's bleeding risk.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # GI bleed: has blood in NGT and then coffee ground emesis worrisome
   for new upper GI bleed.  Hct of [**5-9**] not reflect active, ongoing
   bleed.  Getting IVFs and 1u PRBCs now.  Has known gastric varices which
   could be the cause of the bleed.
   - GI consulted and aware of patient, likely need EGD today
   - NPO, NGT in place, will check placement and then keep to LIS
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - complete 1u PRBC transfusion
   - q4hr Hcts, transfuse for hct <27 or active bleeding
   - check lactate
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Hypotension: baseline SBPs in the 80s, but has low BP to 68/doppler
   today.  Is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although could
   be a sign of new early infection, PE, cardiogenic shock or adrenal
   insufficiency.  These etiologies are less likely, though.  He has
   remains afebrile and has no localizing infectious symptoms, although is
   difficult to interview.  Has known SMV clot and has been slightly
   subtherpeutic on his coumadin, so may have other clots and is at risk
   of PE but is not hypoxic or with leg swelling.  No hx of cardiac
   problems or signs of pulm edema suggesting cardiac failure.  And he has
   not been on chronic steroids.
   - fluid resuccitation with IVF boluses and 1u PRBCs for now
   - levofed pressors if needed with SBP goal > 75, MAP >55
   - blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   - continue cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment
   - broaden abx by adding vanco for potential line infection, although
   PICC line looks uninfected on exam
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   - CXR to look for pneumonia
   - KUB to look for obstruction or new obstruction
   - EKG and CEs to rule out cardiac cause
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: was initial presentation and thought to be due to
   peritonitis from microperforations and translocation.  Has had chronic
   abdominal pain this admission with intermittent large bowel
   obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.  Is passing gas
   and stooling.  Did have recent rectal tube for decompression, but fell
   out two nights ago.  Also has signs of chronic pancreatitis and an SMV
   as discussed below.  Pain could be from multiple etiologies.
   - serial abdominal exams
   - f/u final read of KUB, appears stable per HO read
   - abd pain seems at baseline
   - repeat CT abdomen to look for possible new microperf or abscess as
   source of infection, but just had CT two days ago that was stable and
   without obvious source
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
   - hold anticoagulation for thrombus as below
   - morphine PRN
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: ICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* GI bleed: The patient has blood in his NGT and coffee ground emesis, which is worrisome for a new upper GI bleed. His Hct is not reflecting active bleeding, and he is receiving IV fluids and 1u PRBCs.
* Hypotension: The patient's baseline SBPs are in the 80s, but he has a low BP of 68/doppler today. This is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although other etiologies such as new early infection, PE, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency are possible.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is thought to be due to peritonitis from microperforations and translocation, as well as chronic abdominal pain with intermittent large bowel obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.
* Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis on admission and is being treated with cipro/flagyl.
* SMV thrombus: The patient has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals and was on lovenox and coumadin. However, in the setting of GI bleed, anticoagulation has been held.
* Anemia: The patient has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies suggest iron deficiency.
* Nutrition: The patient has been receiving TPN and has been NPO due to GI bleeding. His albumin levels are hypoalbuminemic.
* Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder is stable, and he is receiving phenobarbitol and phenytoin.
* Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy is stable, and he is interactive with his family, although non-verbal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further GI bleeding
* Hypovolemic shock
* Infection (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia)
* Cardiogenic shock
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Perforation of the gut
* Abscess formation
* Pancreatitis
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Blood transfusion reaction

The patient's management plan includes:

* IV fluids and blood transfusions for hypovolemia and anemia
* Proton pump inhibitors for GI bleeding
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis and potential infection
* Hold anticoagulation for SMV thrombus
* Continue seizure medication
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and infection
* Consider EGD and endoscopy to evaluate the GI bleed and rule out other etiologies
* Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and consider imaging studies to evaluate for potential abscess or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with colonic wall thickening with possible bleed, RP hematoma, and microperforation. He is being treated for peritonitis, and his anticoagulation medication has been held due to the GI bleed. He is also being treated for anemia and has received blood transfusions. He is currently NPO, and his nutrition is being managed through TPN.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's bleeding is concerning, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the bleed and the best course of treatment.
2. Infection: The patient's peritonitis and possible GI bleed increase the risk of infection, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic bleeding and may require further transfusions.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to the GI bleed and may require further fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of respiratory failure in the setting of a GI bleed.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of cardiovascular complications in the setting of a GI bleed.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of neurological complications in the setting of a GI bleed.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary due to the risk of metabolic complications in the setting of a GI bleed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding with transfusions and vasopressor support as necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's peritonitis with antibiotics and consider consulting infectious disease if the workup is positive.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions and iron supplementation as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status closely.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's metabolic status closely.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist and/or a surgeon for further evaluation and management of the patient's GI bleed."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # GI bleed: has blood in NGT and then coffee ground emesis worrisome
   for new upper GI bleed.  Hct of [**5-9**] not reflect active, ongoing
   bleed.  Getting IVFs and 1u PRBCs now.  Has known gastric varices which
   could be the cause of the bleed.
   - GI consulted and aware of patient, likely need EGD today
   - NPO, NGT in place, will check placement and then keep to LIS
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - complete 1u PRBC transfusion
   - q4hr Hcts, transfuse for hct <27 or active bleeding
   - check lactate
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Hypotension: baseline SBPs in the 80s, but has low BP to 68/doppler
   today.  Is likely secondary to GI bleed and hypovolemia, although could
   be a sign of new early infection, PE, cardiogenic shock or adrenal
   insufficiency.  These etiologies are less likely, though.  He has
   remains afebrile and has no localizing infectious symptoms, although is
   difficult to interview.  Has known SMV clot and has been slightly
   subtherpeutic on his coumadin, so may have other clots and is at risk
   of PE but is not hypoxic or with leg swelling.  No hx of cardiac
   problems or signs of pulm edema suggesting cardiac failure.  And he has
   not been on chronic steroids.
   - fluid resuccitation with IVF boluses and 1u PRBCs for now
   - levofed pressors if needed with SBP goal > 75, MAP >55
   - blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   - continue cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment
   - broaden abx by adding vanco for potential line infection, although
   PICC line looks uninfected on exam
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   - CXR to look for pneumonia
   - KUB to look for obstruction or new obstruction
   - EKG and CEs to rule out cardiac cause
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: was initial presentation and thought to be due to
   peritonitis from microperforations and translocation.  Has had chronic
   abdominal pain this admission with intermittent large bowel
   obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.  Is passing gas
   and stooling.  Did have recent rectal tube for decompression, but fell
   out two nights ago.  Also has signs of chronic pancreatitis and an SMV
   as discussed below.  Pain could be from multiple etiologies.
   - serial abdominal exams
   - f/u final read of KUB, appears stable per HO read
   - abd pain seems at baseline
   - repeat CT abdomen to look for possible new microperf or abscess as
   source of infection, but just had CT two days ago that was stable and
   without obvious source
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
   - hold anticoagulation for thrombus as below
   - morphine PRN
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   - CXR to look for pneumonia
   - KUB to look for obstruction or new obstruction
   - EKG and CEs to rule out cardiac cause
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: was initial presentation and thought to be due to
   peritonitis from microperforations and translocation.  Has had chronic
   abdominal pain this admission with intermittent large bowel
   obstructions and chronically dilated loops of bowel.  Is passing gas
   and stooling.  Did have recent rectal tube for decompression, but fell
   out two nights ago.  Also has signs of chronic pancreatitis and an SMV
   as discussed below.  Pain could be from multiple etiologies.
   - serial abdominal exams
   - f/u final read of KUB, appears stable per HO read
   - abd pain seems at baseline
   - repeat CT abdomen to look for possible new microperf or abscess as
   source of infection, but just had CT two days ago that was stable and
   without obvious source
   - continue pancreatic enzyme repletion
   - hold anticoagulation for thrombus as below
   - morphine PRN
   - surgery following along
   .
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue cipro/flagyl as above
   - course of cipro/flagyl to complete 2 week course from ___ per floor
   team; consider ID consult if infectious workup positive
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: has been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - holding TPN for now for blood tx and boluses
   - restart TPN when stable
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues today, but will consider based
   on clinical course today; NPO; replete electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has a GI bleed, hypotension, abdominal pain, peritonitis, SMV thrombus, anemia, and is malnourished. The patient is receiving antibiotics, blood transfusions, and fluid resuscitation. The patient has a PICC line and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has a GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, acid-base imbalance, and electrolyte disturbances.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be due to the GI bleed, hypovolemia, or other underlying conditions such as sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency.
3. Peritonitis: The patient has peritonitis, which can lead to abscess formation, bowel obstruction, and sepsis.
4. SMV Thrombus: The patient has a chronic SMV thrombus, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, which can lead to decreased immune function, wound healing, and overall health.
7. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of peritonitis, GI bleed, and SMV thrombus.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis can lead to respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37 kg child who was admitted to the ICU with a history of abdominal distension, bilious emesis, and shock. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 73/52 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with bilious drainage from the nasogastric tube. The patient's extremities are contracted and frail, but with good skin integrity and warmth.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 7.2-6.1 K/uL
* Hct: 24.6-32.6%
* Platelet count: 197-155 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 300-106 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.9/24.7/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 16/<0.01/<0.01, ALT/AST: 7-31, Alk Phos/T Bili: 99/0.6, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 3.0 mg/dL, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition and treatment include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying illness and treatment with antibiotics
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrest due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's bilious emesis and nasogastric tube drainage
* Renal failure due to the patient's underlying illness and treatment with vasopressors
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and need for invasive procedures

The patient's care plan should focus on managing these potential complications, including close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, as well as optimizing treatment with antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support."

   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   -          continue Abx as above
   -          serial abdominal exams
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. He has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals and was on anticoagulation therapy. He developed a GI bleed, which is concerning for bleeding from his gastric varices or RP bleed. He also has peritonitis, which is being treated with antibiotics. He has a baseline anemia and is iron deficient. He is receiving TPN and is NPO due to the GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is a major concern, and he may require further treatment, including endoscopy or surgery, to control the bleeding.
2. Peritonitis: The patient's peritonitis may worsen if not treated properly, leading to further complications such as abscesses or sepsis.
3. Anticoagulation: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may need to be adjusted or held due to the GI bleed, which could increase the risk of thrombosis or embolism.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated properly, leading to further complications such as heart failure or poor wound healing.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if he is unable to receive adequate nutrition, leading to further complications such as decreased immune function or poor wound healing.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as brain damage or death.
7. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as decreased mobility or cognitive impairment.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in his GI tract, due to his peritonitis and anticoagulation therapy.
9. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for developing thrombosis due to his anticoagulation therapy and underlying medical conditions.
10. Embolism: The patient is at risk for developing embolism due to his anticoagulation therapy and underlying medical conditions."

   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP. Still on low-dose phenylephrine.

   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - continue  vanc, cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment pending
   culture data (at least 48 H negative)
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto

   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - coordinate care with GI and surgery
   - PICC for access, try for PIVs
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency.
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerated POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - NPO for now given GI bleeding
   - TPN ordered, but patient not receiving as no dedicated line
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with a gastrointestinal bleed, peritonitis, and a chronic SMV thrombus. He is currently receiving vasopressors for hypotension and has been transfused with blood products. His laboratory results show anemia, low albumin levels, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's peritonitis and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleed can lead to further hypovolemia, acidosis, and coagulopathy if not controlled.
4. Thrombus Progression: The patient's chronic SMV thrombus can progress and cause further complications, including pulmonary embolism and stroke.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's anemia and low albumin levels suggest nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to further complications if not addressed.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia suggest electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not corrected.
7. Infection: The patient's peritonitis and GI bleed increase his risk of developing further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
8. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's ongoing hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications if not addressed."

   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP. Still on low-dose phenylephrine.
   - try placing bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read

   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - TPN ordered, but patient not receiving as no dedicated line
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with a GI bleed, likely secondary to gastric varices, and is being treated with anticoagulation for a SMV clot. He also has peritonitis, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's anemia is likely due to iron deficiency and RP bleed. He is being treated with transfusions and iron supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, particularly if the anticoagulation is not held or if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Peritonitis: The patient may develop further complications from the peritonitis, such as abscesses or fistulas, if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the bleeding is not controlled or if the transfusions are not adequate.
4. SMV thrombus: The patient's SMV thrombus may progress or embolize if the anticoagulation is not continued.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen if the anticonvulsant medications are not continued or if the patient experiences further stress or trauma.
6. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may worsen if the patient experiences further neurological damage or if the patient's condition is not adequately managed.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised or if the patient is not receiving adequate treatment.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may develop nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition or if the patient's digestive system is not functioning properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's GI bleed, peritonitis, and SMV thrombus with anticoagulation and antibiotics.
3. Continue to transfuse the patient as needed to maintain a safe hemoglobin level.
4. Consider holding anticoagulation if the patient's bleeding is not controlled.
5. Continue to manage the patient's seizure disorder with anticonvulsant medications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cerebral palsy and consider further management if necessary.
7. Consider further management of the patient's anemia, including iron supplementation and transfusions.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider further management if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.  Baseline SBPs in the 80s,
   today s/p fluid resuscitation and pressure support with pressures
   closer to baseline with good UOP. Still on low-dose phenylephrine.
   - try placing bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - attempt to wean off pressors with goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >50cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - continue  vanc, cipro and flagyl for peritonitis treatment pending
   culture data (however had been on cipro [**Date range (1) 11720**], then restarted [**3-14**]);
   stop cipro/flagyl when negative cultures X48 hrs, maintain vanco until
   PICC line replaced
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - coordinate care with GI and surgery
   - PICC for access (no access for PIVs)
   - protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for briding of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - TPN ordered, but patient not receiving as no dedicated line
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: ICU for now
 could likely be called out if stable BP off of
   pressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is likely secondary to a GI bleed or RP bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for a SMV clot. He has been receiving fluid resuscitation and pressure support, and his blood pressure is closer to baseline with good urine output. The patient also has a gastric varices bleed, with blood in his NGT and coffee ground emesis, and is at risk for further bleeding. He has been prescribed protonix and is being managed by the GI and surgery teams.

The patient also has peritonitis, which was presumed to be the cause of his initial presentation, and is being treated with antibiotics. He has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals and was on lovenox and coumadin for anticoagulation. However, the anticoagulation has been held due to the GI bleed.

The patient has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and his ferritin studies suggest iron deficiency. He is being transfused for HCT <25 in the setting of bleed. He is also being managed for his seizure disorder, which is stable, and his cerebral palsy, which is stable and interactive with his family.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further bleeding from gastric varices or RP bleed, which could lead to hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Development of peritonitis, which could lead to worsening abdominal pain, fever, and organ dysfunction.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which could lead to bleeding complications.
4. Anemia, which could lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Seizure disorder, which could lead to seizure activity and potential brain damage.
6. Cerebral palsy, which could lead to worsening motor function and cognitive impairment.
7. Electrolyte imbalance, which could lead to muscle weakness, cramping, and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his blood pressure, urine output, and abdominal examination to detect any signs of bleeding or peritonitis. The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of infection, and his antibiotics should be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the patient's anemia should be managed with transfusions and iron supplementation, and his seizure disorder should be managed with anticonvulsants."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg, but is asymptomatic. The patient's PICC line was exchanged, and they were called to the floor. The patient has a Foley catheter in place, which was changed due to yeast in the urine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be a sign of hypovolemic shock or sepsis. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent complications.
2. Retroperitoneal Bleed (RP Bleed): The patient has a spontaneous RP bleed, which may be a sign of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has sepsis, which may progress to septic shock if not treated promptly. Antibiotics and supportive care are necessary to manage the infection.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a fluid balance deficit of -1,643 mL, which may lead to hypovolemic shock if not corrected. Fluid resuscitation and monitoring are necessary to prevent complications.
5. Respiratory Support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen, but may require more advanced respiratory support if oxygenation or ventilation becomes compromised.
6. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving nutrition, but may require further optimization to ensure adequate caloric intake and glycemic control.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT and PTT, which may indicate coagulopathy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and treatment with vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance.
2. Optimize fluid resuscitation and nutritional support to prevent hypovolemic shock and malnutrition.
3. Consider further investigation of the RP bleed, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, to determine the extent of the bleeding.
4. Continue antibiotics and supportive care for sepsis.
5. Monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation, and consider advanced respiratory support if necessary.
6. Consider treatment with vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Although patient had reported
   coffee ground emesis on the floor, most likely source of hypotension
   may have been RP bleed given CT findings.  Now off pressors since
   yesterday afternoon, and leg pressures have been stable with SBPs in
   the 70s and 80s.
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now, but may consider lovenox again in the
   next 24-48 hours
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: CALLED OUT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: PICC exchanged.  Patient remains hypotensive but
   asymptomatic, leg blood pressures measured, and slightly higher with
   SBP low 80s.  Foley changed out given yeast in URINE.  Patient called
   out to floor.

   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was admitted with coffee ground emesis and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s. The cause is likely secondary to GI bleed or retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot.
* GI bleed: The patient has a known history of gastric varices and is experiencing blood in his nasogastric tube and coffee ground emesis, which is concerning for GI bleed.
* Peritonitis: Although no positive cultures, the patient was presumed to have peritonitis on admission and is currently being treated with antibiotics.
* SMV thrombus: The patient has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals and was on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
* Anemia: The patient has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies suggest iron deficiency.
* Nutrition: The patient has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been tolerating oral feeds for a few days on the floor prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
* Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder is stable, and he is not reporting any recent seizures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* GI bleed: Hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, and perforation of the gut.
* Peritonitis: Sepsis, organ dysfunction, and abscess formation.
* SMV thrombus: Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and stroke.
* Anemia: Fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
* Nutrition: Malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance.
* Seizure disorder: Seizure recurrence, status epilepticus, and brain damage.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing IV fluids and transfusions as needed.
* Holding anticoagulation therapy for now and considering lovenox again in the next 24-48 hours.
* Continuing antibiotics for presumed peritonitis.
* Starting tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement and holding TPN for now.
* Continuing phenobarbitol and phenytoin for seizure disorder.
* Changing the foley catheter due to yeast in the urine.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further interventions will be based on the results of imaging studies, laboratory tests, and clinical evaluations."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Although patient had reported
   coffee ground emesis on the floor, most likely source of hypotension
   may have been RP bleed given CT findings.  Now off pressors since
   yesterday afternoon, and leg pressures have been stable with SBPs in
   the 70s and 80s.
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now, but may consider lovenox again in the
   next 24-48 hours
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to GI bleed or RP bleed in the
   setting of anticoagulation for SMV clot. Although patient had reported
   coffee ground emesis on the floor, most likely source of hypotension
   may have been RP bleed given CT findings.  Now off pressors since
   yesterday afternoon, and leg pressures have been stable with SBPs in
   the 70s and 80s.
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV BID
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now, but may consider lovenox again in the
   next 24-48 hours
   ..
   # Peritonitis: although no positive cultures, was presumed to have
   peritonitis on admission and cause of initial presentation.
   - continue Abx as above
   - serial abdominal exams, currently improving
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient's condition has been stable, with no signs of active bleeding or organ dysfunction. He has been treated with antibiotics, and his blood pressure has been stabilized with the use of vasopressors. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of anemia, and he has been transfused with blood products. He has also been treated with anticoagulation therapy for a chronic superior mesenteric vein thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleeding, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's known gastric varices and coffee ground emesis suggest a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
3. Retroperitoneal bleeding: The patient's retroperitoneal bleeding could lead to hypotension, shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to weakness, fatigue, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to seizures and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Cerebral palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to increased risk of seizures, spasticity, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding with antibiotics and transfusions as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's retroperitoneal bleeding with transfusions and surgical intervention as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions and iron supplementation as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's malnutrition with tube feeds and nutritional supplementation as needed.
7. Continue to manage the patient's seizure disorder with anticonvulsant therapy and seizure prophylaxis as needed.
8. Continue to manage the patient's cerebral palsy with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   35 y/o M with hx of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic
   pancreatitis and known gastric varices who is transferred with coffee
   ground emesis and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to RP bleed in the setting of
   anticoagulation for SMV clot. Off pressors since [**3-15**] am , no
   transfusions since [**3-13**].
   - Continue bp cuff on thighs for more accurate read
   - goal MAP > 55, SBP > 75
   - continue with IVF, bolus to UOP >30cc/hr
   - transfuse for HCT <25
   - Cipro flagyl D/cd yesterday given that cx data was negative x 48
   hours. Given history of instrumentation, will continue Vanco until
   cultures finalize
   - would be missing VRE coverage and if clinically worsening, consider
   broadening by adding dapto
   .
   # GI bleed: Patient with know gastric varices with blood in NGT and
   coffee ground emesis concerning for GI bleed while on Coumadin with
   imaging concerning for GI and / or RP bleed. Patient with improving HCT
   s/p transfusion without evidence of active bleeding. Now Hct and HD
   stable with Tfts running.
   - NPO, NGT in place draining bilious fluid to suction
   - Change IV protonix to lansoprazole per NGT
   - trend HCT and transfuse for HCT <25
   - hold anticoagulation for now
   - Revisit anticoagulation issue at a later time (perhaps d/w liver)
   .
   # SMV Thrombus: has a chronic SMV thrombus with good collaterals.  Was
   on lovenox for bridging of subtherapeutic INR and on coumadin.
   Reimaging several days ago showed stable clot without progression.
   Vascular surgery was following along and plan was for 6 months of
   anticoagulation and reevaluation at that time.
   - hold lovenox and coumadin in setting of GI bleed
   - consider risks/benefits of long term anticoagulation and consider
   holding based on EGD findings and extent of bleed
   .
   # Anemia: has new baseline anemia around 30 from 35, and fe studies
   suggest iron deficiency. Also with RP bleed (see above)
   - continue fe supplementation after GI workup complete
   - transfuse for hct <25 in setting of bleed
   .
   # Nutrition: Had been receiving TPN and GI had been consulted for a PEG
   tube for long term feeding, although wanted to wait for abx course to
   be completed and repeat para if fluid was present to confirm resolution
   of possible peritonitis.  Did tolerate POs for a few days on the floor
   prior to his most recent large bowel obstruction.
   - start tube feeds with pancreatic enzyme replacement (tube currently
   in duodenum)
   - Hold TPN for now as patient appears to be tolerating TFs well
   - continue to follow albumin levels; remains hypoalbuminemic
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: is stable, no reports of recent seizures.
   - continue phenobarbitol and phenytoin
   .
   # Yeast in urine
   - Change foley
   .
   # Cerebral Palsy: stable, is interactive with family although
   non-verbal.  Continue to monitor mental status.
   .
   # FEN: on TPN, holding for access issues, starting TFs; replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   # Access: PICC, attempt at PIV
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], holding anticoagulation, pneumoboots
   # Communication: with family, mom in particular
   # Code: full, confirmed with family
   # Dispo: CALLED OUT

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, chronic pancreatitis, and known gastric varices who was transferred to the ICU with coffee ground emesis and hypotension. The patient remains hypotensive but asymptomatic with a blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg. The patient's PICC line was exchanged, and the Foley catheter was changed due to yeast in the urine. The patient's abdominal discomfort has persisted, and the NGT is draining bilious fluid. The patient's lab results show anemia, and the patient is being transfused for HCT <25.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to the retroperitoneal bleed and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. GI Bleed: The patient's known gastric varices and coffee ground emesis suggest a high risk of GI bleed, which may be exacerbated by anticoagulation and may require urgent endoscopy.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which may be complicated by the patient's underlying conditions.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be exacerbated by the GI bleed and may require further transfusions.
5. Nutrition: The patient's malnutrition may be complicated by the GI bleed and may require adjustment of the nutrition plan.
6. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying conditions and may require adjustment of the anticonvulsant medication.
7. Cerebral Palsy: The patient's cerebral palsy may be complicated by the patient's underlying conditions and may require adjustment of the patient's care plan.
8. Yeast in Urine: The patient's yeast in the urine may be a sign of a urinary tract infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
9. Anticoagulation: The patient's anticoagulation may be complicated by the GI bleed and may require adjustment of the anticoagulation plan.
10. Chronic Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may be complicated by the GI bleed and may require adjustment of the patient's care plan.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension, GI bleed, and sepsis require urgent management. The patient's anemia and malnutrition require further transfusions and adjustment of the nutrition plan. The patient's seizure disorder and cerebral palsy require adjustment of the anticonvulsant medication and care plan. The patient's yeast in the urine requires antibiotic treatment. The patient's anticoagulation requires adjustment in light of the GI bleed. The patient's chronic pancreatitis requires adjustment of the patient's care plan."
