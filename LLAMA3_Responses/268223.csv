   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.4, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG consistantly elevated
   -discontinue Glargine + HISS.
   -started insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at new renal dosages
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso.  Will d/c
   abx, as may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute on chronic liver disease, and portal hypertension. He has a history of NASH, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension, and has undergone a TIPS procedure. He has also been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation, acute kidney injury, and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent bronchoscopy showing minimal inflammatory response.
* Cardiovascular: Mitral regurgitation, with a recent echo showing an EF >55% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
* Hepatic: Cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and recent TIPS procedure complicated by slight injury to the left portal vein.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury, with a recent creatinine of 3.1.
* Infectious: Fever, with a recent blood culture and urine culture pending. He has also had a recent CT scan showing a left lobar pneumonia and right-sided pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of further respiratory failure due to his underlying chronic liver disease and portal hypertension.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and portal hypertension put him at risk of further cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Hepatic complications: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension put him at risk of further hepatic complications, including liver failure and encephalopathy.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury puts him at risk of further renal complications, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's fever and recent blood culture and urine culture pending put him at risk of further infectious complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's portal hypertension and recent TIPS procedure put him at risk of further gastrointestinal complications, including variceal bleeding and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension put him at risk of further neurological complications, including encephalopathy and seizures.

Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, and consider further cardiac evaluation and management as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's liver disease and portal hypertension, and consider further liver transplant evaluation and management as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, and consider further renal evaluation and management as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infectious status, and consider further antibiotic therapy and management as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely, and consider further gastrointestinal evaluation and management as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider further neurological evaluation and management as needed.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and optimize his care."

   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD. She was admitted with respiratory failure, acute lobar pneumonia, and right-sided pleural effusion. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated but was extubated on [**9-13**]. She has a history of mitral regurgitation and was recently s/p TIPS procedure, which complicated by slight injury to the left portal vein. She has ongoing fever, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to chronic liver disease, mitral regurgitation, and possible pulmonary embolism or infarct.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fever, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure, which may be due to a bacterial or fungal infection.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis, which may be contributing to her ongoing respiratory failure and fever.
4. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and ESLD, which may be contributing to her ongoing respiratory failure and fever.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic liver disease, bleeding, or other causes.
6. Diabetes: The patient has type 2 diabetes, which may be contributing to her ongoing respiratory failure and fever.
7. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to contrast dye, sepsis, or other causes.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has mitral regurgitation and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to her chronic liver disease and ongoing respiratory failure.
10. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which may be contributing to her ongoing respiratory failure and fever.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation and oxygenation as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and antifungals as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's portal vein thrombosis and consider thrombolytic therapy if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's liver failure with medications and fluids as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes with insulin and oral medications as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's renal failure and consider dialysis if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider medications or interventions as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Lung Injury, Mitral Regurgitation, Cirrhosis of the Liver, Anemia, Diabetes Mellitus (Type II), and Acute Renal Failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart Rate: 83 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood Pressure: 126/42 mmHg (64/58 mmHg)
* Respiratory Rate: 17 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen Saturation: 99%
* Heart Rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 453-702 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 42 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 170 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 17.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet Count (Plt): 116 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 3.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 169 mg/dL
* Other lab results include:

   - PT / PTT / INR: 19.6/33.2/1.8
   - ALT / AST: 19/25
   - Alk Phos / T Bili: 104/1.8
   - Amylase / Lipase: 29/40
   - Differential-Neuts: 83.5%
   - Band: 0.0%
   - Lymph: 10.0%
   - Mono: 6.2%
   - Eos: 0.1%
   - Lactic Acid: 1.7 mmol/L
   - Albumin: 4.4 g/dL
   - LDH: 181 IU/L
   - Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL
   - Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
   - PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and Acute Lung Injury can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection and immunosuppression can increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's Acute Renal Failure can worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Liver failure: The patient's Cirrhosis of the Liver can lead to liver failure, which can cause coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's Mitral Regurgitation can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppression and presence of invasive devices can increase the risk of developing infections, which can be life-threatening.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, which can worsen their condition.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's Diabetes Mellitus (Type II) can lead to hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of developing complications such as ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and manage their treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve their outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - Vent settings on ARDSnet protocol, pt oxygenating well
   - titrating down FiO2 and PEEP as tolerating
   - increased P02 after increased hydral dosage, consistant with CHF
   contributing to hypoxia, titrated hdryal up to 15 q8h. However d/ced
   hydralazine while getting CVVHD since BP dropping.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc while on CVVHD
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continues to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx yesterday
   - minimal sedation to avoid hypotension
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   - CVVHD has been intermittent [**3-11**] line issues, yesterday pulled LIJ and
   placed femoral, now running well. Goal i/o -2L
   - 5of peep, will get RSBI 87 this am, doing well on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] attempt
   extubation later today. However concerned given pt's high minute
   ventalation.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to maximize
   diuresis
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol prophylaxis held to increase BP while on CVVHD
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.4, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG consistantly elevated
   -discontinue Glargine + HISS.
   -started insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   -HRS meds stoped
   - Poor UO with lasix and diuril
   - on CVVHD diuresis as tolerated by BP, goal -2L today
   -monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of fxn
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro at new renal dosages
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso.  Will d/c

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD. She was admitted with respiratory failure, acute lobar PNA, and R-sided pleural effusion. She has a recent history of UGIB and banding of grade II varices. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a high minute ventilation, which is a concern for extubation.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including cirrhosis of the liver, mitral regurgitation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, type II, and renal failure. She has a recent history of TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She has also had a recent abdominal CT scan that showed no evidence of obstruction.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have been attributed to PNA/pleural effusion-related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis. She has a new cough since the TIPS procedure and has been experiencing RUQ pain. She has been treated with antibiotics, but the source of the continued fevers is unclear.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 83 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 126/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 13 mmHg, total fluid balance -1,613 mL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's high minute ventilation and respiratory rate may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures may indicate a risk of sepsis.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's recent history of TIPS procedure and RUQ pain may indicate a risk of portal vein thrombosis.
4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and ESLD may increase the risk of liver failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and high creatinine levels may indicate a risk of worsening renal function.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and high blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's fevers and consider additional diagnostic testing to determine the source of the fevers.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider additional testing to determine the extent of liver damage.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider additional testing to determine the extent of renal damage.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's mitral regurgitation and high blood pressure.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD. She was admitted with respiratory failure and was intubated. She was extubated on [**9-13**] and is currently on 3L NC oxygen. She has a history of CHF, mitral regurgitation, and portal vein thrombosis. She is also diagnosed with type II diabetes, anemia, and acute renal failure. She has been experiencing fever, cough, and RUQ pain since the TIPS procedure. Her current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 83 bpm
* Blood pressure: 126/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of CHF and mitral regurgitation, which may be contributing to her hypoxia. She has also developed lobar pneumonia and a small right pleural effusion.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has worsened since the TIPS procedure, and she is currently anuric. The etiology of her acute renal failure is unclear, but it may be related to contrast dye, sepsis, or hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis, which may be contributing to her RUQ pain and fever.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is 9.1 g/dL, which is below the normal range. She is being transfused with PRBCs as needed.
5. Diabetes: The patient has type II diabetes, which is being managed with insulin and other medications.
6. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fever since the TIPS procedure, which may be related to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed lobar pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated appropriately.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a small right pleural effusion, which may worsen if not treated appropriately.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis, which may worsen if not treated appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed appropriately.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen if not managed appropriately.
6. Fever: The patient's fever may worsen if not managed appropriately.

Plan:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with dialysis and medication as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's portal vein thrombosis with anticoagulation therapy and monitoring as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions and medication as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes with insulin and other medications as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's fever with antibiotics and other medications as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure that she is not developing any new medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's chief complaint is alertness with some anxiety. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, insulin infusion, and multiple medications, including midazolam, hydralazine, and pantoprazole. The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight/obese, with poor dentition and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 124/43 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a serum creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26.7 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and the patient remains intubated. The patient's response to treatment has been faster than expected, but the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is still unclear.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, with a serum creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL and a BUN of 26.7 mg/dL. The patient is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage fluid overload.
3. Liver disease: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which may be contributing to the patient's respiratory failure and renal impairment.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to the patient's respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may be contributing to the patient's respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever and lack of growth on sputum cultures suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with CVVH and consider further interventions, such as dialysis, if necessary.
3. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's liver disease, anemia, and diabetes mellitus.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's possible infection.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures, as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) lobar pneumonia, and right pleural effusion. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has portal vein thrombosis. The patient has been intubated and extubated, and has been experiencing fevers, cough, and abdominal discomfort. She has also been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation, anemia, type II diabetes, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying lung disease, pleural effusion, and possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, cough, and abdominal discomfort may indicate an underlying septic process, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis may lead to liver failure, which could worsen her respiratory and renal function.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen due to her underlying kidney disease, sepsis, and possible contrast-induced nephropathy.
5. Bleeding: The patient's portal vein thrombosis and liver disease may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and lung disease may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and possible pulmonary embolism may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as ascites, bleeding, or obstruction.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's liver disease and sepsis may lead to neurological complications, such as encephalopathy or seizures.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's underlying medical conditions, as well as the need for early recognition and treatment of any new complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 9.1, stable, consider transfusion if clinical situation
   worsen or hgb below 7.0
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation yesterday, Insulin gtt
   turned down from [**1-22**] to 5mg/hr.
   -restart Glargine + HISS.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -If tolerate HD tomorrow will transfer to floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), lobar PNA, and R pleural effusion. She has undergone a TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She has also been diagnosed with mitral regurgitation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, type II, and acute renal failure.

Recent events include:

* Wrist pain increased, treated with prn oxycodone
* Fever spikes, initially attributed to PNA/pleural effusion, but now unclear
* Cough developed since TIPS procedure
* RUQ pain stable and not changing
* Anemia trended downward on admission, but stabilized with transfusion
* Diabetes mellitus under control, with insulin gtt turned down

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: continued hypoxia despite increasing O2, possible PE or other intraparenchymal lung shunting
* Cardiac failure: CHF contributing to hypoxia, mitral regurgitation may be underestimated
* Infection: ongoing fever spikes, possible PNA/pleural effusion or PE, or other source
* Liver failure: NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD, possible liver transplant consideration
* Renal failure: acute renal failure, possible ATN, CIN, or HRS, with anuric state
* Bleeding: possible GI bleed due to L portal vein thrombosis, or other complications
* Anemia: ongoing anemia, possible transfusion requirements
* Diabetes mellitus: controlled, but possible need for insulin adjustment
* Anxiety: patient complains of anxiety, with history of abusing benzos, and started on Ativan prn

Plan:

* Continue to monitor and manage respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and infection
* Consider liver transplant consideration
* Continue renal replacement therapy, with plan for HD tomorrow and possible tunneling line on Monday
* Monitor for UO and renal function
* Continue to manage anemia and diabetes mellitus
* Monitor for anxiety and adjust treatment as needed"

   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia

   significant mitral regurgitation there has not been a dramatic change
   in her cardiac function to explain why she developed pulmonary edema.
   Temporally the connection to her TIPS raises the possibility that she

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.

   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.

   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement

   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided

s assessment and plan as above.  She has improved dramatically
   over the last several days without clear explanation.  Although she has
   significant mitral regurgitation there has not been a dramatic change
   in her cardiac function to explain why she developed pulmonary edema.
   Temporally the connection to her TIPS raises the possibility that she
   had hemodynamic changes post procedure that may have contributed to
   cardiac decomp. Nevertheless, she is now breathing comfortably with
   clear chest and her R pleural effusion has even resolved.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Condition:**

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD. She has acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and mitral regurgitation. She was recently intubated and extubated, and is currently on oxygen therapy. She has also undergone a TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein.

**Lab Results:**

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 134 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Liver function tests (LFTs): elevated
* Coagulation studies: normal
* Blood cultures: negative

**Medical Complications:**

The patient is at risk for the following medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: due to her underlying lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): due to her underlying kidney disease and the use of contrast dye during the TIPS procedure
* Mitral regurgitation: due to her underlying cardiac disease
* Portal vein thrombosis: due to the TIPS procedure
* Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): due to her underlying liver disease
* Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN): due to the use of contrast dye during the TIPS procedure
* Infection: due to her underlying lung disease and the presence of pleural effusion
* Bleeding: due to her underlying liver disease and the use of anticoagulation therapy
* Anemia: due to her underlying kidney disease and the use of anticoagulation therapy
* Hyperglycemia: due to her underlying diabetes and the use of insulin therapy
* Hypotension: due to her underlying cardiac disease and the use of antihypertensive therapy

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continued oxygen therapy to support her respiratory status
* Monitoring of her blood pressure and electrolyte levels to prevent hypotension and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitoring of her kidney function to prevent AKI and HRS
* Monitoring of her liver function to prevent bleeding and coagulopathy
* Monitoring of her infection status to prevent sepsis and organ failure
* Management of her mitral regurgitation with diuretics and vasodilators
* Management of her portal vein thrombosis with anticoagulation therapy
* Management of her anemia with transfusions and iron therapy
* Management of her hyperglycemia with insulin therapy and dietary changes
* Management of her hypotension with vasopressors and fluids

**ICU Care:**

The patient is currently receiving ICU care, which includes:

* Continuous monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results
* Intravenous fluids and medications to support her respiratory and cardiac status
* Mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory status
* Dialysis to support her kidney function
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent bleeding and coagulopathy
* Antibiotics to prevent infection
* Pain management with opioids and non-opioids
* Sedation and analgesia to manage her anxiety and pain

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of

   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute, and mitral regurgitation. She has undergone a TIPS procedure, which was complicated by a slight injury to the left portal vein. She has also been diagnosed with anemia, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute renal failure.

The patient's 24-hour events include an increase in wrist pain, which was managed with oxycodone, and a fever spike. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/33 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a warm and tender abdomen, with a reducible umbilical hernia. Her lungs are clear, and her neurologic examination is normal. Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 17.7, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and her recent TIPS procedure.
2. Mitral regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation may be contributing to her heart failure and volume overload.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's portal vein thrombosis may be causing her abdominal discomfort and fever.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's acute renal failure may be related to her underlying liver disease and portal vein thrombosis.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her underlying chronic kidney disease and her recent blood transfusions.
7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II may be contributing to her hyperglycemia and potential complications.
8. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be related to her underlying chronic kidney disease and her recent TIPS procedure.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue to monitor her respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage her mitral regurgitation with diuretics and vasodilators.
3. Continue to monitor her portal vein thrombosis and consider anticoagulation therapy.
4. Continue to manage her acute renal failure with dialysis and medications.
5. Continue to monitor her infection and adjust her antibiotics as needed.
6. Continue to monitor her anemia and adjust her transfusions as needed.
7. Continue to manage her diabetes mellitus type II with insulin and other medications.
8. Continue to monitor her overall condition and adjust her care plan as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
   -started ativan 1mg q6h prn. Will be reluctant to increase dose much
   with abuse h/o

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of NASH cirrhosis, ESLD, and ESRD, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute mitral regurgitation, and portal vein thrombosis. She has undergone TIPS procedure, which was complicated by slight injury to the left portal vein. She has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on 3L NC oxygen. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and anemia.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, which have been attributed to PNA/pleural effusion-related or PE from portal vein thrombosis. She has also been experiencing abdominal discomfort, likely related to pleural effusion irritation of the abdomen. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she has been receiving ursodiol, allopurinol, and rifaximin.

The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, with a recent CXR showing improvement in PVC and effusion over the past two days. She has been receiving hydralazine, which has been held due to low MAP. She has also been receiving nadolol and norvasc, which were discontinued.

The patient has been experiencing anemia, with a recent HCT of 8.4. She has been receiving PRBCs and has been transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**]. She has also been experiencing diabetes, with a recent BG of 134.

The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure, with a recent creatinine of 3.1. The etiology of ARF is felt to be contrast dye-related, with a pre-renal range of FeNa. The patient has been receiving CVVHD, which was stopped yesterday, and is scheduled for HD tomorrow.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and her recent CXR shows improvement in PVC and effusion over the past two days. However, she is still on 3L NC oxygen and may require further treatment for respiratory failure.
2. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis, which may be causing her abdominal discomfort and fevers.
3. Liver failure: The patient has a history of liver disease, and her liver function tests are abnormal. She may be at risk for liver failure.
4. Kidney failure: The patient has a history of kidney disease, and her recent creatinine of 3.1 suggests that she may be experiencing kidney failure.
5. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be attributed to PNA/pleural effusion-related or PE from portal vein thrombosis. She may be at risk for infection.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her recent BP of 109/33 suggests that she may be experiencing hypertension.
7. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and her recent HCT of 8.4 suggests that she may be experiencing anemia.
8. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes, and her recent BG of 134 suggests that she may be experiencing diabetes.
9. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and her recent creatinine of 3.1 suggests that she may be experiencing acute renal failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, portal vein thrombosis, liver failure, kidney failure, infection, hypertension, anemia, diabetes, and acute renal failure."

   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo F with history of NASH cirrhosis and ESLD, now with ESRD.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])L lobar PNA and R pleural
   effusion on Chest CT from 7.25.  [**9-4**] echo showed EF >55%, Mild to
   moderate ([**2-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
   shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] therefore chf as cause of volume overload/hypoxia is
   likely. PE/pulmonary infarct also possible despite LENIs negative given
   recent TIPS placement and possible L portal vein thrombosis. Of note
   the pt was not tachycardic but has also been on nadalol. Pt hypoxia
   remains resistant to increasing O2, which is more consistant with PE or
   other intraparenchymal lung shunting.  Pt intubated [**9-5**].
   - extubated [**9-13**].  Temporarily desat to 85% after extubation, however,
   pt rapidly requiring less oxygen, now only on 3L NC
   - believe CHF contributing to hypoxia, had restarted hydralazine 5mg
   q8h after extubation since also Hypertensive at that time. However, am
   dose held [**3-11**] low MAP, d/ced for now in anticipation of low BP with HD.
   - D/c nadolol and norvasc
   -Consulted IP [**9-11**] for thoracentesis of BL plueral effusions, however,
   no tapable effusion noted on US.
   - CT Torso [**9-11**] unchanged compared to prior
   - Tele monitoring
   - continued to spike fevers on prolonged Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro (start date
   7.26), d/c these abx [**9-13**]
   - Bronchoscopy [**9-12**], unimpressive for infection, GS just 1+ polys.  f/u
   results
   -CXR greatly improved PVC and effusion over last 2 days.
 MITRAL REGURGITATION (MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY)
   Pt has MR, which might be underestimated per the echo on [**9-4**].
   - good response to increased Hydralazine, however holding to avoid
   hypotension
 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, OTHER - [**3-11**] NASH, stage IV disease by biopsy.
   Recently s/p UGIB and banding of grade II varices
   - continue ursodiol, allopurinol, rifaximin,
   - nadolol no longer necessary with successful TIPS
   Abdominal discomfort: Likely related to pleural effusion irritation of
   abodomen. Pt with ? L Portal vein thrombosis on recent RUQ U/S.  TIPS
   procedure complicated by slight injury to L portal vein. Abdomen
   tympanic but with no ascites on imaging or bedside. Recent abdominal CT
   shows no evidence of obstruction.
   - GI against proflaxtic anticoagulation of L portal vein thrombosis
   given high risk bleed
   - trend LFTs
   - serial abdominal exams
   - Lactulose decreased to 30 on [**9-7**] since increased diarrhea, likely
   getting more since intubated cause was not reaching goal of 45mg [**3-11**]
   nausea.
   -repeat abd US [**9-8**] No flow is detected in the left
   portal vein or the anterior right portal vein on this exam, but this
   may be due to technical factors.
   - lack of portal vein flow does not elimate pt as canidate for liver
   transplant, liver will discuss possibity of future transplant as team
   -f/u hep panel and PPD (placed [**9-14**]) for beginning of transplant work
   up.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Pt's admit hct above baseline, but trended downward on admission.
   Transfused with PRBCs on [**8-27**].  Follow daily hct.
   - HBG now 8.4, stable, type and screen sent this am for possible
   transfusion of pRBC with HD
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   BG more controlled, stoped TF with extubation
   -restarted Glargine + HISS and sugars well controlled.
   -d/c insulin gtt
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.7; Creatinine was initially improving this admission, with a
   nadir of 1.9, then significantly worsenined after TIPS procedure, now
   downtrending to 3.1.  Etiology of ARF felt be be contrast dye related
   as per renal. ARFrelated to sepsis/infection or Hepatorenal syndrome
   being less likely. HRS is less likely given that the patient likely has
   an active infectious process and that UNa > 10.  FeNa is also in the
   pre-renal range. However since pt was improving on HRS meds GI wanted
   to continue. No evidence of hydronephrosis on CT abdomen.
   -Renal believes unlikely HRS, think ATN [**3-11**] CIN
   - CVVHD stoped yesterday after -1.5 L neg for day.
   -Plan for HD tomorrow and if tolearates HD for tunneling line Monday
   -Will give Vit K on Sunday to minimize FFP needed for line placement
   -anuric at this time monitor for UO, renal 50/50 changes of return of
   fxn
   -          For HD today, possibly get unit prbc.
   -          Will keep in Central line until after HD completed in case
   hypotension develops.  Should d/c IJ once leave floor.
   Fever - PNA/pleural effusion related vs PE from portal vein thrombosis.
   New cough since TIPS procedure. CXR/CT confirm L lobar PNA and R sided
   pleural effusion.
   RUQ pain s/p TIPS, but stable and not changing. No abdominal ascites on
   previous imaging confirmed by bedside echo exam therefore SBP unlikely.
   - spiked again [**9-12**], pan cultured
   - pleural tap not possible, No fluid to tap as per IP
   - f/u Blood cult, urine, sputum
   - stool [**8-24**] neg, UCx [**9-2**] GNR 5000/ml and enterococcus 1000/ml
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro  d/ced on [**9-13**]
   - [**9-6**] C diff negative x 3, stoped precautions
   - source of continued fevers unclear, even after CT torso. d/c abx, as
   may be drug fever
   -f/u Bronch results, however did not look to be infectious.
   -f/u fungal cults
   Anxiety: pt complains of anxiety. However h/o abusing benzos in past
