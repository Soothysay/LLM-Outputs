   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is empyema and bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with GNR.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining
   good urine output.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue tobramycin, linezolid, meropenem
   - continue caspofungin and acyclovir prophylaxis, will consider sending
   Bglucan and galactomannan
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF and pressors to MAP > 65, try to wean pressors off
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Her rapid ventricular rate is secondary to
   stress due to infection.  She appears to be intravascularly volume
   down.  She also has pain which is contributing to pain.  Currently
   - will try to wean her off of esmolol
   - IVF given septic shock
   - complete amio IV load with gtt
   - appreciate cardiology recs
   - ? cardioversion tomorrow, may convert back given acute stress
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, ? two with air
   leak.
   - appreciate thoracics recs
   - antibiotics as above
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Respiratory alkolisis: Most likely due to increased RR.  Will
   decrease RR and recheck ABG.  Also readjusted the tube positioning as
   it is too high.
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease.  Tbili
   and dbili climbing up secondary to this.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - appreciated GI recs regarding elevated bili
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   - Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # FEN: Trophic tube feeds started today.  ? Nutrition consult for TPN.
   Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure due to empyema and bacteremia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and corticosteroids. Her current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 35.3°C, HR 123 bpm, BP 110/80 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Laboratory results: WBC 5.5 x 10^9/L, Hct 24.3%, Plt 34 x 10^9/L, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, TCO2 25 mmHg, Glucose 149 mg/dL
* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 35%
* Cardiovascular support: Vasopressors and corticosteroids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg
* Gastrointestinal support: Trophic tube feeds and electrolyte repletion as needed
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Arterial line and multi-lumen central venous catheter

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, or heart failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to respiratory arrest or require more aggressive respiratory support, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
4. Graft-versus-host disease: The patient's GVHD may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction, including liver failure, kidney failure, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.
6. Empyema: The patient's empyema may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise or sepsis.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction or complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction or complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy and adjust as necessary based on culture results and clinical response.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust vasopressor therapy as necessary to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg.
3. Continue respiratory support and adjust as necessary based on the patient's clinical response.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function closely and adjust nutrition therapy as necessary to prevent malnutrition.
5. Continue GVHD prophylaxis and adjust as necessary based on the patient's clinical response.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and transfuse as necessary to maintain a platelet count above 60,000 x 10^9/L.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy based on her thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte balance closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
9. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a nutrition plan that meets the patient's needs.
10. Consider consulting with a palliative care team to address the patient's pain, symptom management, and end-of-life care needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. She has a history of empyema, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) with GNR (Gram-negative rod). She is being treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and corticosteroids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her current infections, including empyema, bacteremia, and UTI. This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular rate is secondary to stress due to infection, and she is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and her condition could worsen if her respiratory status is not closely monitored and managed.
4. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD could lead to further complications, such as skin lesions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could lead to bleeding complications, especially if she undergoes invasive procedures or experiences trauma.
6. Nutritional Deficits: The patient's altered nutrition could lead to malnutrition, which could exacerbate her underlying conditions and increase her risk of complications.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen if not closely monitored and managed, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
8. Pain Control: The patient's acute and chronic pain could worsen if not adequately managed, leading to decreased mobility, increased risk of complications, and decreased quality of life.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results, as well as manage her infections, GVHD, and nutritional deficits."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hematothorax, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute cancer, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension, and pain control. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation and has undergone cardioversion/defibrillation with 200 joules.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/80 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and ventilator, and is receiving oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, and the patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 32 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 58 IU/L.

The patient's medical history includes a history of cancer, and the patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and pain medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hematothorax-related complications, including bleeding, infection, and respiratory compromise.
4. Cancer-related complications, including metastasis, bleeding, and organ dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.
6. Acute kidney injury-related complications, including fluid overload, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Liver dysfunction-related complications, including coagulopathy, bleeding, and encephalopathy.
8. Pain-related complications, including opioid tolerance, hyperalgesia, and respiratory depression.

The patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory function, as well as management of pain, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including empyema, respiratory failure, sepsis, and unstable atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the MICU service and has had a significant eventful night with AFib, hypotension, and urgent cardioversion. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show signs of sepsis, including elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and inflammatory markers. She has also developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy. Her skin integrity is compromised, and she has developed blistering, which is worrisome. She is also malnourished and has a history of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and there is a risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation or respiratory arrest.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's unstable atrial fibrillation is a concern, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest or further arrhythmias.
4. Skin Complications: The patient's blistering skin lesions are worrisome and may lead to further skin breakdown and infection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's severe malnutrition is a concern, and there is a risk of further malabsorption and malnutrition.
6. GVHD: The patient's history of GVHD is a concern, and there is a risk of further complications, including liver failure.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding or thrombotic complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, and there is a risk of further anemia and blood transfusion requirements.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding or thrombotic complications.
10. Infection: The patient's sepsis and skin lesions increase her risk of further infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue present antibiotics and discuss tobra dosing with ID.
2. Pursue echo to exclude endocarditis.
3. Continue amiodarone and discuss with cardiology.
4. Leave intubated today given recent marked rhythm instability.
5. Consult dermatology for blistering skin lesions.
6. Tube feeds today and watch for malabsorption given GVHD.
7. Continue present immunosuppression.
8. Continue stress-dose steroids for now.
9. Keep platelet count > 60 given hemothorax, per BMT.
10. Monitor patient's laboratory results and adjust treatment accordingly.
11. Consider transferring patient to a higher level of care, such as a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU), for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock, empyema, and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive care measures.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamic instability with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg
* Respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 351 mmHg and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%
* Septic shock with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg and a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2
* Impaired skin integrity with multiple blood cultures positive for Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae
* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 51 x 10^9/L
* Elevated liver enzymes with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 60 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 38 IU/L
* Impaired renal function with a creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL
* Hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 190 mg/dL
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 151/86 mmHg
* Pain control with an intravenous (IV) opioid analgesic

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and hepatic dysfunction
* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) progression, including liver and skin involvement
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Hypotension and cardiovascular instability
* Hyperglycemia and glucose control issues
* Impaired nutrition and hydration
* Skin lesions and potential infections
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability and potential arrhythmias

Recommendations:

* Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed
* Monitor and manage sepsis-related organ dysfunction closely
* Consider adjusting vasopressor therapy to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg
* Monitor and manage thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as needed
* Consider adjusting anticoagulation therapy to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE)
* Monitor and manage hyperglycemia with insulin therapy as needed
* Provide adequate nutrition and hydration support
* Monitor and manage skin lesions and potential infections closely
* Consider adjusting respiratory support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Monitor and manage cardiovascular instability closely, including arrhythmias and hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant, followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and subsequent severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 74 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 151/86 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg, total intravenous fluids (IVF) 4,704 mL

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.6-17.0 K/μL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.3-11.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 64-145 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24-28 mg/dL
* Sodium (Na): 140-146 mmol/L
* Potassium (K): 3.0-4.0 mmol/L
* Chloride (Cl): 100-110 mmol/L
* Glucose: 114-190 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 215 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Lopressor (metoprolol) for atrial fibrillation
* Midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl for sedation and analgesia
* Linezolid and tobramycin for sepsis
* Meropenem for sepsis
* Caspofungin for fungal prophylaxis
* Acyclovir for viral prophylaxis
* Hydrocortisone for stress dose and GVHD
* Mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD
* Senna and Colace for bowel care
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Cachexia
* Intubation
* Tachycardia
* Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Diffuse rhonchi in anterior lung fields
* Decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema
* Warm to touch
* Large ecchymosis on the antecubital areas with lysed bullous lesions

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
* Right lung empyema with possible air leak
* Thrombocytopenia with possible bleeding complications
* Impaired skin integrity with possible wound infection
* Alteration in nutrition with possible malnutrition
* Hypotension with possible organ dysfunction
* Pain control with possible opioid dependence
* Graft-versus-host disease with possible organ dysfunction
* Malignant neoplasm with possible progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock
* Manage atrial fibrillation with rate control and possible cardioversion
* Continue wound care and skin protection
* Monitor for signs of GVHD and adjust immunosuppressive therapy as needed
* Monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Continue nutrition support with possible transition to total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Monitor for signs of hypotension and organ dysfunction
* Manage pain with possible opioid therapy
* Monitor for signs of malignant neoplasm progression to ARDS."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. She has undergone thoracotomy for empyema and has multiple lines, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line. She is receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and corticosteroids to manage her sepsis and GVHD. She has also been started on trophic tube feeds and is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications due to her sepsis, including organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD is a significant concern, as it can lead to multi-organ failure and increased risk of infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a significant concern, as it can lead to cardiovascular instability and increased risk of stroke.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a significant concern, as it can lead to bleeding complications.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's hemothorax is a significant concern, as it can lead to bleeding complications and respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's multiple lines and tubes increase her risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition and malnutrition can lead to impaired wound healing, increased risk of infection, and decreased immune function.
9. Pain Control: The patient's acute and chronic pain requires close management to prevent complications and improve her quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors to manage sepsis and GVHD.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
3. Continue corticosteroids to manage GVHD and sepsis.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and transfuse as needed to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels closely and transfuse as needed to prevent anemia.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust her fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's nutrition closely and adjust her diet and supplementation as needed to prevent malnutrition.
8. Monitor the patient's pain closely and adjust her pain management as needed to prevent complications and improve her quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She presented with septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and corticosteroids, and has undergone thoracotomy for empyema. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her underlying infection and the presence of central lines.
2. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD may lead to further complications, such as liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, and skin lesions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of empyema, pneumonia, or other respiratory infections.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications, such as stroke, heart failure, or embolism.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's impaired nutrition may lead to further complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying medical conditions.
8. Pain: The patient's pain may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions, such as GVHD, sepsis, or respiratory failure.
9. Skin lesions: The patient's skin lesions may worsen due to GVHD, sepsis, or other underlying medical conditions.
10. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics, antifungals, and corticosteroids.
3. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications and consider cardioversion.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and consider corticosteroids.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin lesions and consider topical or systemic treatments if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's pain and consider pain management strategies if necessary.
9. Consider obtaining further imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the patient's underlying medical conditions.
10. Consider consulting with specialists, such as a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or gastroenterologist, to further evaluate and manage the patient's underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic transplantation, is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and hemodynamic instability.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 74 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 151/86 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Arterial blood gases (ABG): pH 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 351 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 24 mmHg

The patient has a history of empyema, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella oxytoca and Morganella morgani, and has undergone thoracotomy and placement of three chest tubes. She is receiving antibiotics, including tobramycin, linezolid, and meropenem, and has been started on caspofungin and acyclovir prophylaxis.

The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which is thought to be secondary to stress and infection, and has been weaned off esmolol. She has also developed respiratory alkalosis, which is thought to be due to increased respiratory rate.

The patient has severe GVHD, which is causing thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction. She is receiving mycophenolate mofetil and hydrocortisone, and has been transfused with platelets.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to GVHD, and has developed skin lesions of uncertain etiology. She has also developed hypotension, which is being treated with intravenous fluids and pressors.

The patient has altered nutrition, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, and is receiving tube feeds and parenteral nutrition. She has also developed pain, which is being managed with analgesics.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Hemodynamic instability, including cardiac arrest
4. Thrombocytopenia, including bleeding complications
5. Impaired skin integrity, including skin breakdown and infection
6. Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, including dehydration and acid-base disturbances
7. Pain, including chronic pain and opioid dependence
8. Infection, including bacteremia and pneumonia
9. Graft-versus-host disease, including liver and skin complications
10. Cancer progression, including relapse and metastasis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and hemothorax. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and analgesics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/86 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and blood urea nitrogen, but the patient's kidney function is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction is a potential risk factor for sepsis progression, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Hemothorax: The patient's hemothorax can worsen, leading to respiratory compromise, hypoxia, and even cardiac tamponade.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to skin breakdown, infection, and potential sepsis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen, leading to decreased organ perfusion, hypoxia, and even cardiac arrest.
6. Pain control: The patient's pain control is a concern, as the patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which can lead to discomfort, anxiety, and potential complications.
7. Nutritional concerns: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's glycemic control is a concern, as the patient is at risk for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, which can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and even death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplantation and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and other complications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 74 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 151/86 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 64 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation
* Right lung empyema
* Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressive agents. She is also receiving blood transfusions and platelet transfusions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection
* Organ failure

The patient's skin lesions are uncertain in etiology, but may be related to GVHD or infection. The patient's nutrition is being managed with trophic tube feeds and repletion of electrolytes as needed.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is Enterococcus and GNR empyema and
   GNR bacteremia.  Also has urine and BAL with multiple organisms,
   although all organisms are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Currently maintaining good urine output and remains hemodynamically
   stable. ID is following with recs while pending Cx develop.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue meropenem (day 5) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF for MAP > 65,  off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT (currently to suction)
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-6**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani

   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying
   infection. We will also start a fentanyl patch to adequately cover her
   underlying pain, in hopes that this will allow us to move towards
   extubation again tomorrow. She is also receiving 1L NS for volume
   resuscitation.   (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first
   reversion to atrial fib).
   - titrate esmolol
   - 1L NS IVF
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - hold off on weaning vent at this time; retry to wean PS this
   afternoon/evening if hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes,  two with
   known air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with
   extubation when tolerated. Drainage appears serosangiunous.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - no changes to her regimen at this time
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - follow LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care following, appreciate their recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of both liver and GI tract. She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure due to a right lung empyema. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a plan to extubate today. However, she is not tolerating sedation and has required frequent boluses to maintain sedation.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including:

* Septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR empyema and bacteremia
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
* Right lung empyema with serosangiunous drainage
* Severe GVHD of both liver and GI tract
* Thrombocytopenia
* Skin lesions
* History of VRE UTI

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening of septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of ARDS
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Development of further skin lesions or complications related to GVHD
* Potential for respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory function
* Need for continued mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Risk of cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and hypertension
* Risk of gastrointestinal complications due to GVHD and immunosuppression

Plan:

* Continue to manage septic shock with antibiotics and fluids
* Monitor and treat atrial fibrillation with esmolol and amiodarone as needed
* Continue to manage right lung empyema with antibiotics and drainage
* Monitor and manage GVHD with corticosteroids and other medications as needed
* Monitor and manage thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions
* Continue to manage skin lesions with wound care and antibiotics as needed
* Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and sedation as needed
* Monitor and manage glycemic control with insulin and other medications as needed
* Monitor and manage nutrition with enteral feeding and other means as needed
* Monitor and manage pain control with fentanyl and other medications as needed"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hemothorax, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, cancer, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension, and pain control. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and has been tolerating CPAP 5/5. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/91 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and their platelet count is 95 (>60) post-transfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation settings are not optimized or if there is a delay in weaning from the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's hemothorax may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further bleeding and potential cardiac tamponade.
4. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and altered nutrition may increase their risk of developing infections, such as pressure ulcers or wound infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
6. Pain: The patient's acute and chronic pain may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased anxiety, agitation, and potential respiratory complications.
7. Nutrition: The patient's altered nutrition may lead to malnutrition, decreased immune function, and increased risk of complications.
8. Cancer: The patient's cancer may progress if not properly managed, leading to increased mortality and morbidity.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Optimize mechanical ventilation settings to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Manage sepsis aggressively with antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Monitor the patient's hemostatic status and bleeding risk.
5. Implement proper wound care and nutrition support to prevent infections and malnutrition.
6. Manage the patient's pain and hypotension with appropriate medications and fluids.
7. Consider consultation with oncology and nutrition teams to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplantation and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of empyema, bacteremia, and urine and bronchial washing cultures positive for multiple organisms. She is receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely to persist, and there is a risk of progression to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other respiratory complications.
3. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Skin Lesions: The patient's skin lesions may worsen, leading to further skin integrity issues.
6. Impaired Gut Motility: The patient's gut motility may be impaired due to GVHD, leading to further nutrition and electrolyte disturbances.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist, leading to further cardiovascular instability.
8. Pain Control: The patient's acute and chronic pain may not be adequately controlled, leading to further discomfort and distress.
9. Infection: The patient's multiple organisms in urine and bronchial washings may lead to further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may worsen, leading to further cardiovascular complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as directed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue GVHD prophylaxis and monitor for signs of GVHD progression.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary.
5. Continue wound care and monitor the patient's skin lesions.
6. Consider a nutrition consult for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and replete electrolytes as necessary.
7. Continue pain control measures and monitor for signs of inadequate pain control.
8. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust vasopressors as necessary.
9. Consider a VAP prophylaxis regimen.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 41 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute cancer, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension, and pain control. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, tube feeds, and various medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which may lead to respiratory arrest or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not improving, and there is a risk of progression to septic shock, organ dysfunction, or death.
3. Cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of acute cancer, which may be progressing and causing further complications.
4. Hemothorax: The patient has a hemothorax, which may be causing respiratory compromise and potentially leading to respiratory failure.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may lead to further complications such as infection, wound dehiscence, or skin breakdown.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, which may be indicative of inadequate fluid resuscitation or cardiac dysfunction.
7. Pain control: The patient is receiving pain medication, but there is a risk of inadequate pain control, which may lead to increased pain, anxiety, and agitation.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the respiratory, urinary, or gastrointestinal tracts.
9. Bleeding: The patient has a hemothorax, which may be causing bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding or hemorrhage.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be causing cardiac dysfunction, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function, and to adjust their treatment plan accordingly. Additionally, the patient's family and caregivers should be educated on the patient's condition and the importance of providing adequate pain control and nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with multiple organisms, although all organisms are
   pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining good urine
   output and remains hemodynamically stable, with intermittent episodes
   of hypertention likely secondary to pain. Has been on PS 5/5 and is
   likely ready to be extubated today.
   - continue meropenem (day 6) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT currently on water seal
   -likely extubate today
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-8**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Currently on lopressor 50mg tid with good control. If she reverts
   back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Fentanyl patch was
   started to adequately cover her underlying pain, and ativan prn for
   anxiety. (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first reversion
   to atrial fib).
   - IVF first then esmolol prn if reverts back
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - will retry to wean off vent today and extubate
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, two with known
   air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with extubation
   when tolerated. CTs were placed to water seal this morning. If CXR
   looks unchanged will retry SBTs this afternoon with plan to extubate.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. BMT recommended switching from IV hydrocortisone to
   solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase which may be due to GVHD
   vs. acalculous cholecystitis vs. other GI etiology. At this time we
   will continue following her LFTs. If they continue to increase will
   consider RUQ US tomorrow and increasing steroid dose.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion for plt 45
   this AM.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Currently on lopressor 50mg tid with good control. If she reverts
   back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Fentanyl patch was
   started to adequately cover her underlying pain, and ativan prn for
   anxiety. (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first reversion
   to atrial fib).
   - IVF first then esmolol prn if reverts back
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - will retry to wean off vent today and extubate
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, two with known
   air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with extubation
   when tolerated. CTs were placed to water seal this morning. If CXR
   looks unchanged will retry SBTs this afternoon with plan to extubate.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above

   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. BMT recommended switching from IV hydrocortisone to
   solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase which may be due to GVHD
   vs. acalculous cholecystitis vs. other GI etiology. At this time we
   will continue following her LFTs. If they continue to increase will
   consider RUQ US tomorrow and increasing steroid dose.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant, developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure.

**Laboratory Results:**

* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.8-11.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.8-12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 42-106 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24-28 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

**Clinical Findings:**

* The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and hypertension, indicating septic shock.
* She has a history of VRE urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently on antibiotics for Enterococcus and Gram-negative rod (GNR) empyema and bacteremia.
* The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypertension, which is likely related to underlying lung injury and pain.
* She has respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and has a right lung empyema with air leak.
* The patient has severe GVHD of the liver and GI tract, with increasing liver function tests (LFTs) and platelet transfusion dependence.
* She has skin lesions, which are likely not related to GVHD, and is receiving wound care and dermatology follow-up.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic shock:** The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. **Atrial fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation may convert to rapid atrial fibrillation with RVR, leading to hypotension and cardiac arrest.
3. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.
4. **GVHD:** The patient's GVHD may worsen, leading to liver or GI tract failure, or increase the risk of infections.
5. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or increased risk of infections.
6. **Infections:** The patient's history of VRE UTI and GNR empyema and bacteremia may increase the risk of new infections, such as pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
7. **Pain management:** The patient's pain may not be adequately controlled, leading to increased anxiety, agitation, or respiratory compromise.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue antibiotics for Enterococcus and GNR empyema and bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's LFTs and platelet count closely for signs of worsening GVHD or thrombocytopenia.
3. Adjust pain management as needed to ensure adequate control.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning from mechanical ventilation.
5. Continue to follow the patient's skin lesions and wound care plan.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust as necessary to prevent complications."

   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue meropenem (day 5) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF for MAP > 65,  off pressors at this time

   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying
   infection. We will also start a fentanyl patch to adequately cover her
   underlying pain, in hopes that this will allow us to move towards
   extubation again tomorrow. She is also receiving 1L NS for volume
   resuscitation.   (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first
   reversion to atrial fib).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is Enterococcus and GNR empyema and
   GNR bacteremia.  Also has urine and BAL with multiple organisms,
   although all organisms are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Currently maintaining good urine output and remains hemodynamically
   stable. ID is following with recs while pending Cx develop.

   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplantation and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing further organ dysfunction or failure due to the ongoing sepsis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or arrhythmia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory arrest.
4. GVHD: The patient's GVHD can progress, leading to further organ damage or failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding or hemorrhage.
6. Skin lesions: The patient's skin lesions can become infected, leading to further complications.
7. Wound care: The patient's wound care is critical to prevent infection and promote healing.
8. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition is compromised, and she requires enteral nutrition to prevent malnutrition.
9. Glycemic control: The patient's glycemic control is critical to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
10. Pain control: The patient's pain control is critical to prevent pain-related complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for septic shock and respiratory failure.
2. Antiarrhythmic medication for atrial fibrillation.
3. Corticosteroids for GVHD.
4. Blood transfusions for thrombocytopenia.
5. Wound care and dressing changes for skin lesions.
6. Enteral nutrition for nutrition support.
7. Glycemic control measures to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. Pain management to prevent pain-related complications.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is Enterococcus and GNR empyema and
   GNR bacteremia.  Also has urine and BAL with multiple organisms,
   although all organisms are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Currently maintaining good urine output and remains hemodynamically
   stable. ID is following with recs while pending Cx develop.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue meropenem (day 5) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF for MAP > 65,  off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT (currently to suction)
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-6**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying
   infection. We will also start a fentanyl patch to adequately cover her
   underlying pain, in hopes that this will allow us to move towards
   extubation again tomorrow. She is also receiving 1L NS for volume
   resuscitation.   (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first
   reversion to atrial fib).
   - titrate esmolol
   - 1L NS IVF
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - hold off on weaning vent at this time; retry to wean PS this
   afternoon/evening if hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes,  two with
   known air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with
   extubation when tolerated. Drainage appears serosangiunous.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - no changes to her regimen at this time
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - follow LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care following, appreciate their recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Information:**

* The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with subsequent septic shock.
* She has a thoracotomy for empyema and is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

**Current Status:**

* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg.
* She has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors.
* She has a right lung empyema with a known air leak, and the thoracic service is following her.
* She has severe GVHD of both liver and GI tract and is receiving corticosteroids.

**Potential Complications:**

* **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock is likely caused by Enterococcus and Gram-negative rod (GNR) empyema and bacteremia. Monitoring for signs of septic shock, such as decreased urine output, hypotension, and tachycardia, is crucial.
* **Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB):** The patient's AFIB is likely caused by underlying lung injury and pain, and may require treatment with esmolol and amiodarone.
* **Right Lung Empyema:** The patient's right lung empyema may require further drainage and antibiotics to prevent complications such as pneumonia and sepsis.
* **GVHD:** The patient's severe GVHD may require further treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents to prevent further organ damage.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's thrombocytopenia may require platelet transfusions and close monitoring for bleeding.
* **Pain Control:** The patient's chronic pain may require further treatment with analgesics and consideration of alternative pain management strategies.
* **Nutrition:** The patient's altered nutrition may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent malnutrition and related complications.

**ICU Care:**

* The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function.
* She requires ongoing antibiotics and vasopressors to manage her septic shock and right lung empyema.
* She requires further treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents to manage her GVHD.
* She requires close monitoring of her platelet count and bleeding risk.
* She requires ongoing pain management and nutrition support to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 7 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR pending. Thoracic service following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   .
   Culture data
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   -RUQ U/S
   -BMT recs re: steroids
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with standing low-dose
   lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain, she is off fentanyl
   drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl patch and bolus
   fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain, palliative care consult
   to provide a good pain regimen for the long-term.  She is also quite
   anxious, which we can treat with low dose ativan or klonopin (note:
   very cachectic and low RR, caution not to oversedate. Also with
   elevated compromised liver function, avoid long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR pending to monitor for
   resolution.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. Once PO
   route is established (hopefully with Dobhoff) will start low rate TF
   and monitor for improvement in gut motility.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   -RUQ US
   -Dobhoff placement
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion yesterday.
   Today stable at 63. Will not transfuse at this time.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. Hope to place Dobhoff today and start PO
   feeds to improve GI motility. Nutrition consult to ensure she is
   getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant, developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a collapsed right lung with chest tubes in place, and is receiving oxygen therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock due to Enterococcus and Gram-negative bacterial empyema and bacteremia.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypertension.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 63, which is likely due to GVHD or bone marrow suppression secondary to sepsis.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to GVHD or acalculous cholecystitis.
6. Skin wounds: The patient has multiple skin wounds that require wound care and dermatology follow-up.
7. Nutritional impairment: The patient is cachectic and has impaired gut motility, which may require nutritional support.
8. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain that requires management with opioids and other medications.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving meropenem and caspofungin for septic shock and prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Steroids: The patient is receiving solumedrol for GVHD.
3. Lopressor: The patient is receiving IV lopressor for atrial fibrillation and hypertension.
4. Fentanyl: The patient is receiving fentanyl patch and bolus fentanyl for pain control.
5. Ativan: The patient is receiving ativan for anxiety.
6. Dobhoff placement: The patient is scheduled to have a Dobhoff tube placed for nutrition support.
7. RUQ ultrasound: The patient is scheduled to have an RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for acalculous cholecystitis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. WBC count: 9.4-11.5
2. Hemoglobin: 11.3-12.6 g/dL
3. Platelet count: 63-90
4. Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
5. Liver enzymes: Elevated ALT and AST
6. Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
7. LDH: 364 IU/L

The patient's radiology results show:

1. CXR: Collapsed right lung with chest tubes in place.
2. CT scan: Enterococcus and Gram-negative bacterial empyema and bacteremia.

The patient's medical team is concerned about the following potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's collapsed lung and respiratory failure may worsen and require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress and require additional antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may convert to rapid atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may require additional treatment.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen and require platelet transfusions.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen and require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Skin wounds: The patient's skin wounds may become infected and require additional wound care and treatment.
7. Nutritional impairment: The patient's nutritional impairment may worsen and require additional nutritional support.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU for now, with possible extubation today."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 7 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR pending. Thoracic service following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   .
   Culture data
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus

   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   -RUQ U/S
   -BMT recs re: steroids
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with standing low-dose
   lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain, she is off fentanyl
   drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl patch and bolus
   fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain, palliative care consult
   to provide a good pain regimen for the long-term.  She is also quite
   anxious, which we can treat with low dose ativan or klonopin (note:
   very cachectic and low RR, caution not to oversedate. Also with
   elevated compromised liver function, avoid long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR pending to monitor for
   resolution.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. Once PO
   route is established (hopefully with Dobhoff) will start low rate TF
   and monitor for improvement in gut motility.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   -RUQ US
   -Dobhoff placement
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion yesterday.
   Today stable at 63. Will not transfuse at this time.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. Hope to place Dobhoff today and start PO
   feeds to improve GI motility. Nutrition consult to ensure she is
   getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic transplant, developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and was treated with meropenem for septic shock. She has multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Right lung empyema with collapsed lung, treated with chest tubes and antibiotics.
2. Severe GVHD of both liver and GI tract, treated with solumedrol.
3. Thrombocytopenia, likely due to GVHD or bone marrow suppression, with a platelet count of 63 K/uL.
4. Transaminitis, possibly secondary to GVHD or acalculous cholecystitis.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and hypertension, treated with lopressor and fentanyl.
6. Cachexia, with a need for nutritional support.
7. Skin wounds, with wound care and dermatology follow-up.

The patient is currently in the ICU, extubated, and receiving supportive care. She has multiple lines, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration of lung function, potentially leading to respiratory failure.
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
3. Development of sepsis or organ dysfunction.
4. Progression of GVHD, potentially leading to liver or GI tract failure.
5. Increased risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of antibiotics.
6. Potential for cardiac arrhythmias or hypertension.
7. Need for further nutritional support to manage cachexia.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are necessary to manage her condition and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with multiple organisms, although all organisms are
   pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining good urine
   output and remains hemodynamically stable, with intermittent episodes
   of hypertention likely secondary to pain. Has been on PS 5/5 and is
   likely ready to be extubated today.
   - continue meropenem (day 6) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT currently on water seal
   -likely extubate today
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-8**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites

   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Currently on lopressor 50mg tid with good control. If she reverts
   back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Fentanyl patch was
   started to adequately cover her underlying pain, and ativan prn for
   anxiety. (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first reversion
   to atrial fib).
   - IVF first then esmolol prn if reverts back
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - will retry to wean off vent today and extubate
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, two with known
   air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with extubation
   when tolerated. CTs were placed to water seal this morning. If CXR
   looks unchanged will retry SBTs this afternoon with plan to extubate.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. BMT recommended switching from IV hydrocortisone to
   solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase which may be due to GVHD
   vs. acalculous cholecystitis vs. other GI etiology. At this time we
   will continue following her LFTs. If they continue to increase will
   consider RUQ US tomorrow and increasing steroid dose.
   - appreciate BMT recs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with subsequent septic shock. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory failure, sepsis, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being ventilated with a peak inspiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 9.4 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 45 x 10^9/L, and a lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a total bilirubin level of 30.7 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 426 IU/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including septic shock, respiratory failure, hypertension, and GVHD. The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl and midazolam, and the patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of infections.

The patient's current medications include:

* Meropenem for septic shock
* Caspofungin for prophylaxis against fungal infections
* Acyclovir for prophylaxis against viral infections
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Midazolam for sedation
* Hydralazine for hypertension
* Metoprolol for heart rate control
* Lopressor for atrial fibrillation
* Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Solumedrol for GVHD

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Hypertension
* GVHD
* Thrombocytopenia
* Impaired skin integrity
* Alteration in nutrition
* Pain control issues

The patient's current plan is to continue receiving antibiotics and other medications for septic shock, respiratory failure, and GVHD. The patient will be monitored for signs of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and will receive prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of infections. The patient's pain will be managed with fentanyl and midazolam, and the patient will be monitored for signs of hypertension and atrial fibrillation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 41-year-old individual, was extubated and experiencing all-over pain, which was managed with a bolus dose of fentanyl. The patient has a history of allergies to cefepime and aztreonam, and has received antibiotics including caspofungin, acyclovir, and meropenem. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and hydralazine, as well as other medications including metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being monitored for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver function tests. However, the patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.6 mg/dL, and the patient's lactate level is elevated at 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the absence of peripheral pulses, skin lesions, and neurologic deficits. The patient's wound is not assessed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may indicate hypertension.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's hemodynamic monitoring suggests the possibility of hemorrhage.
5. Impaired wound healing: The patient's wound is not assessed, and the patient's laboratory results suggest the possibility of impaired wound healing.
6. Nutritional deficiency: The patient's laboratory results suggest the possibility of a nutritional deficiency.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain is not well-controlled, which may indicate the need for further pain management.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is being monitored for respiratory support and other potential complications."

   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 8 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI. Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR showed improved PTX. No air leak. Thoracic service
   following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - f/u repeat cxr

   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today. No change in
   steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -f/u BMT recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with
   standing low-dose lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain,
   she is off fentanyl drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also quite anxious, which we can treat with low dose
   ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not to
   oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR showed improved ptx, per
   thoracic will leave on suction for now.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. RUQ US
   negative for cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun this
   am.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs

   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Receiving plt transfusion this am. For
   platelets of 26.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 79 bpm, blood pressure 139/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 10.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, platelet count 84 x 10^9/L, creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase 307 IU/L.
* Imaging studies: Chest X-ray (CXR) pending, but previous CXR showed a collapsed lung with improved PTX after thoracotomy and chest tube placement.
* Physical examination: The patient is awake and alert, with soft, raspy voice, and slightly improved from yesterday. She has dry, slightly icteric sclera, and significant 2+ spongy bilateral leg edema, with some upper extremity edema as well.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for ongoing sepsis and septic shock due to her prolonged ICU stay, antibiotic use, and presence of multiple organisms in her urine and bronchial washing.
2. GVHD: The patient has severe GVHD of both liver and GI tract, which may lead to continued liver enzyme elevation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and potential complications such as bleeding and infections.
3. Right lung empyema: The patient has a collapsed lung with a chest tube in place, which may lead to ongoing respiratory failure and potential complications such as pneumonia and respiratory distress.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 26 x 10^9/L, which may lead to bleeding complications and potential need for platelet transfusions.
5. Skin wounds: The patient has skin wounds that require wound care and dermatology follow-up, which may lead to potential complications such as infection and delayed healing.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may lead to ongoing cardiovascular complications and potential need for antihypertensive medications.
7. Cancer: The patient has a history of ALL, which may lead to ongoing cancer-related complications and potential need for further treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis.
2. Support breathing with pulmonary toilet as needed.
3. Repeat CXR to monitor lung status.
4. Continue IV lopressor with goal heart rate <90 beats per minute.
5. Fentanyl patch for pain control.
6. Ativan prn for anxiety.
7. Platelet transfusion to 60,000 per BMT recs.
8. Continue cellcept.
9. Nutrition consult to ensure adequate calories.
10. Wound care and dermatology follow-up.
11. Monitor LFTs and trend.
12. Consider pain, palliative care consult for long-term pain management.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 7 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR pending. Thoracic service following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   .
   Culture data
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   -RUQ U/S
   -BMT recs re: steroids
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with standing low-dose
   lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain, she is off fentanyl
   drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl patch and bolus
   fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain, palliative care consult
   to provide a good pain regimen for the long-term.  She is also quite
   anxious, which we can treat with low dose ativan or klonopin (note:
   very cachectic and low RR, caution not to oversedate. Also with
   elevated compromised liver function, avoid long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR pending to monitor for
   resolution.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. Once PO
   route is established (hopefully with Dobhoff) will start low rate TF
   and monitor for improvement in gut motility.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   -RUQ US
   -Dobhoff placement
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion yesterday.
   Today stable at 63. Will not transfuse at this time.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. Hope to place Dobhoff today and start PO
   feeds to improve GI motility. Nutrition consult to ensure she is
   getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 7 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR pending. Thoracic service following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   .

   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   -RUQ U/S
   -BMT recs re: steroids
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with standing low-dose
   lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain, she is off fentanyl
   drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl patch and bolus
   fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain, palliative care consult
   to provide a good pain regimen for the long-term.  She is also quite
   anxious, which we can treat with low dose ativan or klonopin (note:
   very cachectic and low RR, caution not to oversedate. Also with
   elevated compromised liver function, avoid long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR pending to monitor for
   resolution.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. Once PO
   route is established (hopefully with Dobhoff) will start low rate TF
   and monitor for improvement in gut motility.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   -RUQ US
   -Dobhoff placement
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion yesterday.
   Today stable at 63. Will not transfuse at this time.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. Hope to place Dobhoff today and start PO
   feeds to improve GI motility. Nutrition consult to ensure she is
   getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to the presence of multiple organisms in the urine, BAL, and empyema. The patient's hemodynamic instability and high blood pressure also increase the risk of septic shock.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated. The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further due to the presence of pneumonia and other respiratory infections.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): The patient has severe GVHD of the liver and GI tract, which can lead to further complications such as liver failure, GI bleeding, and sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac complications such as stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Right lung empyema: The patient has a right lung empyema, which can lead to further respiratory complications and potentially life-threatening infections.
7. Skin wounds: The patient has skin wounds, which can increase the risk of infection and further complications.
8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin is impaired, which can increase the risk of infection and further complications.
9. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's nutrition is altered, which can lead to malnutrition and further complications.
10. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which can increase the risk of further complications and affect the patient's quality of life.

The patient's current medications and treatments include:

* Antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia
* Antifungal medication for fungal infections

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. They have a history of cancer and are receiving treatment with Cellcept, Solumedrol, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/80 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase level, indicating inflammation and tissue damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly. This could lead to long-term lung damage and decreased lung function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase level may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if they require invasive procedures or have a coagulopathy.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased cardiovascular risk and potential complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown and infection, particularly if they have a compromised immune system.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function, increasing the risk of complications and prolonged hospital stay.
7. Pain management: The patient's acute and chronic pain may not be adequately managed, leading to decreased quality of life and potential complications such as decreased mobility and increased risk of falls.
8. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer may progress despite treatment, leading to decreased survival and quality of life.
9. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection, particularly if they have a central line or other invasive devices.
10. Organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying medical conditions may lead to organ dysfunction, particularly if they have kidney or liver disease, and may require further interventions such as dialysis or liver transplantation."

   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 8 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI. Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR showed improved PTX. No air leak. Thoracic service
   following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - f/u repeat cxr

   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today. No change in
   steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -f/u BMT recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with
   standing low-dose lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain,
   she is off fentanyl drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also quite anxious, which we can treat with low dose
   ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not to
   oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR showed improved ptx, per
   thoracic will leave on suction for now.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. RUQ US
   negative for cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun this
   am.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Receiving plt transfusion this am. For
   platelets of 26.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. TFs via Dobhoff today. Nutrition consult
   to ensure she is getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 8 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI. Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR showed improved PTX. No air leak. Thoracic service
   following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - f/u repeat cxr

   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today. No change in
   steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -f/u BMT recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with
   standing low-dose lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain,
   she is off fentanyl drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also quite anxious, which we can treat with low dose
   ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not to
   oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR showed improved ptx, per
   thoracic will leave on suction for now.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. RUQ US
   negative for cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun this
   am.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Receiving plt transfusion this am. For
   platelets of 26.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.

   # FEN: Pt is very cachectic. TFs via Dobhoff today. Nutrition consult
   to ensure she is getting appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement would be ideal for long-term
   abx, however known DVT in RUE. Would US first before PICC placement.
   This will also allow us to remove LIJ.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications.

The patient's current medical status is as follows:

* Septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia, treated with meropenem and caspofungin
* Right lung empyema with collapsed lung, treated with chest tubes and antibiotics
* Transaminitis likely secondary to GVHD or acalculous cholecystitis
* Atrial fibrillation with hypertension, treated with lopressor and fentanyl
* Thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 26, treated with platelet transfusion
* Skin wounds and impaired skin integrity
* Malnutrition with cachexia, treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and nutrition consult
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Worsening of septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of multi-organ failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and prolonged antibiotic use
* Progression of GVHD and its associated complications
* Development of respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and prolonged ICU stay
* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension due to atrial fibrillation and beta-blocker use
* Risk of liver failure and need for liver transplantation due to severe GVHD and transaminitis

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continued antibiotics for septic shock and empyema
* Platelet transfusion to maintain platelet count above 60,000
* Fentanyl patch and bolus fentanyl for pain management
* Lopressor for atrial fibrillation and hypertension
* Solumedrol for GVHD
* Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for malnutrition
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to monitor for complications and adjust treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 9 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with same organisms that are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. Per thoracics CTs
   placed to water seal, follow up CXR without collapse or PTX. She is
   hemodynamically stable with good UOP (autodiuresing). At this time it
   is reasonable to remove the Aline and monitor for improvement.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - remove A-line
   -complete meropenem course, will put in for PICC request
   .
   Culture data

   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today with decreased
   bilirubin. No change in steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -continue methylprednisone for now
   -trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. She is on metoprolol for several days on which she has
   successfully remained in NSR. For pain, she is covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also anxious at times, which we can treat with low
   dose ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not
   to oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - metoprolol 50mg tid po
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes now on water
   seal, breathing stable and repeat CXR without PTX
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. RUQ US negative for
   cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun. Steroids per BMT
   recs.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - methylprednisone 20mg qam, 15mg qpm
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   -Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 9 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with same organisms that are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. Per thoracics CTs
   placed to water seal, follow up CXR without collapse or PTX. She is
   hemodynamically stable with good UOP (autodiuresing). At this time it
   is reasonable to remove the Aline and monitor for improvement.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - remove A-line
   -complete meropenem course, will put in for PICC request
   .

   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today with decreased
   bilirubin. No change in steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -continue methylprednisone for now
   -trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. She is on metoprolol for several days on which she has
   successfully remained in NSR. For pain, she is covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also anxious at times, which we can treat with low
   dose ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not
   to oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - metoprolol 50mg tid po
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes now on water
   seal, breathing stable and repeat CXR without PTX
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. RUQ US negative for
   cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun. Steroids per BMT
   recs.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - methylprednisone 20mg qam, 15mg qpm
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care

   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   -Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
