You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been experiencing small amounts of hemoptysis and has been receiving heparin, which has been held due to bleeding. The patient has also been receiving antibiotics and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for clear lung fields, with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with present bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine level. The patient's troponin-T level is normal, and his calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding diathesis, as evidenced by the hemoptysis and elevated INR, may lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism may lead to respiratory failure, particularly if not adequately treated.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal failure, particularly if not adequately treated.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip started
   overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at baseline in high
   90s on 3L.
   - hold coumadin tonight with goal to be therapeutic 2.5-3
   - start IV heparin for now; consider transition to lovenox soon
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, azithro
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx

   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and developing a right leg cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.5°C (99.5°F), HR: 86 bpm, BP: 116/63 mmHg, RR: 17 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 100%
* Physical examination: Alert, oriented, no acute distress; sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear; supple neck, no jugular venous distension; clear lung fields, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi; regular heart rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; soft, non-tender abdomen; warm, well-perfused extremities
* Laboratory results: WBC: 10.3 x 10^9/L, Hct: 33.1%, Plt: 287 x 10^9/L, Cr: 1.1 mg/dL, TropT: <0.01 ng/mL, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: Bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli, patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base, small left pleural effusion, extensive lymphadenopathy in the left axilla and mediastinum

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plan include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE): Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin, most likely source of PE is known LLE DVT, now with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip started overnight
* Pneumonia: Has PNA seen on the CT scan, has a cough on exam today and has some sputum production
* Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Metastatic, due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but likely will have to defer now
* Diastolic CHF: Appears euvolemic on exam, has mild peripheral edema, L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload
* Hypertension: Stable, normotensive
* Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
* Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
* FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary infarction due to the bilateral PEs
* Pneumonia worsening due to the patient's immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization
* Diastolic CHF worsening due to fluid overload or further cardiac dysfunction
* Hypertension worsening due to the patient's underlying condition and potential medication changes
* Hyperlipidemia worsening due to the patient's underlying condition and potential medication changes
* Hypothyroidism worsening due to the patient's underlying condition and potential medication changes
* Recurrence of NSCLC due to the patient's metastatic disease

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Heparin drip started overnight to achieve therapeutic INR
* Consider transition to lovenox soon
* Continue nebulizers for pulmonary embolism treatment
* Morphine PRN for pain control
* Continue vanco, cefepime, and azithro for pneumonia treatment
* Legionella antigen and sputum sample sent for further testing
* Consider heme onc consult for lung cancer management
* Hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea treatment
* Hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow for diastolic CHF treatment
* Continue statin for hyperlipidemia treatment
* Continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism treatment
* No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet for FEN treatment
* Coumadin and heparin gtt for prophylaxis
* Peripheral lines and replete electrolytes for ICU care"

   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at

   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right lower extremity cellulitis.

The patient has developed bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs), which are likely related to her known LLE DVT. She has been placed on an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and is currently on a heparin drip. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic, and she is at risk for bleeding.

The patient has also developed pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. She has a cough and is producing sputum, and a sputum sample has been sent for Legionella antigen testing.

The patient's lung cancer is metastatic, and she was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but may need to defer it due to her current condition. She has not had chemotherapy or radiation in the past, only local resection.

The patient has mild peripheral edema, which is likely related to her DVT rather than fluid overload. She is normotensive and has been restarted on metoprolol. Her hypertension medications have been held, and she will be restarted on lasix as her blood pressure permits.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.3-15.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.9-12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 287-315 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.1-1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR and heparin drip
* Pneumonia progression or development of new infectious processes
* Pulmonary infarcts or further pulmonary embolism
* Hemorrhagic complications related to cancer or anticoagulation therapy
* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance
* Cardiac complications related to diastolic CHF or hypertension
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Hemorrhagic cystitis or other hemorrhagic complications related to cancer or anticoagulation therapy

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Discontinuing coumadin and holding heparin drip until the patient's INR is <75
* Restarting heparin at a low dose when the patient's PTT is <75
* Considering transition to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux
* Continuing nebulizers for pulmonary therapy
* Morphine for pain control
* Considering PICC line for oncologic treatment and blood draws/access
* Holding dexamethasone taper for now
* Consulting heme onc for lung cancer management
* Holding lasix tonight and restarting as needed tomorrow
* Continuing statin for hyperlipidemia
* Continuing levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Repleting electrolytes and providing regular diet
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity (RLE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and developing a right lower extremity cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is being treated with IV heparin and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a slightly sub-therapeutic INR. She is hemodynamically stable, with a baseline oxygen saturation in the high 90s on 2 liters of oxygen. Her chest pain has improved, and she has remained afebrile since discontinuing antibiotics.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Recurrent thromboembolism: The patient has had multiple episodes of DVT and PE, and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
2. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and PTT increase her risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Hematuria: The patient has developed hematuria, which may be related to her supratherapeutic INR and PTT.
4. Hemoptysis/hematemesis: The patient has developed hemoptysis/hematemesis, which may be related to her supratherapeutic INR and PTT.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient has mild peripheral edema, which may be related to her DVT rather than fluid overload.
6. SOB: The patient's SOB may be related to her PEs and may worsen with further thrombotic events.
7. HTN: The patient's HTN is stable, but may worsen with further thrombotic events.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of further thrombotic events.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may increase her risk of further thrombotic events.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN may increase her risk of further thrombotic events.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for further thrombotic events, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and PTT increase her risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria may worsen with further thrombotic events.
4. Hemoptysis/hematemesis: The patient's hemoptysis/hematemesis may worsen with further thrombotic events.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF may worsen with further thrombotic events.
6. SOB: The patient's SOB may worsen with further thrombotic events.
7. HTN: The patient's HTN may worsen with further thrombotic events.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen with further thrombotic events.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen with further thrombotic events.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN may worsen with further thrombotic events."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip
   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at
   low dose when ptt < 75; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro; patient has remained afebrile
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip
   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at
   low dose when ptt < 75; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro; patient has remained afebrile
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, lisionpril, lasix (restart PRN for
   hypertension)
   - Patient has been successfully restarted on metoprolol; will add back
   lasix as blood pressure permits)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity (RLE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (dCHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.

The patient has developed bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is currently receiving heparin drip, which was restarted overnight due to supratherapeutic INR. She is hemodynamically stable and saturating at baseline in the high 90s on 3L oxygen.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition are:

1. Recurrent thromboembolism: The patient has a history of recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin, and the current supratherapeutic INR may increase the risk of further thromboembolic events.
2. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and the use of heparin drip may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently receiving antibiotics for PNA. The risk of infection is increased due to her underlying condition and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's diastolic CHF and pulmonary hypertension may worsen with the development of PEs and the use of heparin drip.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's PEs and PNA may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and the use of heparin drip may lead to hemodynamic instability, which may require further interventions.
7. Cancer progression: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress despite treatment, which may lead to further complications and decreased quality of life.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

1. Discontinuation of coumadin due to failure.
2. Holding IV heparin until PTT < 75 and restarting at a low dose.
3. Considering transition to lovenox soon.
4. Continuing nebulizers for PNA treatment.
5. Morphine for pain control.
6. Considering PICC for oncologic treatment.
7. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and infection.
8. Consulting heme onc for lung cancer management.
9. Holding dexamethasone taper for now.
10. Restarting lasix as needed tomorrow.

The patient's family members have been notified, and the patient has signed an ICU consent form. The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Supratherapeutic INR yesterday, now slightly sub-therapeutic.
   She is hemodynamically stable and satting at baseline in high 90s on
   2L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - continue IV heparin gtt; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PRN
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: PNA seen on the CT scan, but not impressive; patient afebrile.
   Discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro on [**3-2**]; patient has remained
   afebrile since with Tmax 99.6 on night of [**3-2**] at MN.
   - legionella antigen, sputum sample : not yet ordered
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - no chemo currently; Onc recs: most likely will start less aggressive
   chemo Friday or early next week
   - continue folate
   - SW consult?
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix for now, start as needed
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation; onc following for lung ca
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, lisionpril, lasix (restart PRN for
   hypertension)
   - Patient has been successfully restarted on metoprolol; will add back
   lasix as blood pressure permits
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right lower extremity cellulitis. She has since developed bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and has been placed on an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Her INR was supratherapeutic yesterday, but is now slightly sub-therapeutic.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has mild peripheral edema, but is euvolemic on examination. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 342 K/uL.

The patient's medical history is significant for recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin, and it is likely that the source of the PEs is her known LLE DVT. She is currently receiving IV heparin and may be transitioned to lovenox soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding due to supratherapeutic INR and potential sensitivity to anticoagulants.
2. Recurrent thromboembolism despite anticoagulation therapy.
3. Development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
4. Worsening of diastolic CHF due to fluid overload or increased afterload.
5. Hypoxemia due to bilateral PEs.
6. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices.
7. Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance due to inadequate nutrition and fluid management.
8. Increased risk of bleeding due to continued use of anticoagulation therapy.

Given the patient's history of recurrent thromboembolism and potential sensitivity to anticoagulants, it is essential to monitor her closely for signs of bleeding and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary. Additionally, her oncology team should be consulted to discuss the optimal management of her metastatic NSCLC and potential chemotherapy options."
