   Assessment and Plan
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorilly compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient
   switched to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile.
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8) given recent course and
   acute stressors.
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.
   .
   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics at this point; add vanco and changing
   cipro to ceftriaxone as above.  Infectious workup.
   - LFTs and LDH wnl
   - Start thiamine 100 mg IV daily.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Resolved.  Likely lactic acidosis with very
   elevated lactate as above.  Also with small ketones in urine.
   - Bolus another liter NS.
   - D5 IVFs if prolonged NPO; insulin.
   .
   # Anisocoria.  Likely med effect from atrovent.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # LE pain and edema.
   - LENIs negative; improvement with lasix. will diurese PRN.
   .
   # FEN. NPO with NIPPV mask, sips prn.
   # Ppx. HSQ, H2B.
   # Access. PIV x 2 though difficult access patient, CVL vs. PICC today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD, TBM, and respiratory distress. She was admitted with BiPAP requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. The patient was switched to an aerosol mask due to difficulty coughing, and then switched back to BiPAP due to worsening acidosis and hypercarbia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 69 bpm
* Blood pressure: 136/81 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* White blood cell count: 15.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 150 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Lactate: 2.6 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachypneic and alert
* Marked anisocoria (right 3->2, left 7->6)
* EOMI (eyes moving outward and inward)
* No wheezes or rhonchi appreciated, though poor effort
* Bibasilar crackles
* Regular heart rate and rhythm
* No murmur appreciated
* Soft, obese abdomen with no tenderness
* 1+ bilateral edema with right calf tenderness

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated D-dimer (815 ng/mL)
* Elevated BNP (815 pg/mL)
* Metabolic acidosis with small ketones in urine
* Lactic acidosis with elevated lactate (2.6 mmol/L)
* Normal liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase

The patient's diagnosis is respiratory distress, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. The differential diagnosis includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Serial ABGs
* Sputum culture and BAL if bronched
* Urine legionella antigen
* Check for flu and viral infections
* PE workup with D-dimer, VQ, or CTA
* Empiric heparin IV
* IV lasix for fluid overload
* Consider intubation if acidosis persists
* Continue low-dose steroids
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Thiamine 100 mg IV daily
* LFTs and LDH
* D5 IVFs and insulin if prolonged NPO

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Sepsis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Metabolic acidosis
* Lactic acidosis
* Hypovolemia
* Thiamine deficiency

 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient switched
   to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile. Consider DC vanc tomorrow if clinically
   stable and no e/o GPCs in culture data
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8 yesterday) will wean to
   25 q 12h today and continue to wean c pred tomorrow
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.
   .
   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics at this point; add vanco and changing
   cipro to ceftriaxone as above.  Infectious workup.
   - LFTs and LDH wnl
   - rec/d thiamine yesterday, but will dc today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Resolved.  Likely lactic acidosis with very
   elevated lactate as above.  Also with small ketones in urine.
   - Bolus another liter NS.
   - D5 IVFs if prolonged NPO; insulin.
   .
   # Anisocoria.  Likely med effect from atrovent.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # LE pain and edema.
   - LENIs negative; improvement with lasix. will diurese PRN.
   .
   # FEN. NPO with NIPPV mask, sips prn.
   # Ppx. HSQ, H2B.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory distress. She was initially on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) but switched to an aerosol mask due to difficulty breathing. The patient is experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/81 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on an aerosol mask. She is receiving antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and vancomycin, and is being treated for a possible pneumonia or other respiratory infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, with a value of 2.6 mmol/L, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 15.2 mg/dL. Her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and her blood glucose level is 158 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination shows anisocoria, with marked anisocoria in the right eye and moderate anisocoria in the left eye. Her neck is obese, and her chest is clear to auscultation. Her heart is regular, with no murmurs appreciated. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities show 1+ bilateral edema with right calf tenderness.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, which is being treated with lopressor. She has also been taking clonidine for hypertension. The patient has a history of COPD, but denies having emphysema or asthma.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and elevated lactate levels suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and tachycardia suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that she may have pneumonia.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's elevated lactate levels and tachycardia suggest that she may be at risk for pulmonary embolism.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and metabolic acidosis suggest that she may be at risk for metabolic acidosis.
6. Hypovolemia: The patient's tachycardia and elevated lactate levels suggest that she may be at risk for hypovolemia.
7. Thiamine deficiency: The patient's elevated lactate levels and metabolic acidosis suggest that she may be at risk for thiamine deficiency.

Based on the patient's progress note, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust her fluid therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her electrolyte therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication therapy as needed.
6. Consider intubating the patient if her respiratory status worsens or if she becomes hypoxic.
7. Consider switching the patient to a different antibiotic if her symptoms do not improve with the current antibiotic regimen.
8. Consider adding a diuretic to the patient's medication regimen if her fluid status worsens.
9. Consider adding a medication to the patient's regimen to help manage her hypertension.
10. Consider adding a medication to the patient's regimen to help manage her tachycardia."

   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient switched
   to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile. Consider DC vanc tomorrow if clinically
   stable and no e/o GPCs in culture data
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8 yesterday) will wean to
   25 q 12h today and continue to wean c pred tomorrow
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.

   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   A/P: 55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, PE.  ALso
   metabolic acidosis from lactate as below likely to be contributing, as
   patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to
   satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint. Patient switched
   to aerosol mask last night, given ativan, now with worsening
   acidosis/hypercarbia--> will switch back to BiPAP.
   - Serial ABGs
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag.
   - check flu/virals.
   - PE workup - D dimer 815; to either VQ (abnl CXR) or CTA (I- allergy)
   but may need.  Empiric heparin IV while undergoing workup.
   - BNP  374; gave IV lasix b/c appeared fluid overloaded as well; will
   evaluate pulm edema on CXR
   - IP aware, f/u recs.
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; consider broadening given
   recent steroids if febrile. Consider DC vanc tomorrow if clinically
   stable and no e/o GPCs in culture data
   - Consider intubation if acidosis though to be more related to WOB and
   need for rest, or if patient fatigues.
   - continue low dose steroids (hydrocort 25 Q8 yesterday) will wean to
   25 q 12h today and continue to wean c pred tomorrow
   .
   # Tachycardia. Improved. Likely due to med effect (nebs) vs. sepsis vs.
   hypovolemia vs. PE.  On lopressor at baseline.
   - lopressor restarted
   - Infectious workup
   - Bolus 1 liter NS and further prn.
   .
   # Elevated lactate.  Seems to be maintaining perfusion with normal BPs,
   though tachycardic.  No evidence of bowel ischemia/abd benign.  No
   metformin use.  No risk factor for thiamine deficiency.  Presume
   hypoperfusion vs. significant work of breathing at this point, possibly
   more likely to hypoperfusion given improvement in lactates with fluids.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics at this point; add vanco and changing
   cipro to ceftriaxone as above.  Infectious workup.
   - LFTs and LDH wnl
   - rec/d thiamine yesterday, but will dc today
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Resolved.  Likely lactic acidosis with very
   elevated lactate as above.  Also with small ketones in urine.
   - Bolus another liter NS.
   - D5 IVFs if prolonged NPO; insulin.
   .
   # Anisocoria.  Likely med effect from atrovent.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # LE pain and edema.
   - LENIs negative; improvement with lasix. will diurese PRN.
   .
   # FEN. NPO with NIPPV mask, sips prn.
   # Ppx. HSQ, H2B.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increasing oxygen requirements and acidosis. This may indicate a COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, which may be due to hypoperfusion, significant work of breathing, or other underlying conditions. This may lead to further complications if not addressed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to medication, sepsis, hypovolemia, or pulmonary embolism. This may lead to cardiac complications if not managed.
4. Anisocoria: The patient's pupils are irregular, which may be due to medication or other underlying conditions. This may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure or other neurological complications.
5. LE pain and edema: The patient's legs are painful and swollen, which may be due to venous stasis or other underlying conditions. This may lead to further complications if not managed.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient is receiving diuretic therapy and has a fluid balance issue, which may lead to further complications if not managed.
7. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a high risk of infection due to their underlying conditions.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray is abnormal, which may indicate pneumonia or other pulmonary complications.
9. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's D-dimer is elevated, which may indicate a pulmonary embolism or other thrombotic complications.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and they may be at risk for further cardiovascular complications if not managed.

In summary, the patient's daily progress note highlights several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, CHF.  VQ
   scan yesterday negative for PE. Echo showed normal LVEF, but she did
   get 1.5 liters off in past day and has improved breathing; possible
   diastolic component. ALso metabolic acidosis from lactate was likely to
   be contributing, as patient with poor respiratory reserve and unlikely
   to be able to satisfactorily compensate from respiratory standpoint,
   but lactate has now normalized. Patient with stable ABG's only
   requiring BiPAP
   - sputum culture if able.  BAL if bronched. Urine legionella ag
   negative. Viral cultures negative.
   - heparin drip d/c'ed as VQ scan normal
   - BNP  374; Likely diastolic CHF based on TTE. diuresed 1.5L yesterday;
   will diurese additional liter and likely start 40mg lasix PO daily.
   - IP aware, no plans to place stent inhouse, given possibility of
   infection and fact that stent not likely to address acute symptoms;
   recommended GERD control (will switch from H2B to PPI) and sleep study
   - Vanc azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP; Still no sputum sample. Not
   febrile, will d/c vanc/ceftriaxone and give just azithromycin x 5 days
   for tx of CAP
   - continue rapid taper of low dose steroids -wean from hydrocort 25mg
   Q12 yesterday to prednisone 20mg today
   -large component of anxiety- will give ativan PRN, should contact PCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and respiratory distress. She was admitted with tachycardia, elevated lactate, and BiPAP requirement. The patient's condition has improved with fluid resuscitation and diuresis. The differential diagnosis includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's lab results show normal LVEF, possible diastolic component, and normalized lactate levels. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a pending MRSA screen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and tachycardia may progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's COPD and TBM may increase her risk of developing pneumonia, which could be complicated by antibiotic-resistant organisms.
3. CHF: The patient's possible diastolic component and elevated lactate levels may indicate underlying CHF, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. DVT: The patient's immobility and COPD may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could be complicated by pulmonary embolism.
5. VAP: The patient's respiratory support and potential aspiration may increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels may indicate underlying metabolic acidosis, which could worsen if not managed properly.
7. Anisocoria: The patient's anisocoria may be a sign of medication side effects or other underlying conditions that need to be monitored and managed.
8. LE pain and edema: The patient's LE pain and edema may be related to her underlying medical conditions or medication side effects, which need to be monitored and managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Consider intubation if the patient's respiratory distress worsens or if she becomes fatigued.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
4. Consider DC vanc if the patient gets a sputum sample and is not febrile.
5. Continue diuresis and monitor for signs of fluid overload.
6. Monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's anisocoria and adjust medication as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's LE pain and edema and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with COPD, TBM, and respiratory distress. She was admitted with tachycardia and elevated lactate levels. Her vital signs have stabilized, and she is currently receiving BiPAP therapy. Her respiratory status is stable, and she is no longer requiring oxygen supplementation. She has a history of anxiety and is being treated with ativan as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the presence of infrahilar consolidation at both lung bases could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the consolidation.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's BNP level is elevated, and her echocardiogram showed normal LVEF but possible diastolic component. This could be contributing to her respiratory distress.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level was initially elevated, but it has now normalized. However, she may still be at risk for developing metabolic acidosis due to her underlying respiratory condition.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to her immobility and respiratory condition. She is receiving prophylactic heparin therapy, but further evaluation is needed to determine if she has developed VTE.
5. Sleep Apnea: The patient's sleep study is pending, and she may be at risk for developing sleep apnea due to her respiratory condition.
6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient is at risk for developing GERD due to her respiratory condition and is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent this.
7. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is being treated with ativan as needed. She may require further evaluation and treatment for anxiety.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk for developing further infections due to her respiratory condition and immobility."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   55F with COPD, TBM, admitted with respiratory distress; with BiPAP
   requirement, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
   .
   # Respiratory distress.  Patient with baseline significant TBM and
   ?other type of COPD, though patient denies emphysema/asthma.  Unclear
   reason for having TBM.  Differential for acute change includes COPD
   exacerbation (if reactive airways truly present), pneumonia, CHF.  VQ
   scan negative for PE. Echo c/w diastolic CHF. Also metabolic acidosis
   from lactate was likely to be contributing, as patient with poor
   respiratory reserve and unlikely to be able to satisfactorily
   compensate from respiratory standpoint, but lactate has now normalized.
   Patient no longer requiring BiPAP.
   - sputum culture if able.  Urine legionella ag negative. Viral cultures
   negative. On five day course of azithromycin.
   - BNP  374; Likely diastolic CHF based on TTE. diuresed 600cc
   yesterday; will diurese additional liter and likely start 40mg lasix PO
   daily. Will trend daily weights.
   - IP aware, no plans to place stent inhouse, given possibility of
   infection and fact that stent not likely to address acute symptoms;
   recommended GERD control (PPI) and sleep study.
   -f/u sleep recommendations
   - continue rapid taper of low dose steroids -wean from prednisone 20mg
   to 10mg prednisone tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Tuberculosis (TBM), and respiratory distress. She was admitted with tachycardia, elevated lactate, and required BiPAP support. The patient's condition has improved, and she is no longer requiring BiPAP. Her lactate levels have normalized, and she is now on a five-day course of azithromycin.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Tracheobronchomalacia (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
3. Tachycardia
4. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) based on echocardiogram (BNP 374)
5. Metabolic acidosis from lactate (resolved)
6. Respiratory distress (improved)
7. Anxiety (managed with ativan PRN)

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and treatments, including:

1. Sputum culture (pending)
2. Urine Legionella antigen screen (negative)
3. Viral cultures (negative)
4. Blood culture (pending)
5. Urine culture (final report pending)
6. Echocardiogram (diastolic CHF)
7. VQ scan (negative for pulmonary embolism)
8. Azithromycin therapy (five-day course)
9. Diuresis with Lasix (600cc yesterday, additional liter planned)
10. Prednisone taper (weaning from 20mg to 10mg tomorrow)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Pneumonia
3. Pneumothorax
4. Pleural effusion
5. Diastolic CHF exacerbation
6. Metabolic acidosis
7. Anxiety exacerbation
8. Skin breakdown or infection
9. Infection related to indwelling lines or devices
10. Pulmonary embolism

The patient's plan is to continue on a five-day course of azithromycin, diuresis with Lasix, and prednisone taper. She will also receive prophylactic therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is planned for transfer to the floor."
