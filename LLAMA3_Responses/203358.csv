   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.  Currently appears well compensated
   and near euvolemic.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to maintain
   kidney perfusion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a mechanical aortic valve, who was admitted to the ICU after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic hypotension. The patient underwent a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and was restarted on heparin post-op. However, they developed a gluteal hematoma, which led to a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight. The patient received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently being held on heparin and coumadin.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including acute anemia, mechanical aortic valve, hypotension/orthostatic hypotension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium. They are currently on several medications, including heparin, coumadin, statin, and tramadol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding into the gluteal hematoma may lead to further complications, including compartment syndrome, foot drop, or even cardiac tamponade.
2. Acute anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications, including hypovolemic shock, cardiac instability, or respiratory distress.
3. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension may lead to further complications, including organ dysfunction, cardiac arrest, or even death.
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient's underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy may worsen with ongoing hypotension and bleeding, leading to further cardiac complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to further worsening of acute renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis.
6. Delirium: The patient's ongoing delirium may worsen with ongoing hypotension, bleeding, and other complications, potentially leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's ongoing bleeding and hypotension may lead to cardiovascular instability, potentially requiring intubation, vasopressors, or even cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and re-started on heparin gtt post-op due to a mechanical aortic valve. They developed a R gluteal hematoma, which was identified on abdominal CT. The patient has undergone 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] and has an INR of 1.5 and PTT of 27. The patient is currently off heparin gtt and Coumadin due to ongoing bleeding.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and A.C.E inhibitors. They have a mechanical aortic valve and are on hold for anticoagulation due to active bleeding. The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 45% and is currently experiencing hypotension and orthostatic hypotension.

The patient has acute anemia due to the R gluteal hematoma and is being monitored for compartment syndrome. They are also being monitored for acute renal failure, which is improving gradually.

The patient has a history of delirium and is being managed with frequent reorientation, avoiding narcotics for pain, and using tramadol and Haldol as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, potentially leading to further hypotension, anemia, and organ dysfunction.
2. Development of compartment syndrome in the R lower extremity, potentially leading to permanent nerve damage or limb loss.
3. Acute renal failure, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension, potentially leading to further cardiovascular instability.
5. Delirium, potentially leading to further cognitive decline and increased risk of falls.
6. Infection, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to increased risk of bleeding.
8. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to further bleeding complications.
9. Vitamin K deficiency, potentially leading to coagulopathy and bleeding.
10. Atrial fibrillation, potentially leading to further cardiovascular instability and stroke risk."

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.  Currently appears well compensated
   and near euvolemic.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to maintain
   kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following conditions and potential medical complications are noted:

1. **Gluteal Hematoma**: The patient has a significant gluteal hematoma following recent hip hemiarthroplasty and re-started on heparin gtt. This condition is potentially life-threatening and may lead to:
	* Compartment syndrome
	* Foot drop
	* Hemodynamic instability
	* Infection
2. **Acute Anemia**: The patient has anemia due to the gluteal hematoma, which may lead to:
	* Hypovolemic shock
	* Cardiac compromise
	* Renal failure
3. **Mechanical Aortic Valve**: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and is currently off anticoagulation due to active bleeding. This may lead to:
	* Thrombosis
	* Embolism
4. **Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension**: The patient has a history of hypotension and orthostatic hypotension, which may lead to:
	* Syncope
	* Cardiac compromise
5. **Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**: The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 45%, which may lead to:
	* Cardiac failure
	* Arrhythmias
6. **Acute Renal Failure**: The patient has acute renal failure, which may lead to:
	* Electrolyte imbalance
	* Metabolic acidosis
	* Chronic kidney disease
7. **Delirium**: The patient has delirium, which may lead to:
	* Confusion
	* Agitation
	* Increased risk of falls
8. **CAD**: The patient has CAD, which may lead to:
	* Myocardial infarction
	* Cardiac arrhythmias

Based on these conditions and potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, with a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure in the 40s. The patient has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has a hematocrit (Hct) of 24.2%.
2. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing bleeding into the right gluteal hematoma, which is causing hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute anemia: The patient's Hct is 24.2%, which is below the normal range.
4. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient's mechanical aortic valve is not anticoagulated due to ongoing bleeding.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%, indicating ischemic cardiomyopathy.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving gradually.
7. Delirium: The patient is reported to be confused and disoriented, and is receiving frequent reorientation and sedation as needed.
8. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension: The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension, which may be contributing to his current hypotension.
9. CAD: The patient has coronary artery disease, which is being managed with statin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Further bleeding into the right gluteal hematoma, which could lead to worsening hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
2. Development of compartment syndrome in the right leg, which could lead to permanent nerve damage.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to ongoing bleeding and hypotension.
4. Cardiac arrest due to worsening ischemic cardiomyopathy and hypotension.
5. Further decline in renal function, which could lead to worsening acute renal failure.
6. Development of sepsis due to ongoing bleeding and potential infection.
7. Worsening delirium, which could lead to further complications such as falls and pressure ulcers.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hematocrit closely, and transfuse PRBCs as needed to maintain a hematocrit of 21% or higher.
2. Restart heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin until bleeding issues stabilize.
3. Monitor the patient's right leg for signs of compartment syndrome, and evacuate the hematoma if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute anemia with transfusions as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, and consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with fluid resuscitation and diuretics as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and provide frequent reorientation and sedation as needed.
8. Consider restarting anticoagulation with warfarin once bleeding issues stabilize.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
10. Consider restarting beta-blocker therapy once bleeding issues stabilize."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual who weighs 104.1 kg, with a current Hct of 24.2%. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension, with a SBP of 75 and MAPs in the 40s. The patient has received a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs, resulting in a Hct of 24.4 before and 24.2 after.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.9°C, Tcurrent of 36.3°C, HR of 82 bpm, BP of 90/58 mmHg, RR of 14 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 14.1, Hct of 23.3, and platelet count of 550. The patient's creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, glucose is 114 mg/dL, and calcium is 7.8 mg/dL. The patient's INR is 1.5, and the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to assess certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and movement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still in the 40s, which may indicate ongoing hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Bleeding: The patient has received a transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs, and the patient's INR is 1.5, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.19, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is 1.7 mg/dL, which may indicate renal dysfunction or failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count and CRP, which may indicate sepsis.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and central venous catheters.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to critical illness and potential bleeding.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to mechanical ventilation and potential bacterial colonization of the endotracheal tube.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and a mechanical aortic valve, who developed a gluteal hematoma and was started on heparin. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight, and he was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's anticoagulation was held due to active bleeding, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is currently 1.5. The patient's blood pressure (BP) is currently 80's/40's, and he is at risk for hypotension and orthostatic hypotension. The patient also has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's active bleeding into the gluteal hematoma is a significant concern, and the risk of further bleeding or compartment syndrome needs to be closely monitored.
2. Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension: The patient's BP is currently 80's/40's, and he is at risk for further hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, which could lead to decreased perfusion to vital organs.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but the risk of further kidney damage due to hypotension and active bleeding needs to be closely monitored.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a concern, and frequent reorientation and avoidance of narcotics for pain management are necessary to minimize further confusion and agitation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and mechanical aortic valve make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Infection: The patient's risk of developing an infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), needs to be closely monitored, especially given his current bleeding and active medical treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's bleeding and hematocrit levels, and transfuse PRBCs as necessary to maintain a stable hematocrit.
2. Hold anticoagulation therapy until the patient's bleeding has stabilized, and then re-start at a lower dose and without bolus.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's BP and cardiac status, and consider starting mild diuresis if the patient becomes volume overloaded.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider starting dialysis if the patient's kidney function continues to deteriorate.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with frequent reorientation and avoidance of narcotics for pain management.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider starting cardiac medications, such as beta blockers or ACE inhibitors, once the patient's bleeding has stabilized."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent right hip ORIF complicated by post-operative bleeding and was admitted to the ICU with significant hemorrhage. He has a history of mechanical valve replacement and required anticoagulation, which was held since 1 pm on [**2128-7-29**]. The patient has moderate and persistent bleeding, requiring 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) in the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/57 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, and he is receiving no respiratory support. His physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no evidence of impaired motor strength in his extremities. However, he has an absent right and left radial pulse, and his left DP pulse is not assessed.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 550. His coagulation profile shows an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, and his liver function tests are mildly elevated. His renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Ongoing bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level has shown minimal response to 1 unit of PRBC, suggesting ongoing blood loss.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and it may lead to decreased oxygen delivery to his tissues.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating compromised renal function.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and his blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may exacerbate his heart failure.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial, and it may be related to his underlying medical conditions, medications, or other factors.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infection, given his prolonged hospitalization and invasive medical devices.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to his prolonged immobility and compromised circulation.

Based on these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these complications. His anticoagulation therapy should be restarted at the earliest possible time, and his blood pressure should be carefully managed to prevent exacerbation of his heart failure. His delirium should be managed with medications and other interventions as needed. His anemia should be treated with further transfusions as necessary, and his renal function should be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

   Disposition: ICU until bleeding stopped<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma due to bleeding into his hip. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped from 25.6 to 23.6, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an increase in Hct to 26.3.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which was stopped after the bleeding episode. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic at 1.5, and his PTT is normal.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Acute anemia due to the right gluteal hematoma, which may lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension, which may be exacerbated by the bleeding and anticoagulation therapy.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, which may worsen due to the patient's decreased cardiac function and potential volume overload.
4. Acute renal failure, which may be caused by hypotension, bleeding, and decreased kidney perfusion.
5. Delirium, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, medications, and hypovolemic shock.
6. Compartment syndrome, which may develop in the patient's right gluteal region due to the hematoma and compression of the surrounding tissues.
7. Hematoma evacuation, which may be necessary if the patient develops foot drop or other signs of compartment syndrome.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Restarting heparin therapy once the bleeding has stabilized.
2. Monitoring the patient's Hct level and transfusing PRBCs as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 21.
3. Continuing to hold Coumadin until the bleeding issues stabilize.
4. Providing serial exams to evaluate for compartment syndrome.
5. Monitoring the patient's cardiac status, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
6. Managing the patient's pain and delirium with tramadol and haloperidol as needed.
7. Providing close monitoring of the patient's renal function and fluid status.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma. The patient was anticoagulated after surgery, which led to the bleeding into the hip.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 729 K/uL, and white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL. The patient's coagulation profile shows an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.4 seconds, and activated clotting time (ACT) of 16.9 seconds.

The patient's medical conditions include acute anemia due to the right gluteal hematoma, mechanical aortic valve, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium.

The patient's plan includes restarting heparin gtt and holding coumadin due to the ongoing bleeding, serial exams to evaluate for compartment syndrome, and transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to keep the Hb level above 21%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which can lead to compartment syndrome, nerve damage, and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
2. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, bleeding, or underlying kidney disease.
3. Increased risk of thrombotic events due to the mechanical aortic valve and the patient's anticoagulation status.
4. Progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy and potential cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Delirium can worsen or persist, potentially leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
6. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension can recur, potentially leading to cardiovascular instability.
7. The patient's acute renal failure may not resolve, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his bleeding, coagulation status, and underlying medical conditions to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was anticoagulated after orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma. He was admitted to the ICU with a hemoglobin drop of 27.3 to 23.3 overnight and was found to have a gluteal hematoma on abdominal CT scan. He received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was off heparin infusion since the afternoon of the previous day. His INR is 1.5, and his PTT is 29.5.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Right gluteal hematoma: The patient has a significant bleed into his hip, which is causing hypotension and orthostatic hypotension.
2. Acute anemia: The patient's hemoglobin drop is causing anemia, which may require further transfusions.
3. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, which requires anticoagulation. However, the patient is currently bleeding, and his heparin infusion has been held.
4. Hypotension/Orthostatic hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension and orthostatic hypotension due to the bleed into his hip.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a recent echo demonstrating an ejection fraction of 45%.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has improving renal function following a hypotensive episode earlier in his admission.
7. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be related to his medical condition and medications.
8. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which is currently being managed with medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which may lead to hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and acute anemia.
2. Development of compartment syndrome in the affected leg, which may require surgical intervention.
3. Further decline in renal function, which may require dialysis.
4. Worsening of ischemic cardiomyopathy, which may lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Progression of delirium, which may require further interventions to manage symptoms.
6. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's mechanical aortic valve and anticoagulation status.
7. Infection or sepsis, which may be related to the patient's medical condition and underlying health status.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p ORIF of right hip complicated by local bleeding in the
   setting of required anticoagulation for mechanical valve.  He has had
   HCT at 24 over past two days and with single value of 25.6 would be an
   outlier.  He did not have evidence of hemodynamic insult or change in
   pain at the site or function of the lower extermity and Ortho exam was
   reassuring.
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD
   BLEED)
   -Repeat HCT q 6 hours today
   -Will continue to monitor local exam for signs of worsening
   -Would utilize only significant bleeding and symptomatic changes to
   guide need to stop heparin.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   -1 unit yesterday
   -Repeat HCT this morning
 VALVE REPLACEMENT, AORTIC MECHANICAL (AVR)-
   -Will start heparin again today and continue given significant increase
   in risk for valve thrombus at this time and with quite good stability
   over past 24-36 hours.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   74 yo male s/p ORIF of right hip complicated by local bleeding in the
   setting of required anticoagulation for mechanical valve.  He has had
   HCT at 24 over past two days and with single value of 25.6 would be an
   outlier.  He did not have evidence of hemodynamic insult or change in
   pain at the site or function of the lower extermity and Ortho exam was
   reassuring.
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD
   BLEED)
   -Repeat HCT q 6 hours today
   -Will continue to monitor local exam for signs of worsening
   -Would utilize only significant bleeding and symptomatic changes to
   guide need to stop heparin.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   -1 unit yesterday
   -Repeat HCT this morning
 VALVE REPLACEMENT, AORTIC MECHANICAL (AVR)-
   -Will start heparin again today and continue given significant increase

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right hip, complicated by postoperative bleeding in the setting of required anticoagulation for a mechanical valve. The patient's hemoglobin level decreased from 25.6 g/dL to 23.6 g/dL, but there was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or change in pain at the site or function of the lower extremity.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/36 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 729 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 14.1
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mg/dL
* Sodium: 136 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mmol/L
* Chloride: 109 mmol/L
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is significant for a clear mechanical click and soft systolic murmur in the heart, as well as no evidence of compartment syndrome in the lower extremities.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Repeating hemoglobin levels every 6 hours
* Monitoring the local examination for signs of worsening bleeding
* Utilizing only significant bleeding and symptomatic changes to guide the need to stop heparin
* Continuing anticoagulation with heparin
* Restarting beta blockers
* Maintaining ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hemorrhage/hematoma: continued bleeding at the surgical site
* Anemia: further blood loss and decreased hemoglobin levels
* Valve thrombus: failure of the mechanical valve due to inadequate anticoagulation
* Renal failure: acute kidney injury due to hypotension and inadequate fluid management
* Heart failure: exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to inadequate beta blocker therapy
* Delirium/confusion: continued cognitive impairment due to inadequate pain management and sedation
* Infection: development of sepsis due to inadequate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and bled into his hip, resulting in a hematoma. He was anticoagulated with heparin post-op, but the bleeding continued, and he required transfusion of 3 units of PRBCs. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped from 27.3 to 23.3, and he was found to have a gluteal hematoma on abdominal CT. He was restarted on heparin gtt slowly, and his INR is currently 1.5. The patient's other medical conditions include acute anemia, mechanical aortic valve, hypotension/orthostatic hypotension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which could lead to further hemodynamic instability and potential compartment syndrome.
2. Development of acute renal failure due to inadequate perfusion of the kidneys, which could worsen the patient's current condition.
3. Progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension could worsen, leading to further cardiovascular instability.
5. Delirium could worsen, leading to increased risk of falls and other complications.
6. Potential for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's mechanical aortic valve and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Risk of sepsis due to the patient's compromised immune system and potential infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and transfuse PRBCs as needed to maintain a Hct of >24.
2. Restart heparin gtt slowly and continue to hold Coumadin until the bleeding issues stabilize.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes.
4. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with frequent reorientation, avoiding narcotics for pain, and using tramadol and Haldol as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, and consider dialysis if his creatinine levels continue to rise.
6. Consider the use of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE.
7. Continue to educate the patient and his family on his condition, treatment options, and potential complications."

   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT. Pt
   s/p total of 4U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. Currently INR 1.8, PTT 119 on
   heparin gtt.
   - Heparin gtt  turned down for inc PTT today. continuing to hold
   coumadin and awaiting ortho
s recs on when to restart it.
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery. Now stable at Hct ~26 on Heparin gtt.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt [**2128-7-31**] Hct has been stable at ~26 since.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stabilize. Will f/u
   with ortho re:their recs for this. If ok with them could start tonight
   if PTT normalized at next draw.
    #Fever: could be [**1-24**] line infection vs uti vs surgical site infection
   vs drug fever from keflex
   - Will D/C RIJ today once peripheral IV placed
   - Urine and blood cultures are pending
   -CXR with no change from [**2128-7-28**] with some suggestion of fluid overload
   but no apparent consolidations.
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Started back on BBlocker at low dose for HR control of Afib. [**Month (only) 60**]
   benefit more from Coreg given his cardiac history. Will defer for now
   as patient currently stable on low dose BBlocker.
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. SBPs now high 90s.
    Will restart patient
s home dose of spironolactone and consider
   re-adding his bumex as well if continues to be overloaded by exam.
   -Continue Statin
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 1.3.
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma.
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and developed a bleeding complication, resulting in a right gluteal hematoma. He was anticoagulated with heparin and had a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 27.3 to 23.3 overnight. He received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was restarted on heparin. The patient is currently being monitored for compartment syndrome, and his hemoglobin levels are being checked every 6 hours. He has also developed a fever, which may be related to a line infection, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, or drug fever from Keflex.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding into the right gluteal hematoma is a significant concern, and he may require further transfusions or surgical intervention to control the bleeding.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are currently stable at around 26, but he may require further transfusions to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to his tissues.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR) suggest that he may be at risk for bleeding complications, and he will need to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's fever may be related to a line infection, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, or drug fever from Keflex, and he will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been running in the 80's/60's, which may be related to his bleeding and anemia. He will need to be closely monitored for signs of hypotension and hypovolemic shock.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent echo demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45%, and he may be at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine level is currently 1.3, and he may be at risk for further renal deterioration if his bleeding is not controlled.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be related to his underlying medical condition, medications, or electrolyte imbalances, and he will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening delirium.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and he will need to be closely monitored and managed by the healthcare team to prevent or treat these complications."
