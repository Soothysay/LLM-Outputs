You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a history of seizure, hypertension, and unknown allergy to sulfonamides. The patient developed VTach overnight and was treated with amiodarone. They also had a fever of 101.8°F, rigors, and needed pressor support with neostigmine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of -1 mmHg, and their fluid balance is 2,896 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 20 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are normal, and their electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis. This can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VTach and treatment with amiodarone increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg is low, and the patient may be at risk for hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest compromised renal function. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 96% and ABG results suggest possible respiratory failure. This can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death.
6. Skin rash: The patient's skin rash may be a sign of an allergic reaction or infection. This can lead to further complications, including sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Neurological dysfunction: The patient's neurological examination is incomplete, and the patient may be at risk for neurological dysfunction, including seizures, stroke, and death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

 RASH
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probably VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - consider CVL if BP does not respond to fluids for pressors
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - abx with vanco/zosyn/clinda as discussed below
   .
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis.  Strange that it is [**Last Name (LF) 12001**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] could be a systemic
   bacteremia that is manifesting itself at the venopuncture sites.  No
   central lines or ports, but does have a PPM in place, although not
   recently manipulated.  No other skin tears or rashes that could be
   niduses of infection.  UA normal and CXR without infiltrate.  Abdominal
   exam benign but does have hx of chronic diarrhea.
   - vanco/zosyn for now
   - ID consults in AM
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Rash: unclear etiology, looks like sepsis but could be secondary to
   microvascular thrombotic events, chemotherapy reactions, latex allergic
   reactions or other unclear reasons.  Has been outlined.
   - abx as above
   - continue to follow clinically
   - consider derm if not improving
   .
   # Vtach: stable VTach overnight for about 10 minutes.
   - EP re-consult today
   - continue amio load
   - telemetrey, replace lytes as needed
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and was
   due for next dosing tomorrow.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, who was transferred to the MICU due to fevers, rash, and presumed sepsis. The patient's condition has been complicated by VTach, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.8°F (38.8°C)
* Heart rate: 76 bpm
* Blood pressure: 97/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 108 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 304 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Cardiac dysrhythmia
* Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
* Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)
* Rash

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IV fluids as needed with 250 cc boluses for MAP < 60
* Consideration of central venous catheter (CVL) if blood pressure does not respond to fluids and pressors
* Trending of lactates and CVPs in CVL placed
* Antibiotics with vancomycin, zosyn, and clinda
* ID consults in the morning
* Tylenol as needed
* Continued monitoring of the patient's clinical status

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Coagulopathy
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anemia
* Hypoglycemia

The patient's care plan should prioritize the management of his sepsis, cardiac dysrhythmias, and respiratory status, while also monitoring for potential complications."

   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probably VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - consider CVL if BP does not respond to fluids for pressors
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - abx with vanco/zosyn/clinda as discussed below
   .
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis.  Strange that it is [**Last Name (LF) 12001**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] could be a systemic
   bacteremia that is manifesting itself at the venopuncture sites.  No
   central lines or ports, but does have a PPM in place, although not
   recently manipulated.  No other skin tears or rashes that could be
   niduses of infection.  UA normal and CXR without infiltrate.  Abdominal
   exam benign but does have hx of chronic diarrhea.
   - vanco/zosyn for now
   - ID consults in AM
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Rash: unclear etiology, looks like sepsis but could be secondary to
   microvascular thrombotic events, chemotherapy reactions, latex allergic
   reactions or other unclear reasons.  Has been outlined.
   - abx as above
   - continue to follow clinically
   - consider derm if not improving
   .
   # Vtach: stable VTach overnight for about 10 minutes.
   - EP re-consult today
   - continue amio load
   - telemetrey, replace lytes as needed
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and was
   due for next dosing tomorrow.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aflutter, who was admitted to the ICU with a presumed sepsis, fever, and rash. The patient has undergone various treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulation, and has been placed on a cardiac rhythm monitor.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.8°F, heart rate 76 beats per minute, blood pressure 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation and aflutter, and is currently in normal sinus rhythm. He has a pacemaker in place for sick sinus syndrome.
* Respiratory: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a tracheostomy tube in place.
* Neurological: The patient is awake and responsive, but has not been assessed for movement, tone, or sensation.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.4 K/uL, and his platelet count is 112 K/uL. His lactate level is 2.9 mmol/L, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest a possible septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac dysrhythmia and his current condition can increase his risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may be at risk for respiratory failure or pneumonia.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unknown, and he may be at risk for neurological deterioration or seizures.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible kidney damage or failure.
* Hematological complications: The patient's low platelet count and elevated lactate level suggest possible bleeding or clotting disorders.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that the healthcare team:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Administer antibiotics and vasopressors as necessary to manage sepsis and hypotension.
* Consider the use of cardiac rhythm management strategies, such as cardioversion or anti-arrhythmic medications, to manage cardiac dysrhythmias.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider the use of respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation, if necessary.
* Assess the patient's neurological status and consider the use of neurological interventions, such as sedation or analgesia, if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and consider the use of renal replacement therapy if necessary.
* Consider the use of hemostatic agents, such as platelet transfusions or anticoagulation medications, to manage bleeding or clotting disorders."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (afib), and atrial flutter (aflutter), who presented with a probable VT arrest and was transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash, presumed sepsis. He has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far, with a decrease in his heart rate but a dropping blood pressure. He has a rash on his right dorsum of hand with erythematous patch and left antecubital with the same.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.1-12.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.1-38.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 108-112 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6-1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20-40 mg/dL
* Serum lactate: 2.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 304 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* CHF with an estimated ejection fraction of 25%
* Aflutter with a history of afib
* Sepsis with organ dysfunction
* Rash of unclear etiology
* Possible VT arrest or other cardiogenic cause
* Chronic diarrhea
* History of chemotherapy with Bevacizumab and Temsirolimus

The patient's medications include:

* Amiodarone for VTach
* Vancomycin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for sepsis
* Levothyroxine for hyperthyroidism
* Statin and gemfibrozil for hyperlipidemia
* SSRI, mirtazapine, and ambien for depression

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including VTach and possible VT arrest
* Respiratory failure due to CHF and possible pneumonia
* Renal failure due to sepsis and possible contrast nephropathy
* Hepatic failure due to sepsis and possible chemotherapy toxicity
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to sepsis and possible stress ulcer
* Thrombotic events due to sepsis and possible chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia

The patient's care plan includes:

* IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
* Trend lactates and CVPs
* Continue antibiotics with vanco/zosyn/clinda
* ID consult to discuss management
* F/U cultures and trend daily BCx
* Consider TTE and TEE for possible vegetation
* Hold chemotherapy due to infection
* Hold anticoagulation due to possible need for procedure
* Continue to monitor respiratory status and avoid diuresis at this time
* Continue to follow clinically and consider dermatology consult if rash does not improve."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reevaluate echo from two days ago for possible beg
   - EP recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.  TEE negative for involvement of heart of PPM
   leads.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of spine hardware,
   PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - d/c vancomycin/zosyn and start nafcillin
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   - ID consult to discuss management
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - Start PO amiodarone
   - consider PO metoprolol in future if pressures can tolerate
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reevaluate echo from two days ago for possible beg
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   #Rash:  Hand cellulitis improving, monitor clinically
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - Touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of oncology/onc fellow re: next cycle of
   chemo (due today)
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.
   .
   # Hyperthryroidism: cont levothyroxine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin and gemfibrizol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Was febrile to 104 most of day
   today.  Has received 1750 cc of fluid total so far with a decrease in
   his HR but BP dropping.  TEE negative for involvement of heart of PPM
   leads.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of spine hardware,
   PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - d/c vancomycin/zosyn and start nafcillin
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   - ID consult to discuss management
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - Start PO amiodarone
   - consider PO metoprolol in future if pressures can tolerate
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reevaluate echo from two days ago for possible beg
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   #Rash:  Hand cellulitis improving, monitor clinically
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo today.  Has new O2 requirement
   after being given IVFs.  Is stable with his breathing, though, no
   admission to the ICU.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - Touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of oncology/onc fellow re: next cycle of
   chemo (due today)
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, who presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with probable ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest, fevers, and rash. He has been treated with antibiotics and has undergone various diagnostic tests, including echocardiogram and blood cultures. The patient has been experiencing episodes of sustained VT, and his blood pressure has been fluctuating. He has also been treated with lidocaine and esmolol to control his heart rate and blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest that he may have sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's episodes of sustained VT are a concern, as they can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and his current symptoms, such as shortness of breath and swelling, suggest that he may be experiencing heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's rash and cellulitis suggest that he may have an infection, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
5. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, as well as his current symptoms, suggest that he may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, which may be a sign of hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Hyperthyroidism: The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and his current symptoms, such as tremors and anxiety, suggest that he may be experiencing hyperthyroidism, which needs to be treated promptly.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and his current symptoms, such as high cholesterol levels, suggest that he may be at risk for cardiovascular complications.
9. Depression: The patient's history of depression and his current symptoms, such as fatigue and decreased appetite, suggest that he may be experiencing depression, which needs to be treated promptly.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and consider adding anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Consider performing an echocardiogram to assess the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential cardiac complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adding antihypertensive medication to reduce the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential cardiac complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adding electrolyte supplements to reduce the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Consider performing a thyroid function test to assess the patient's thyroid function and identify any potential thyroid-related complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's lipid levels and consider adding lipid-lowering medication to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.
9. Consider performing a depression screening to assess the patient's mental health and identify any potential depression-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour event, with a Vtach episode lasting 10 minutes overnight. The patient was previously on pressors but was taken off and then became hypertensive, with SBPs in the 190-210 range. Lidocaine was administered at 2mg/min, titrated down, and then stopped. The patient was also ordered to receive an esmolol drip, but it was not implemented.

The patient has a history of allergies, including sulfonamides, Wellbutrin, and unknown substances. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, including Piperacillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.4°C (101.2°F) and 35.6°C (96°F) over the past 24 hours
* Heart rate: 71 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 68-166 bpm
* Blood pressure: 125/69 mmHg with a range of 77/43-209/104 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a range of 15-30 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: V-paced

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 108,000/μL
* White blood cell count: 7.1 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 20 mg/dL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Sodium: 132 mEq/L
* Chloride: 104 mEq/L

The patient's physical examination is limited due to lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as Vtach, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and decreased cardiac output
* Hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke
* Respiratory compromise, given the patient's requirement for oxygen therapy and the presence of VAP
* Sepsis, given the patient's history of antibiotic use and the presence of fever
* Acute kidney injury, given the patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels
* Electrolyte imbalances, given the patient's abnormal potassium, sodium, and chloride levels
* Nutritional deficiencies, given the patient's requirement for glycemic control and the presence of hyperglycemia."

   TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
   mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
   inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
   pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or perivavlar
   abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer leads. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to
   mid wall hypokinesis. Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the
   anterior wall motion looks normal and the inferior wall is less
   hypokinetic.
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Afebrile now for 36 hours on
   vancomycin/zosyn/nafcillin. Now normotensive and off of pressors.  TEE
   negative for involvement of heart of PPM leads.  If persistently
   febrile consider involvement of spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue
   infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - continue vancomycin/nafcillin; consider d/c zosyn
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - continue PO amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 **] for one week then reduce to
   maintenance
   - continue PO metoprolol and titrate up as blood pressure tolerates
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reassuring TEE from [**2106-4-14**].
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   # Cellulitis: Clinical improvement on the left but still with swelling,
   erythema on the right.  Clinically neurovascularly intact without
   obvious fluid collection, joints non-tender without evidence of septic
   arthritis.
   - U/S to evaluate for fluid collection on Right
   - consult hand surgery
   .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Reduction in platelet count in setting of
   subcutaneous heparin concerning for HIT.
   - hold subQ heparin
   - send HIT antibody
   .
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo.  No evidence of fluid
   overload or acute CHF.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - will hold on chemotherapy until patient stable (based upon outpatient
   oncology recommendations).
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.
   .
   # Hyperthryroidism: cont levothyroxine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cont statin and gemfibrizol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANS ESOPHAGEAL ECHO - At [**2106-4-14**] 10:45 AM
   Had episodes of hypotension in early AM, but then became hypertensive
   to SBPs in 200s later in the morning. Started on esmolol drip and
   weaned off after < 2 hours. Underwent TEE which showed no vegetations
   on valves or pacer wires. Changed to PO amiodarone after 24 hour drip
   complete. Low-dose BB started in evening after stable pressures, heart
   rate throughout afternoon per EP recs. Thrombocytopenia worsening to >
   100 -> 74 -> 66 so SQ heparin stopped. Email from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and aflutter, who presented with probable VT arrest and was transferred to the MICU for fevers, rash, and presumed sepsis. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by episodes of sustained VT, and he has been treated with antibiotics, anticoagulation, and anti-arrhythmic medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.4°C, HR 92 bpm, BP 104/49 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 93%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery
* Cardiovascular: Mild mitral regurgitation, mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to mid wall hypokinesis
* Neurological: Afebrile, normotensive, and off pressors
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 7.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 30.3%
	+ Plt: 66 K/uL
	+ Cr: 1.4 mg/dL
	+ TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
	+ Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
	+ LDH: 360 IU/L
	+ Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 1.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile response may persist, and further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of VT arrest and sustained VT episodes may indicate a risk for recurrent VT, which requires close monitoring and further evaluation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia and to consider treatment options.
4. Cellulitis: The patient's rash and swelling may indicate a deeper infection, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the infection and to consider treatment options.
5. Heart failure: The patient's history of CHF and mild mitral regurgitation may indicate a risk for further decompensation, which requires close monitoring and further evaluation.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hyperglycemia and to consider treatment options.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of CHF and atrial fibrillation may indicate a risk for thromboembolic events, which requires close monitoring and further evaluation.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as directed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's infection, including imaging studies and cultures.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status, including ECG and echocardiogram.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's thrombocytopenia, including platelet aggregation studies.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and consider treatment options for hyperglycemia.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's risk for thromboembolic events, including anticoagulation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a heart rhythm of ventricular paced, and a blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg. The patient's temperature is 37.4°C, heart rate is 92 bpm, and respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 30.3%, and platelet count of 66 K/uL, indicating worsening thrombocytopenia. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 45 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 24 IU/L.

The patient's cardiac enzymes show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, and chloride level of 107 mEq/L.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including esmolol, amiodarone, and low-dose beta blockers, as well as antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam and nafcillin. The patient has also been receiving prophylactic heparin and has been monitored for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's medical history is significant for cardiac arrhythmia, and the patient has undergone a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with no vegetations on valves or pacer wires.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmia and the use of medications such as amiodarone and beta blockers to control the arrhythmia may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's worsening thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the use of antibiotics may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac damage: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac damage, which could lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could lead to complications such as jaundice or coagulopathy.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level may indicate renal dysfunction, which could lead to complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)."

   TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
   mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
   inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
   pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or perivavlar
   abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer leads. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to
   mid wall hypokinesis.
   Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the anterior wall motion
   looks normal and the inferior wall is less hypokinetic.
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Afebrile now for 36 hours on
   vancomycin/zosyn/nafcillin. Now normotensive and off of pressors.  TEE
   negative for involvement of heart of PPM leads.  If persistently
   febrile consider involvement of spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue
   infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - continue vancomycin/nafcillin; consider d/c zosyn
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - Start PO amiodarone
   - continue PO metoprolol and titrate up as blood pressure tolerates
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reassuring TEE from [**2106-4-14**].
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   #Rash:  Hand cellulitis improving, monitor clinically
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo.  No evidence of fluid
   overload or acute CHF.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - will hold on chemotherapy until patient stable (based upon outpatient
   oncology recommendations).
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
   mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
   inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations
   are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
   pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Good quality study. No valvular vegetations or perivavlar
   abcesses seen. No vegetations seen on RA/RV pacer leads. Mild mitral
   regurgitation. Mild focal left ventricular dysfunction with basal to
   mid wall hypokinesis.
   Compared to the transthoracic echo of [**4-12**]/9, the anterior wall motion
   looks normal and the inferior wall is less hypokinetic.
   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with hx of CHF, afib, aflutter, s/p PPM for SSS, RCC on chemo
   with Bevacizumab / Temsirolimus who presented with probable VT arrest
   who is transferred to the MICU for fevers and rash and presumed sepsis
   with hospital course complicated by episodes of sustained VT.
   .
   # Sepsis: patient transferred with fevers, tachycardia and hypotension,
   likely sepsis from a cellulitis.  Afebrile now for 36 hours on
   vancomycin/zosyn/nafcillin. Now normotensive and off of pressors.  TEE
   negative for involvement of heart of PPM leads.  If persistently
   febrile consider involvement of spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue
   infection in hand.
   - IVFs PRN with 250 cc boluses for MAP <60
   - trend lactates, CVPs in CVL placed
   - continue vancomycin/nafcillin; consider d/c zosyn
   - F/U results of daily cultures
   # Vtach:  Patient with intermittent episodes of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia, hemodynamically stable
   - monitor on telemetry
   - F/U EP recs
   - Start PO amiodarone
   - continue PO metoprolol and titrate up as blood pressure tolerates
   - keep chest pads in place in case of recurrence
   # Fevers: most obvious cause is the new rash which is likely
   cellulitis. [**4-12**] blood cultures growing MSSA.  Strange that it is
   bilateral, so could be a systemic bacteremia that is manifesting itself
   at the venopuncture sites.  No central lines or ports, but does have a
   PPM in place, although not recently manipulated.  UA normal and CXR
   without infiltrate.  If persistently febrile consider involvement of
   spine hardware, PPM, deep tissue infection in hand.
   - change antibiotics as above
   - F/U ID recs
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Syncope: unclear etiology, but ? VT arrest vs. other cardiogenic
   cause.  Did have an echo today and was going to go to an EP study, but
   deferred because of infection.
   - reassuring TEE from [**2106-4-14**].
   - EP recs
   - consider study when stable
   - avoid pressors with B1 agonist if possible
   .
   #Rash:  Hand cellulitis improving, monitor clinically
   # CHF: has EF of about 25% based on echo.  No evidence of fluid
   overload or acute CHF.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - avoid diuresis at this time
   .
   # RCC: is stable per old onc recs; currently under treatment and due
   for next dosing today.
   - hold on chemo given infection
   - will hold on chemotherapy until patient stable (based upon outpatient
   oncology recommendations).
   .
   # Afib/flutter: has hx of aflutter and was anticoagulated.  Stable in
   NSR at this time.  Has pacer for sick sinus syndrome.
   - hold anticoagulation at this time given possible need for procedure
   .
   # HTN: hypotensive given sepsis.
   - hold antihypertensive.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation, and aflutter, who was transferred to the ICU for fevers, rash, and presumed sepsis. He has been treated with antibiotics, and his fever has been controlled. He has had episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, but is currently hemodynamically stable. He also has a rash on his hand, which is likely cellulitis. His cardiac function is mildly impaired, with an estimated ejection fraction of 25%. He has a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome and is currently not anticoagulated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying condition and the presence of a central line. He should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can be a life-threatening condition. He should be closely monitored for any signs of VT, and antipyretics should be used to control fever.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has a rash on his hand, which is likely cellulitis. He should be closely monitored for signs of cellulitis, such as increased redness, swelling, and pain. He should also receive antibiotic therapy to treat the infection.
4. Cardiac Impairment: The patient has mild cardiac impairment, with an estimated ejection fraction of 25%. He should be closely monitored for signs of cardiac decompensation, such as increased JVP, peripheral edema, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Anticoagulation: The patient is not currently anticoagulated, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation and aflutter. He should be closely monitored for signs of thrombosis, and anticoagulation therapy should be considered if necessary.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line, which increases his risk of infection. He should be closely monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and redness at the insertion site. He should also receive antibiotic therapy to treat any suspected infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for the treatment of sepsis and cellulitis.
2. Monitor the patient closely for signs of sepsis, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac decompensation.
3. Consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary to prevent thrombosis.
4. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and provide antibiotic therapy if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Consider performing a transesophageal echocardiogram to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function."
