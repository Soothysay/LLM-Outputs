   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patinet was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.
   - ASA 325mg
   - begin metoprolol 100mg TID, and titrate as tolerated
   - start 5 mg lisinopril in am if BP improves
   - while no role for revascularization following infarcted myocardium 3
   days prior, would imagine likely cardiac catherization to evaluate for
   degree of CAD.
   - will discuss with ortho ability to start plavix in conservative
   mangement of STEMI
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated
   - TTE to evaluate for post-infarction complications
   - IV lasix
   - CXR to evaluate lung fields.
   - start ACE in am if BP allows
   - cont metoprolol
   - rate control as given below
   - possible repeat TTE on [**Year (4 digits) **]

   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed on [**Year (4 digits) 4140**], dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.  Currently in
   AF, and started on heparin gtt.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated.
   - uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated for rate control
   - continue [**Last Name (LF) 4140**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to give IV load if unable to rate
   control
   - continue heparin gtt
   - if remains in AF by [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] c/s EP for possible cardioversion.
   As heparin started at time of onset, no need for TEE.
   - if HR remains stable w/o pauses, will d/c transvenous pacer in am

   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  Incomplete work-up at NEBH.

   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patinet on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP not w/ pronouced output.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department after undergoing spinal surgery and experiencing a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) following surgery. He has a history of CAD and prior MI. The patient's troponin levels peaked at 72, and he was treated conservatively without anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding in the post-operative period. He was started on heparin gtt after developing new AF (atrial fibrillation).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Tachypnea and diaphoresis
* Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg
* Distended neck veins
* Crackles at the bases of the lungs
* Decreased bowel sounds
* Mildly tense and distended abdomen

   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing spinal surgery. He developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), and ileus.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 21.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.7%
* Platelet count: 251 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.21 ng/mL
* Glucose: 142 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Amiodarone IV bolus and infusion
* Lopressor for heart rate control
* Lasix IV and oral for fluid management
* Omeprazole (Prilosec) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management
* Heparin sodium IV infusion for anticoagulation

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Well-developed male, comfortable and in no acute distress
* Head and neck: Normal cranial nerves, sclera anicteric
* Cardiac: Point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Lungs: Bibasilar crackles
* Abdomen: Soft, mildly tense, and distended, with decreased bowel sounds
* Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Back: Intact dressing without drainage, with a JP drain in place with blood in the bulb

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Coronaries: Continue anticoagulation with heparin, consider catheterization on Monday, and consider ACE inhibitor when tolerated by blood pressure
* Pump: Continue Lasix infusion with Diovan to maintain urine output > 100 mL/hour, daily chest X-ray, and consider ACE inhibitor when tolerated by blood pressure
* Rhythm: Continue amiodarone, give second 150-mg IV bolus, and consider electrical cardioversion
* Leukocytosis: Hold antibiotics until the patient spikes a fever or shows evidence of infection, follow up on urine cultures, and encourage isolation
* Anemia: Monitor serial hematocrit levels, consider surgical bleed, and evaluate for bleeding
* Constipation: Continue bowel regimen, including colace, senna, lactulose, and soap suds enema
* Spinal surgery: Orthopedic evaluation for post-operative needs

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening pulmonary edema
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
* Acute kidney injury
* Ileus
* Constipation
* Bleeding
* Infection
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) post-operatively. He was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department and has been receiving treatment for atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and ileus. The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, and acute kidney injury. He has been receiving various medications, including heparin, lasix, diltiazem, and amiodarone, and has undergone cardioversion attempts.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is likely to worsen due to his atrial fibrillation, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen due to his atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output, which can lead to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus may persist or worsen due to his post-operative state, medication side effects, and lack of bowel movement.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and lack of clear infection may indicate the development of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's heparin therapy and post-operative state may increase his risk of bleeding complications, including hematoma formation and hemorrhage.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and STEMI may increase his risk of cardiac complications, including ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and heart failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure may worsen due to his atrial fibrillation, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.

Recommendations:

1. Continue cardioversion attempts to convert the patient's atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.
2. Monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and acute kidney injury closely and adjust his fluid management and diuretic therapy accordingly.
3. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if his fever and leukocytosis persist or worsen.
4. Monitor the patient's bowel movement and adjust his bowel regimen accordingly to prevent further ileus.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his heparin therapy and other medications accordingly.
6. Consider adding a vasopressor to the patient's regimen to support his blood pressure and cardiac output.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and function closely and adjust his medication regimen accordingly to prevent further cardiac complications."

   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 97-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation (AF) and underwent cardioversion, which was unsuccessful. He was started on diltiazem and amiodarone infusions, and his heart rate remains in the 80-90s with systolic blood pressures above 100 mmHg.

The patient's temperature has spiked to 100.4°F (38.1°C) twice, once in the afternoon and again in the evening, and he is being treated with Tylenol. He has been diagnosed with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), spinal soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis, and is receiving antibiotics. A chest X-ray showed mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and small right pleural effusion, which has resolved.

The patient has abdominal distension and is likely experiencing prolonged postoperative ileus. He received two water enemas without effect and was given lactulose. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and 800cc of fluid was removed. Enemas and lactulose were discontinued.

The patient's code status is full code, and his vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 80-90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 114/52 mmHg (93/35 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 93%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AF with HR in 80-90s

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 21.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.7%
* Platelet count: 251 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.21 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* LDH: 826 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's suspected HCAP and/or spinal soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis
* Heart failure exacerbation due to the patient's acute systolic heart failure
* Pneumonia complications, such as respiratory failure or septic shock
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, due to the patient's prolonged postoperative ileus
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, due to the patient's altered glucose metabolism
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Skin integrity issues, such as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, due to the patient's prolonged immobility and altered skin integrity."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require non-rebreather oxygen therapy, and his oxygen saturation is only 92-95%. This may indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may be indicative of an underlying infection. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and soft tissue/osteomyelitis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, MI, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in atrial fibrillation and has a slow ventricular response. This may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of postoperative ileus and has not had a bowel movement since admission. This may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
5. Hematological complications: The patient has anemia, which may be related to blood loss during surgery or ongoing bleeding. This may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematoma.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of spinal surgery and may be at risk for neurological complications, such as spinal cord compression, radiculopathy, or peripheral neuropathy.
7. Infection: The patient has a central line in place and is at risk for line-related infections. He also has a urinary catheter and may be at risk for urinary tract infections.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy and is at risk for bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematoma.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
10. Metabolic complications: The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalances and may be at risk for metabolic complications, such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and address any potential complications promptly to prevent worsening of his condition."

   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs

   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/
   Tylenol and rare morphine prn.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI post-operatively. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and ileus. He requires non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has been receiving diuresis with Lasix and chlorothiazide. His abdominal distension and ileus have led to a prolonged post-operative ileus, and he has required multiple enemas and laxatives to manage bowel movements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's continued requirement for non-rebreather oxygen therapy and his worsening pulmonary edema pose a risk of hypoxia, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Ileus: The patient's prolonged post-operative ileus may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
5. Infection: The patient's recent spinal surgery and indwelling catheters pose a risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent STEMI pose a risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The plan includes:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix and chlorothiazide to manage pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent thrombotic complications.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed to prevent atrial fibrillation and cardiac complications.
5. Manage the patient's bowel regimen to prevent further complications related to ileus.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed to prevent acute kidney injury.
7. Consider imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, to evaluate the patient's spinal surgery site and rule out infection or other complications.
8. Consider weaning the patient off non-rebreather oxygen therapy if tolerated.
9. Consider intubation if the patient's hypoxia worsens or if there is a risk of respiratory failure.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, give improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, give improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require non-rebreather oxygen therapy, and his oxygen saturation is only 92-95%. This suggests that he may not be adequately oxygenating his tissues, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has failed cardioversion and is still in AFib, which can lead to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has had a myocardial infarction (MI). He is also experiencing heart failure, which can worsen his overall condition and increase the risk of further complications.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has mild pulmonary edema, which can worsen his oxygenation and increase his risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient has a fever and is receiving antibiotics for possible HCAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) and/or soft tissue infection/osteomyelitis. He also has a white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.6, which is elevated, suggesting an active infection.
6. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in days and has distended abdomen, which can lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction and perforation.
7. Abdominal Distension: The patient has abdominal distension, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of respiratory failure.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has marked leukocytosis, which can be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation.
9. Anemia: The patient has a pronounced Hct drop, which can be due to bleeding or blood loss.
10. Spinal Surgery Complications: The patient had spinal surgery, and there is a risk of complications such as infection, bleeding, and nerve damage.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/
   Tylenol and rare morphine prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/
   Tylenol and rare morphine prn.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed atrial fibrillation (AF) post-operatively. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and ileus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C), heart rate of 80-90 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 114/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is on non-rebreather mask.

The patient's cardiac status is of concern, with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prior myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's troponin levels peaked at 72, and he is currently on heparin and aspirin. The patient's echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% with apical and septal hypokinesis.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with persistent hypoxia despite diuresis and oxygen therapy. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and right pleural effusion, which has resolved. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 37 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 115 mmHg.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is also concerning, with ileus and abdominal distension. The patient's bowel sounds are decreased, and he has not had a bowel movement in days. The patient is receiving lactulose and senna to promote bowel regularity.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 21.6 x 10^9/L. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is 1.5 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the coronary care unit (CCU).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure (ARF)
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock
3. Progression of ileus and bowel obstruction
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to heparin therapy
5. Development of atrial fibrillation (AF) or other arrhythmias
6. Worsening of cardiac function and potential for cardiac arrest
7. Development of anemia or bleeding due to surgical trauma or heparin therapy
8. Infection or sepsis related to spinal surgery or other invasive procedures
9. Development of bowel perforation or peritonitis
10. Worsening of renal function and potential for acute kidney injury (AKI)

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, cardiac status, and respiratory function closely. The patient's code status should be readdressed with the patient and family, and his disposition should be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who underwent spinal surgery and developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, ARF, and ileus.
* He is currently in the ICU with a code status of full code.
* His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C), heart rate of 80-90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 114/52 mmHg.
* He has a distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds and is receiving IV fluids, Lasix, and diltiazem.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to embolization of clots, which can cause stroke or systemic embolization.
	* The patient's history of CAD and MI increases the risk of cardiac complications.
2. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
	* The patient's decreased lung compliance and bilateral crackles on lung exam increase the risk of respiratory complications.
3. **Renal Complications:**
	* ARF may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
	* The patient's history of CAD and MI increases the risk of renal complications.
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Ileus may persist, leading to bowel obstruction or perforation.
	* The patient's distended abdomen and decreased bowel sounds increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
5. **Infection Complications:**
	* The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection.
	* The patient's history of spinal surgery and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection.
6. **Thrombotic Complications:**
	* The patient's history of CAD and MI increases the risk of thrombotic complications.
	* The patient's use of heparin and Lasix may increase the risk of bleeding.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
* Administer Lasix and diltiazem as ordered to manage pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation.
* Consider ACE inhibitor therapy when the patient's blood pressure is stable.
* Continue to monitor the patient's bowel movements and consider colonoscopy if the patient's ileus persists.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.

   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) post-operatively. He has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and multiple PCIs (percutaneous coronary interventions) with 2 stents placed.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Hypoxia: Despite being on oxygen therapy, the patient's SpO2 remains at 96%. The differential diagnosis includes CHF (congestive heart failure), PNA (pneumonia), and PE (pulmonary embolism).
2. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F) and is being treated with antibiotics. The source of the fever is unclear, but possible causes include PNA, UTI (urinary tract infection), soft tissue/osteo infections, and post-op stress response.
3. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient developed atrial fibrillation (AF) post-MI, which is being managed with diltiazem and heparin.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and right pleural effusion, which is being managed with diuresis and oxygen therapy.
5. Abdominal distension: The patient has a distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, which may be contributing to his hypoxia.
6. Anemia: The patient has a pronounced Hct (hematocrit) drop, which may be due to IVF (intravenous fluids) or surgical bleed.
7. Post-op ileus: The patient has had no bowel movements since admission and is being managed with aggressive bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he may develop further cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and respiratory distress.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and respiratory failure may be due to an underlying infection, which may spread to other areas of the body.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's post-op ileus may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further bleeding complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt to manage hypoxia and pulmonary edema.
2. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy to manage fever and potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider further interventions to manage atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure.
4. Continue aggressive bowel regimen to manage post-op ileus and prevent further complications.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further interventions to manage bleeding complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further interventions to manage respiratory failure."

   68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from NEBH after a
   STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib with
   continued hypoxia.
   24 Hour Events:
   The lasix gtt was decreased to 5 mg/hr with a goal of 50-70 cc UOP/hr
   (1.5 L/ 24 h neg).  BNP was added onto his admission labs and was
   15,279.  His cordis was pulled.  His dilt gtt was decreased from 7.5 to
   5 given some low SBPs, rate remained controlled initally, however his
   HR started to creep up so it was increased back to 7.5 .  He was
   okay'ed by orhto from [**Hospital **] hospital (where he had his recent
   surgery) to get OOB.   Lower extrem US were checked given his continued
   hypoxia and were negative for DVT.  Plan is for cath on Wednesday -
   will need to have acetylcysteine written for t/m.  The patient spiked
   fevers throughout the day and was cultured.  Will need to call ortho
   here t/m am to have them come and evaluate his back as a possible
   source of infection.  His dilt drip was increased to 10 to 12.5 to
   15 as his HR began increasing to the 100s -110s.  He remained
   persistently febrile on tylenol (tmax 102.0) so his tachycardia may be
   due to his fever.  The patient had liquid brown stool this am.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has a persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and continues to require non-rebreather oxygenation. The patient has a significant amount of fluid removal via diuresis, but his oxygenation has not improved significantly, with a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI and multiple PCIs, and has a current diagnosis of CHF, ARF, and ileus. He is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) and has a high risk of bleeding due to his recent spinal surgery.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial damage, and his creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a fever, which may be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or a soft tissue infection.

The patient's physical examination is significant for bilateral crackles in the lung fields, soft and distended abdomen, and decreased bowel sounds. His skin is warm and dry, and his extremities are cool.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix gtt to maintain urine output > 100/hour.
2. Continue antibiotic coverage for HCAP and possible soft tissue infection.
3. Consider weaning off non-rebreather oxygenation today if tolerated.
4. Low threshold for intubation if the patient becomes tachypneic (> 30) and hypoxemic.
5. Monitor WBC and fever curve, and provide tylenol prn for fevers.
6. Discuss pulling the central line with the attending physician, and if so, will pull and culture.
7. Continue Diltiazem gtt to control heart rate and improve filling.
8. Consider ACE inhibitor when tolerated by blood pressure.
9. Continue heparin gtt to prevent thrombosis.
10. Consider catheterization today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Sepsis
4. Cardiac tamponade
5. Hypovolemic shock
6. Respiratory failure
7. Renal failure
8. Infection of the spine or surgical site
9. Bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
10. Cardiac arrhythmias

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   3. Layering sludge within the gallbladder.
   4. Calcified pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (STEMI) following spinal surgery. The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and ileus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/91 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (19.2 K/uL) and troponin-T (2.21 ng/mL) levels, indicating possible infection or cardiac injury. His chest computed tomography (CT) scan shows mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and small left pleural effusion.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continue antibiotics to cover atypical pathogens, and consider narrowing the spectrum of antibiotics based on culture results.
2. Continue diuresis with Lasix and diuril as necessary to manage pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust medication as needed to control atrial fibrillation and prevent cardiac complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's bowel function and adjust the bowel regimen as needed to manage postoperative ileus.
5. Consider performing a cardiac catheterization to assess the patient's coronary arteries and rule out any cardiac complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral atelectasis on chest CT, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of STEMI and atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, ventricular septal defect, or cardiac rupture.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels suggest possible infection or cardiac injury, which may lead to sepsis or cardiac complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of postoperative ileus and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions on chest CT increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt

   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so

   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, MI, and multiple PCIs. He underwent spinal surgery and developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and ileus. The patient is currently being treated with diuresis, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and respiratory failure may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest CT scan shows mild pulmonary edema, which can worsen if not managed properly.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to embolic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, if not adequately anticoagulated.
4. Ileus: The patient's ileus may persist, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient's recent spinal surgery and hardware placement make him susceptible to post-operative infections, such as surgical site infections, endocarditis, or spinal abscesses.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and MI make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory arrest.
8. Renal failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and diuresis may lead to renal failure if not managed properly.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ileus and distended abdomen make him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
10. Central nervous system complications: The patient's spinal surgery and recent events may lead to central nervous system complications, such as spinal cord compression, epidural hematoma, or meningitis.

To prevent or manage these potential complications, the patient should continue to receive diuresis, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy as ordered. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and he should be kept nil per os (NPO) until further notice. The patient's cardiac status should also be closely monitored, and he should be anticoagulated as ordered. The patient's ileus should be managed with aggressive bowel regimen, and his spinal surgery should be closely monitored for signs of infection."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o
   MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they were less
   concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl, no
   replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, or change in his back pain.  Had
   two loose bowel movements yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) post-operatively.
* He is currently in the ICU with a course complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure (ARF), ileus, and continued hypoxemia.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm and blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg.
* He has small bilateral pulmonary effusions and atelectasis on chest CT, which may be contributing to his hypoxemia.
* The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 19.2, but he is afebrile and does not have signs of pneumonia.
* He has been treated with antibiotics, and cultures are pending.
* The patient's cardiac status is stable, with no signs of LV wall rupture or VSD.
* He is currently in atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with heparin and diltiazem.
* The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.
* He has a history of CAD and MI, and his ejection fraction is 40% with apical and septal hypokinesis.
* The patient's anemia is being monitored, and he is receiving IV fluids.
* He has a post-operative ileus, which is being managed with bowel regimen and advancement of diet.
* The patient has no restrictions regarding his spinal surgery, and he is being monitored for post-operative infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: despite the patient being afebrile and not having signs of pneumonia on chest CT, the elevated white blood cell count and presence of atelectasis may indicate a risk for pneumonia.
* Sepsis: the patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of pulmonary effusions may indicate a risk for sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current status in atrial fibrillation may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's hypoxemia and atelectasis may increase the risk for respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: the patient's history of CAD and MI, and current status with ARF, may increase the risk for renal failure.
* Bleeding: the patient's history of heparin use and current status with anemia may increase the risk for bleeding.
* Infection: the patient's history of spinal surgery and current status with elevated white blood cell count may increase the risk for infection."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Discussed with Dow, he may
   undergo cardioversion on cath lab tomorrow, pt is NPO.  Infectious w/up
   w/ negative influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and
   catheter tip Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior
   to cath.  O2 weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho
   felt ok w/o MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they
   were less concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl,
   no replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Discussed with Dow, he may
   undergo cardioversion on cath lab tomorrow, pt is NPO.  Infectious w/up
   w/ negative influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and
   catheter tip Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior
   to cath.  O2 weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho
   felt ok w/o MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they
   were less concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl,
   no replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who

   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) post-operatively. He was transferred to the ICU for management of pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and ileus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a range of 110-134 mmHg. His heart rate is 86-150 beats per minute, with a current rhythm of atrial fibrillation.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 93%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and MI (myocardial infarction), and is currently in atrial fibrillation. He has undergone cardioversion, but it was unsuccessful.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has post-operative ileus, with a distended abdomen and no bowel movements. He has been started on a bowel regimen and is tolerating it well.
* Spinal: The patient underwent spinal surgery and has no signs of infection or post-operative complications.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 19.2 K/uL, Hct 30.9%, Plt 459 K/uL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 133 mEq/L, K 3.5 mEq/L, Cl 95 mEq/L
* Liver enzymes: ALT 27 IU/L, AST 26 IU/L
* Troponin-T: 2.21 ng/mL
* Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* LDH: 826 IU/L

The patient's medications are as follows:

* Antibiotics: Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin
* Cardiovascular medications: ASA, Plavix, and Heparin
* Diuretics: Lasix and Diuril
* Anti-arrhythmic medications: Diltiazem and Metoprolol
* Pain management: IV morphine and Tylenol
* Bowel regimen: Colace, senna, and lactulose

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may not be controlled, leading to embolic complications.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress, leading to renal failure.
* Ileus: The patient's post-operative ileus may persist, leading to malnutrition and dehydration.
* Infection: The patient may develop a surgical site infection or a hospital-acquired infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and MI may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further evaluation and management of his condition will be necessary to ensure his safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o
   MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they were less
   concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl, no
   replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, or change in his back pain.  Had
   two loose bowel movements yesterday.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department (ED) after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), ileus, and hypoxemia. He has been treated with diuresis, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 37.3°C, HR = 86 bpm, BP = 116/59 mmHg, RR = 23 breaths/min, SpO2 = 93%
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, with a heart rate of 140s, managed initially with amiodarone, diltiazem gtt, and metoprolol
* Pulmonary: Mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions on chest CT
* Renal: ARF, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, possibly due to prerenal, ATN, or AIN
* Gastrointestinal: Ileus, with two loose bowel movements overnight
* Hematological: Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, possibly due to IVF
* Neurological: No clear signs of neurological dysfunction

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to embolization, stroke, or cardiac arrest
	* Cardiac tamponade or ventricular septal defect may occur due to post-MI ventricular dysfunction
2. Pulmonary complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure may develop due to atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or hypoxemia
	* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis may occur due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis may worsen ARF
	* Chronic kidney disease may develop due to prolonged ARF
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Ileus may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or hemorrhage
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation may occur due to anticoagulation therapy
5. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or bone marrow suppression
	* Thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur due to anticoagulation therapy or sepsis
6. Neurological complications:
	* Cerebral edema or hemorrhage may occur due to hypoxemia or sepsis
	* Seizures or encephalopathy may develop due to electrolyte imbalance or medication toxicity

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, and neurological status
2. Adjust medication therapy as necessary to manage atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus, and anemia
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent venous thromboembolism
4. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as echocardiography, to assess cardiac function and rule out cardiac tamponade or ventricular septal defect
5. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as chest pain, dyspnea, or arrhythmias
6. Monitor for signs of pulmonary complications, such as cough, fever, or worsening hypoxemia
7. Monitor for signs of renal complications, such as increasing creatinine levels or oliguria
8. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications, such as abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting
9. Monitor for signs of hematological complications, such as bleeding or bruising
10. Monitor for signs of neurological complications, such as altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits"

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   Cath yesterday showed high grade mid-LAD 90% lesion with thrombus, got
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarb prior to
   procedure, Creat post-procedure was 2.6.
   At 10pm, HR increased to 100s, 110s.  Was given
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has ongoing hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and pulmonary edema. He was treated with catheterization, stenting, and anticoagulation. He has been experiencing tachycardia, which was managed with diltiazem and metoprolol. He has also been experiencing hypoxia, which was managed with oxygen therapy and diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to 2.4, indicating ARF. The cause is unclear, but it may be related to hypotension during tachycardia, prerenal failure, or postrenal failure.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has ongoing pulmonary edema, which may be related to his cardiac condition or respiratory failure.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has persistent atrial fibrillation, which may be related to his cardiac condition or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has ongoing hypoxia, which may be related to his cardiac condition, respiratory failure, or pulmonary edema.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has ongoing tachycardia, which may be related to his cardiac condition, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects.
6. Anemia: The patient has a pronounced Hct drop, which may be related to blood loss or IV fluid administration.
7. Post-Op Ileus: The patient has ongoing post-op ileus, which may be related to his surgical procedure or medication side effects.
8. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and elevated WBC count, which may indicate an underlying infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuresis as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and metoprolol.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypoxia with oxygen therapy and diuresis.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as necessary.
5. Consider starting an ACE inhibitor once the patient's renal function improves.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's post-op ileus with bowel regimen and consider adding medication if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   Cath yesterday showed high grade mid-LAD 90% lesion with thrombus, got
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarb prior to
   procedure, Creat post-procedure was 2.6.
   At 10pm, HR increased to the 100s-110s and pt was given 30mg PO
   Diltiazem (was still on Dilt gtt 5mg/hr).  Became hypoxic to the
   mid-80s on 50% facemask.  Got 40mg IV Lasix, CXR showed worsened
   pulmonary edema.  Got Albuterol and Atroven nebs.  ABG was
   7.5/37/84/30.  HR was in the 120s to 130s and Diltiazem gtt increased
   to 15mg/hr for rate control.  Given additional 30mg PO Dilt and 25mg
   Metoprolol and standing doses increased.  Got 10mg IV Dilt X 2.  Pt was
   asymptomatic otherwise.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing spinal surgery and experiencing a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) due to a mid-LAD (left anterior descending) thrombus. He has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and MI (myocardial infarction). The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, ileus, and hypoxemia.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure yesterday, which showed a high-grade mid-LAD lesion with thrombus. He was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate prior to the procedure, and his creatinine level was 2.6 post-procedure.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's heart rate has been in the 100s to 130s, and he has been given various medications to control his heart rate, including diltiazem and metoprolol. He has also been given Lasix to treat his pulmonary edema, and his oxygen saturation has been maintained at 95% using a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His creatinine level has been rising, and he has developed acute renal failure. His hemoglobin level has also decreased, and he has been diagnosed with anemia.

The patient's plan includes continuing to monitor his oxygen saturation and heart rate, as well as adjusting his medications as needed to control his heart rate and blood pressure. He will also continue to receive diuretics to treat his pulmonary edema and will be closely monitored for signs of worsening kidney function.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema, which could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Continued elevation of creatinine levels, which could indicate worsening kidney function and the need for dialysis.
3. Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which could be life-threatening.
4. Ongoing myocardial damage, which could lead to further complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrest.
5. Infection, which could be related to the patient's recent surgery or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Continued hypoxemia, which could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could be life-threatening.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing spinal surgery. He developed a STEMI post-operatively and was treated with a stent to the mid-LAD. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), and ileus.

The patient's 24-hour events include a rise in creatinine (Cr) from 1.3 to 2.4, which is likely due to prerenal etiology. He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre and post-procedure for renal protection. The patient's vancomycin and zosyn were stopped due to lack of clinical evidence of infection, and he was continued on levofloxacin.

The patient developed hypoxia and was treated with oxygen therapy and diuresis. He was also given albuterol and atrovent for wheezing. The patient's heart rate increased to the 100s and 110s, and he was given extra doses of diltiazem and metoprolol to control his rate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), troponin-T, and creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating ongoing cardiac damage. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his calcium and magnesium levels are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes a history of CAD, MI, and atrial fibrillation. He has also had a recent episode of pulmonary edema and is at risk for further cardiac complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, MI, and atrial fibrillation puts him at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, and heart failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's rise in creatinine levels indicates ongoing renal damage, and he may be at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia and wheezing indicate ongoing respiratory compromise, and he may be at risk for further respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus and recent episode of gastrointestinal bleeding put him at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, including perforation and hemorrhage.
5. Infection: The patient's history of pulmonary edema and recent antibiotic use put him at risk for further infection, including sepsis and organ failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid and electrolyte management as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy and diuresis as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his bowel regimen as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic regimen as necessary.

The patient's code status should be full code, and his disposition should be to the CCU for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall, 96.9 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, and impaired aerobic capacity. The patient has been receiving various medications, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin, as well as IV heparin sodium and furosemide.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's respiratory support is stable, with an ABG reading of //27/.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and stool. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.2, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 439 K/uL.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
3. Impaired aerobic capacity: The patient has impaired aerobic capacity, which may affect their ability to recover from illness and may increase their risk of complications.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which may indicate an underlying infection or other medical condition.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
6. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which may be related to their medications or underlying medical condition.
7. Heart failure: The patient has acute heart failure, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
8. Pain control: The patient requires adequate pain control, as indicated by their chief complaint of pain.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase their risk of cardiac complications.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase their risk of infection and other complications.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of renal failure
2. Cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias
3. Infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia
4. Bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage
5. Respiratory failure
6. Neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke
7. Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest
8. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation
9. Infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or skin infection
10. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or pericarditis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pulmonary edema due to CHF, which is likely to worsen with continued IVF and atrial fibrillation.
	* Hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis, which may require further interventions.
2. Cardiac Complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may require further rate control measures.
	* Coronary artery disease with a history of STEMI, which may lead to recurrent cardiac events.
	* Left ventricular dysfunction with an EF of 40%, which may worsen with continued fluid overload.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure due to pre-renal azotemia, which may progress to ATN from contrast.
	* Rising creatinine levels, which may require further monitoring and potential interventions.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Post-operative ileus, which may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation.
	* Anemia due to potential surgical bleed or IVF, which may require transfusions.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Potential post-operative infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
	* Low suspicion of infection, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia, which may worsen with continued heparin therapy.
	* Potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation and platelet dysfunction.
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Potential spinal cord injury or compression due to spinal surgery, which may require further evaluation.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient's care plan should focus on:

1. Aggressive diuresis to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and rate control measures.
3. Ongoing evaluation and management of acute renal failure.
4. Proactive management of post-operative ileus and anemia.
5. Close monitoring for signs of infection and potential bleeding complications.
6. Ongoing evaluation and management of thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding complications.
7. Close monitoring for signs of spinal cord injury or compression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].  Now afebrile but on
   Tylenol and stable WBC count.
   # Hypoxia.  Much improved.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting
   of IVF in cath lab and afib with RVR.  Responded to 120mg IV Lasix
   total yesterday.  CTAB today.
   - Wean off O2
   - diurese w/ goal of -0.5L today
   - PM lytes
   - Continue Levoquin for 10 day course (today is day [**6-21**]) for HCAP.
   - f/[**Location 39**] CXR read
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - Will start  ACE when tolerated by BP and Cr. improves.
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt, successfully transitioned yesterday w/ 90mg QID,
   gtt off since 5pm.
   - Continue Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
   - Continue Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and Coumadin, d/c heparin once INR > 2.0 x 24hrs
   # PUMP:  Echo here w/ LVEF 35-40%, mild symmetric LVH w/ regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild MR.  On exam much improved from
   yesterday, trace LE edema.  Has runs of NSVT on Tele.
   - diurese today with Lasix for goal of -0.5L
   - Will start  ACEI once ARF is improved and BPs tolerate (mean SBP >
   110).
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   - Pt. will require ECHO within 6-8wks as OP and ECG to assess for need
   of an ICD, as currently w/ runs of NSVT.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable, UOP > 50cc/hr and  urine
   lytes consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Will monitor for CIN as pt. received dye load in setting of elevated
   Cr.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT 27.2, mostly ranging in 28-31 since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor
   -          guiac all stools.
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.  Pt. ambulating w/ walker comfortably.
   - change Tylenol to prn to monitor for fever, given now that he has
   been Cx.
   - oxycodone 5mg q4h prn pain
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].  Now afebrile but on
   Tylenol and stable WBC count.
   # Hypoxia.  Much improved.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting
   of IVF in cath lab and afib with RVR.  Responded to 120mg IV Lasix
   total yesterday.  CTAB today.
   - Wean off O2
   - diurese w/ goal of -0.5L today
   - PM lytes
   - Continue Levoquin for 10 day course (today is day [**6-21**]) for HCAP.
   - f/[**Location 39**] CXR read
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - Will start  ACE when tolerated by BP and Cr. improves.
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt, successfully transitioned yesterday w/ 90mg QID,
   gtt off since 5pm.
   - Continue Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
   - Continue Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and Coumadin, d/c heparin once INR > 2.0 x 24hrs
   # PUMP:  Echo here w/ LVEF 35-40%, mild symmetric LVH w/ regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild MR.  On exam much improved from
   yesterday, trace LE edema.  Has runs of NSVT on Tele.
   - diurese today with Lasix for goal of -0.5L
   - Will start  ACEI once ARF is improved and BPs tolerate (mean SBP >
   110).
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   - Pt. will require ECHO within 6-8wks as OP and ECG to assess for need
   of an ICD, as currently w/ runs of NSVT.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable, UOP > 50cc/hr and  urine
   lytes consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Will monitor for CIN as pt. received dye load in setting of elevated
   Cr.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT 27.2, mostly ranging in 28-31 since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor
   -          guiac all stools.
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.  Pt. ambulating w/ walker comfortably.
   - change Tylenol to prn to monitor for fever, given now that he has
   been Cx.
   - oxycodone 5mg q4h prn pain
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was transferred from another hospital after undergoing spinal surgery and developing a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and MI (myocardial infarction).

The patient's current condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. The patient has undergone catheterization with a mid-LAD thrombus and has been treated with IV Lasix, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination reveals a middle-aged male who is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress. The patient has a mild degree of peripheral edema and a slightly distended abdomen.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, MI, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has undergone catheterization and has been treated with anticoagulation therapy and diuretics.

The patient's current medications include:

* Aspirin 325mg daily
* Plavix
* Heparin gtt
* Metoprolol 25mg PO TID
* Simvastatin
* Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
* Lasix 40mg IV daily
* Tylenol prn for pain
* Oxycodone 5mg q4h prn for pain

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pulmonary edema
* Atrial fibrillation
* Acute renal failure
* Ileus
* Anemia
* Hypoxemia
* CIN (contrast-induced nephropathy)
* Post-op infection
* Post-op bleeding
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* LV (left ventricular) dysfunction
* MR (mitral regurgitation)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off oxygen therapy
* Continuing diuretic therapy
* Monitoring for CIN
* Holding nephrotoxic medications
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy
* Monitoring for post-op infection
* Monitoring for post-op bleeding
* Continuing cardiac diet
* Continuing bowel regimen
* Monitoring for anemia
* Monitoring for hypoxemia

The patient's disposition is to continue care in the CCU (coronary care unit) with ongoing monitoring and treatment of his conditions."
