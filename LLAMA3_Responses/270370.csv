   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 32F with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA.
   .
   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicateds poor
   control of blood sugars, was previously followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**] but has not
   been seen recently. Gap was closed and bicarb had normalized somewhat
   but repeat labs this am show widened gap and decreased bicarb,
   worsening acidosis. She was also unable to tolerate POs with nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness causing N/V
   which have persisted, as pt reports adherence to her insulin and there
   is no other obvious source of infection. Per report pt does have a h/o
   insulin non-adherence. Other possible etiologies include infection
   although denies focal symptoms, does have elevated WBC but stable,
   afebrile.
   -- Will restart  insulin gtt at 4 units
   -- Continue PO challenge as tolerated
   -- DC SC insulin while on gtt
   -- q1-2h FSG
   -- q4-6h chemistries
   -- continue D51/2NS with K. Will recheck K at 10am
   -- reglan and zofran prn nausea

   # Factor VIII inhibitor - s/p rituximab and steroids
   -- avoid sQ heparin, monitor for bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was unable to tolerate oral intake due to nausea and vomiting and required insulin drip discontinuation overnight. Her blood sugar levels trended up, and her bicarbonate levels decreased, indicating worsening acidosis. The patient's hemodynamic parameters are stable, with a heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 165/99 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for mild dehydration and no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, ketones, and urinary albumin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further deterioration of acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are decreasing, indicating worsening acidosis, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin drip was discontinued overnight, and her blood sugar levels trended up. There is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin drip is restarted without proper monitoring.
3. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and persistent nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of moderate bacteria on urine analysis suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was previously elevated, and there is a risk of hypertension-related complications if not properly managed.
6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a history of factor VIII inhibitor and is at risk of developing VTE, particularly with the use of heparin.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diabetic gastroparesis and nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with an unknown allergy to Augmentin. They have been receiving infusions and other medications, including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 132 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 165/99 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 98% and no oxygen delivery device being used.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (1.19 mg/dL), potassium (4.0 mEq/L), and phosphorus (2.3 mEq/L), which may indicate kidney dysfunction. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, and their neurologic status is not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine and phosphorus levels suggest potential kidney damage, which can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and decreased clearance of waste products.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's elevated potassium and phosphorus levels may cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
3. Infection: The patient's unknown allergy to Augmentin and the presence of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the ICU setting.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of respiratory failure is still present, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac stress, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's limited neurologic examination and the presence of antibiotics may increase the risk of neurologic complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may indicate gastrointestinal distress, which can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a young female who was admitted to the ICU with unknown allergies and is receiving antibiotics for an infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 132 bpm, blood pressure of 165/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient is receiving various medications, including Augmentin, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and glucose levels, with a Cr of 0.6 mg/dL and a glucose level of 112 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The patient's respiratory examination shows clear lungs, and the patient is not requiring oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results also show elevated levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal dysfunction, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose level may indicate hyperglycemia, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
3. Infection: The patient's unknown allergies and receipt of antibiotics may indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Thrombosis: The patient's receipt of heparin sodium for prophylaxis may indicate a risk of thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or stroke.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's tachycardia and receipt of antibiotics may indicate a risk of stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
6. VAP: The patient's receipt of antibiotics and mechanical ventilation may indicate a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

Further evaluation and management of these potential complications is necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) who presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Her DKA has resolved, and her bicarbonate levels are close to normal. She has a history of insulin non-adherence and reports adherence to her insulin regimen. Her current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 132 beats per minute, blood pressure of 165/99 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving insulin via subcutaneous (sQ) injection and is being challenged with oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: Given the patient's history of insulin non-adherence and her current insulin regimen, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving sQ insulin, which may lead to hypoglycemia, especially if the dose is not adjusted properly.
3. Infection: Although the patient's DKA has resolved, there is still a risk of infection, particularly in the context of her history of insulin non-adherence and the presence of a central line.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a Factor VIII inhibitor, and the use of heparin has been avoided to prevent bleeding. However, there is still a risk of bleeding due to the presence of other medications and the patient's underlying medical condition.
5. Hyperglycemia: Given the patient's history of Type 1 DM, there is a risk of hyperglycemia, especially if her insulin regimen is not adjusted properly.
6. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving fluid therapy, which may lead to fluid overload, especially if her cardiac function is compromised.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure, especially if her underlying lung disease is not well-controlled.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin regimen as needed to prevent hypoglycemia.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely to prevent hypotension and tachycardia.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely to prevent fluid overload.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's insulin regimen to prevent hyperglycemia.
6. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a diabetes specialist to optimize the patient's insulin regimen and prevent future episodes of DKA."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 32F with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA.
   .
   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicateds poor
   control of blood sugars, was previously followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**] but has not
   been seen recently. Gap was closed and bicarb had normalized somewhat
   but repeat labs this am show widened gap and decreased bicarb,
   worsening acidosis. She was also unable to tolerate POs with nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness causing N/V
   which have persisted, as pt reports adherence to her insulin and there
   is no other obvious source of infection. Per report pt does have a h/o
   insulin non-adherence. Other possible etiologies include infection
   although denies focal symptoms, does have elevated WBC but stable,
   afebrile.
   -- Will restart  insulin gtt at 4 units
   -- Continue PO challenge as tolerated
   -- DC SC insulin while on gtt
   -- q1-2h FSG
   -- q4-6h chemistries
   -- continue D51/2NS with K. Will recheck K at 10am
   -- reglan and zofran prn nausea
   -- [**Last Name (un) 276**] c/s
   -- will also check UA and urine cx to eval source of infxn given mod
   bacteria on UA, no prior cx
   .
   # Factor VIII inhibitor - s/p rituximab and steroids
   -- avoid sQ heparin, monitor for bleeding
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-25**] DKA, but other possible etiologies include
   diabetic gastroparesis. Given temporal association with DKA, most
   likely etiology.
   - prn Reglan, Zofran
   # Hypertension: Now normotensive but was hypertensive overnight.  Was
   likely [**2-25**] agitation, N/V. Will follow. No know prior h/o HTN and was
   not previously on any antihypertensives. She is young with no known h/o
   cardiovascular disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's initial labs showed a widened anion gap and decreased bicarbonate levels, indicating worsening acidosis. She was unable to tolerate oral medications due to nausea and vomiting.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 128 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 143/90 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.3 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 35.7%
* White blood cell count: 14.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 426 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 122 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving insulin via a continuous infusion at 4 units, and PO challenge as tolerated. She is also receiving D51/2NS with potassium to correct her electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening acidosis
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypoglycemia
* Infection, particularly urinary tract infection (UTI) given the patient's positive urine culture
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroparesis, due to the patient's history of insulin non-adherence
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's history of factor VIII inhibitor and treatment with rituximab and steroids
* Hypertension, which may be related to the patient's agitation and nausea
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer due to the patient's immobility and use of central lines
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's respiratory support.

The patient's plan of care includes restarting insulin infusion, continuing PO challenge as tolerated, and monitoring her electrolyte levels, glucose levels, and blood counts. The patient will also be monitored for signs of infection, and her urine culture will be repeated to evaluate the source of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was admitted with an elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) indicating poor baseline control of blood sugars. The patient has tolerated some oral intake with some nausea and vomiting. The etiology of DKA appears to be a nonspecific illness or a urinary tract infection (UTI) given the dirty urine analysis (UA). The patient reports adherence to her insulin regimen, but there is no other obvious source of infection.

The patient is currently being managed with:

* Hold insulin drip after overlapped with 14 units of Lantus and increased sliding scale
* Continue PO challenge as tolerated
* q2h FSG and q6h chemistries
* Continue D51/2NS with K, recheck K at 10 am
* Reglan and Zofran PRN for nausea
* Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**]'s consultation
* Treat for uncomplicated UTI and follow-up culture

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of DKA: The patient's gap is still closed, but she is taking minimal oral intake, which may lead to a recurrence of DKA.
2. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may persist, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was mildly hypertensive overnight, which may be related to agitation, nausea, or other factors. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
4. Factor VIII inhibitor: The patient has a history of factor VIII inhibitor, and the use of rituximab and steroids may have exacerbated the condition. Close monitoring for bleeding is necessary.
5. UTI: The patient's dirty UA suggests a UTI, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent complications.
6. Diabetic gastroparesis: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to diabetic gastroparesis, which needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Further recommendations:

* Monitor the patient's gap closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage nausea and vomiting with Reglan, Zofran, and Compazine as needed.
* Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's UTI and follow up with cultures.
* Consider further evaluation for diabetic gastroparesis if the patient's nausea and vomiting persist."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 32F with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA.
   .
   # DKA
 Patient admitted with DKA. Elevated HgbA1c indicates poor
   baseline control of blood sugars. Gap now closed and bicarb has
   normalized. She has tolerated some PO intake with some nausea and
   vomiting. Etiology appears to have been nonspecific illness vs. UTI
   given dirty UA . Pt reports adherence to her insulin and there is no
   other obvious source of infection. Per report pt also has h/o insulin
   non-adherence.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a gap in her blood sugar control, which has now been closed. The patient has been tolerating some oral intake with some nausea and vomiting.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/90 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.7, hemoglobin of 33.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 426. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient is being treated for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with ciprofloxacin, and her urine culture is pending. She is also being monitored for factor VIII inhibitor, which was treated with rituximab and steroids.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are being managed with reglan, zofran, and compazine as needed. She is also being monitored for hypertension, which was previously mildly elevated, but is now normotensive.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing her insulin glargine and sliding scale insulin, as well as monitoring her blood sugars and chemistries. She will also be continued on D51/2NS with potassium and will be rechecked for potassium at 10 am.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of DKA: The patient's blood sugar levels may continue to fluctuate, leading to further complications.
2. UTI: The patient's UTI may not be fully treated, leading to further complications such as sepsis.
3. Factor VIII inhibitor: The patient's factor VIII inhibitor may not be fully controlled, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may continue, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be fully controlled, leading to further cardiovascular complications.
6. Poor glycemic control: The patient's blood sugar levels may not be fully controlled, leading to further complications such as ketoacidosis.
7. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which could lead to further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old female with Type 1 DM presenting with DKA. She was admitted with an elevated HgbA1c, indicating poor baseline control of blood sugars. The patient has tolerated some PO intake with some nausea and vomiting. The etiology of DKA appears to be a nonspecific illness vs. UTI, given the dirty UA. The patient reports adherence to her insulin, but there is no other obvious source of infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 143/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with a rate of 16 inspirations per minute. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of cardiac or respiratory distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 457 K/uL, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Her glucose level is within normal limits, and her electrolyte levels are slightly elevated. The patient's urinalysis shows a dirty UA with many bacteria.

The patient's plan of care includes holding insulin gtt after overlapped with 14 units of Lantus and increasing the sliding scale, continuing PO challenge as tolerated, and monitoring for nausea and vomiting. The patient will also be treated for uncomplicated UTI and followed up with urine cultures.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is within normal limits, but the risk of hyperglycemia remains, especially with the patient's history of DKA.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin gtt has been held, but the risk of hypoglycemia remains, especially if the patient's glucose level drops.
3. UTI: The patient has been treated for uncomplicated UTI, but the risk of complications, such as sepsis, remains.
4. Infection: The patient's dirty UA and history of DKA suggest the possibility of an underlying infection.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but the risk of hypertension remains, especially with the patient's history of DKA.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of DKA and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of DKA and hypertension may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of DKA and nausea and vomiting may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
10. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of Factor VIII inhibitor and treatment with rituximab and steroids may increase the risk of bleeding complications."
