   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient remains hypercalcemic to Ca=16,
   and Ringers has been switched to NS to eliminate all Ca from IV
   We
ll continue to give vigorous IV NS and use lasix to avoid further
   edema and third spacing elsewhere.   Her CXR looks quite suspicious for
   sarcoid with bilateral and mediastinal adenopathy, and this might also
   explain her hypercalcemia.  We will further evaluate this with chest CT
   and serum ACE, but at some point she may come to node biopsy for
   definitive dx and rx.  Meanwhile her hip pain will be further evaluated
   with pelvic CT.  However she would seem to merit a reevaluation of the
   status of her squamous cell skin cancer (?PET-CT?), and we will contact
   Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name (NI) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of whom know her well for this problem.  The
   patient is stable enough to continue her IV fluids on the floor and
   we
ll call her out to an onc floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**]
s note and agree with her
   findings and plan of care.  The patient remains hypercalcemic to Ca=16,
   and Ringers has been switched to NS to eliminate all Ca from IV
   We
ll continue to give vigorous IV NS and use lasix to avoid further
   edema and third spacing elsewhere.   Her CXR looks quite suspicious for
   sarcoid with bilateral and mediastinal adenopathy, and this might also
   explain her hypercalcemia.  We will further evaluate this with chest CT
   and serum ACE, but at some point she may come to node biopsy for
   definitive dx and rx.  Meanwhile her hip pain will be further evaluated
   with pelvic CT.  However she would seem to merit a reevaluation of the
   status of her squamous cell skin cancer (?PET-CT?), and we will contact
   Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name (NI) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of whom know her well for this problem.  The
   patient is stable enough to continue her IV fluids on the floor and
   we
ll call her out to an onc floor.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the key points as follows:

1. The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, s/p excision, admitted with hypercalcemia (Ca=19.8) and currently has a calcium level of 16.0 mg/dL.
2. The patient has a history of allergic reaction to calcitonin and is currently receiving pamidronate.
3. The patient's hypercalcemia is likely caused by the production of PTH-rP by the squamous cell carcinoma, but other possibilities include bony metastases or sarcoidosis.
4. The patient is receiving IVF hydration, and her urine output is 400cc/hr. She will be started on normal saline today for a few liters and then returned to LR once she appears euvolemic.
5. The patient has elevated LFTs and lipase, which may be secondary to pancreatitis, and her AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase will be trended.
6. The patient has chronic iron-deficiency anemia and is a Jehovah's Witness, therefore, she will not receive blood transfusions.
7. The patient has right posterior hip pain, which may be secondary to metastases or pain from positional changes, and will require a bone scan and possibly a pelvic CT to evaluate for metastatic or malignant lesions.
8. The patient has elevated Cr, which may be due to prerenal or direct renal vasoconstriction effects of hypercalcemia, and will require continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia.
9. The patient has mild perihilar densities on CXR, which may be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis, and will require a chest CT to evaluate these areas.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypercalcemia-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
2. Pancreatitis and pancreatic damage due to elevated lipase levels.
3. Respiratory failure due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure due to electrolyte imbalances and hypercalcemia.
5. Gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting due to hypercalcemia and bowel regimen.
6. Sarcoidosis-related respiratory and cardiac complications.
7. Metastatic disease progression and recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma.
8. Anemia-related complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased tolerance to stress.
9. Hypercalcemia-related neuromuscular complications such as weakness, muscle cramps, and seizures.

To mitigate these complications, the patient will require close monitoring of her electrolyte levels, calcium levels, and kidney function, as well as ongoing management of her hypercalcemia, pancreatitis, and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8. Her calcium levels decreased to 15 yesterday but are increasing again to 16 today. The differential diagnosis includes PTH-rP production by the tumor, bony metastases, and sarcoidosis. The patient has been started on IVF hydration, lasix, and pamidronate to manage hypercalcemia. She has also been experiencing acute renal failure, elevated LFTs/lipase, and chronic iron-deficiency anemia. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercalcemia: If left untreated, hypercalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and if not managed promptly, can lead to end-stage renal disease.
3. Sarcoidosis: If the patient's hypercalcemia is secondary to sarcoidosis, it can lead to widespread inflammation and organ damage.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels could indicate pancreatitis, which can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to respiratory failure, especially if not managed with adequate hydration and calcium control.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: Hypercalcemia can also lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and cardiac failure.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not managed promptly.
8. Infectious Complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state can lead to infections, especially if not managed with adequate antimicrobial therapy.
9. Metastatic Disease: The patient's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma can lead to further complications, such as spinal cord compression, lung metastases, and liver metastases."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   proximal
   left femur is unchanged from [**2175-6-5**]. Of note, if there remains concern
   for

   sensitive
   evaluation.
   2. Medial left thigh abscess seen on outside hospital CT is not imaged
   in the
   field of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u PTH  , PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  Likely
   prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**]  showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - Volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia as above.
   - Trend Cr
   - Check Urine lytes
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   - need Bone Scan
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine 2-4 mg IV q6h prn for pain control.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - NPO for now with IVF.
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8. Her calcium levels have decreased to 15 and then increased again to 16. She has a history of allergic reaction to calcitonin and is currently being treated with pamidronate. Her hypercalcemia is suspected to be secondary to her cancer, possibly producing PTH-rP or bony metastases. She has acute renal failure, which is likely prerenal, and is being managed with volume repletion and treatment of hypercalcemia. She also has right posterior hip pain, elevated LFTs and lipase, and chronic iron-deficiency anemia. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and does not want blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening hypercalcemia: If not properly managed, hypercalcemia can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and kidney damage.
2. Acute renal failure: If not managed properly, acute renal failure can lead to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
3. Right posterior hip pain: If not properly evaluated and managed, the patient's right posterior hip pain could lead to further complications such as limited mobility, decreased quality of life, and potential need for surgical intervention.
4. Elevated LFTs and lipase: If not properly managed, elevated LFTs and lipase could lead to pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Chronic iron-deficiency anemia: If not properly managed, chronic iron-deficiency anemia could lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
6. Metastatic disease: If not properly managed, the patient's metastatic squamous cell carcinoma could lead to further complications such as widespread metastases, decreased quality of life, and potential need for palliative care."

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another
   periptheral IV, so put patient in for an urgent PICC

   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, who was admitted with hypercalcemia. The patient's condition has progressed rapidly, with new findings on CT scans showing innumerable lung nodules, large hilar masses, and lytic lesions in the bilateral iliac bones, left inguinal LAD, and surrounding fat stranding.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels have decreased from 19.8 to 14.1, but the most likely etiology is recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets seen in her pelvis on CT.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's Cr has improved to 2.2 from 3.2, but part of her ARF could be due to the direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall in the GFR.
3. Right Posterior Hip Pain: The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, and X-rays have not been helpful. The pain could be secondary to metastases or positional changes.
4. Elevated LFTs/Lipase: The patient has mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase, which could be secondary to pancreatitis or hypercalcemia.
5. Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased to 29 from 34.2, and she is a Jehovah's Witness who would not want transfusion of any type of blood products.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with Lasix.
2. F/U with oncology about further plans for possible bx of lung lesions.

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place

   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another
   periptheral IV, so put patient in for an urgent PICC.  If repeat
   morning labs show decreasing calcium then will decrease IVF rate to
   200cc/hr as patient is fluid overloaded with bilateral pleural
   effusions.  If Ca continues to decrease will discontinue lasix with
   decrease in IVF rate.

   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid

   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease, especially with the bony mets
   seen in her pelvis on CT.  Prior to the CT scan based on CXR findings,
   there was concern for possible Sarcoid, which seems less likely now,
   but will follow up final CT scan read.
   - Have been continuing NS with 20meq of K+ at 300cc/hr with lasix [**Hospital1 **],
   having difficulty drawing labs and were unable to get another
   periptheral IV, so put patient in for an urgent PICC.  If repeat
   morning labs show decreasing calcium then will decrease IVF rate to
   200cc/hr as patient is fluid overloaded with bilateral pleural
   effusions.  If Ca continues to decrease will discontinue lasix with
   decrease in IVF rate.

   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient had a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.  Both
   improving, patient currently tolerating a regular diet without

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, admitted with hypercalcemia. Her condition has rapidly progressed, with new findings on CT scans showing innumerable pulmonary nodules, large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally, and left inguinal enlarging LAD. She has also developed bilateral pleural effusions and cholelithiasis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but her laboratory results are concerning, with elevated calcium levels, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. She has also developed acute renal failure, likely due to hypercalcemia. The patient is currently fluid overloaded and has been placed on a PICC line for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary nodules may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, requiring dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines may increase her risk of infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and hypercalcemia may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's central lines and hypercalcemia may increase her risk of thrombosis.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's rapidly progressing disease may lead to further metastases, affecting multiple organs and systems.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, and bilateral pleural effusions. She should be continued on IV fluids and lasix, with adjustments made as necessary. The patient's central lines should be managed to minimize the risk of infection and thrombosis. Further imaging studies, such as a bone scan and possible biopsy of pulmonary nodules, should be discussed with the oncology team. The patient's pain management should be optimized, and her constipation should be addressed."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 15 yesterday from 19 on admission that morning, but is
   increasing again to 16 this AM.  Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung
   and head and neck are known to produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin
   could possibly produce this.  This could also be secondary to bony mets
   ; she does have elevated Alk Phos.  Another possibility on differential
   is sarcoidosis because of increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is
   normal level, but should be lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 2.2 today from 3.2 (her baseline is 0.6-0.7).  [**Month (only) 8**] still
   be prerenal.  Abdominal US at [**Hospital1 2840**] showed no evidence of
   hydronephrosis.  Part of her ARF could also be due to the direct renal
   vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney causing a fall
   in the GFR.
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Right posterior hip pain:
   The patient has focal iliac crest pain on exam, Xrays have not been
   helpful.  On exam she has no evidence of weakness or neuro findings.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes. Pt also
   has left knee pain.
   - need Bone Scan this week to evaluate for metastatic/malignant lesions
   - Consider pelvis CT to evaluate the soft tissue around the hip for
   source of the pain.
   - Morphine for pain control
 consider switching to a different PO med,
   though pt feels that she had recently been having more difficulty
   swallowing recently
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:
   The patient has a mildly elevated AST, alk phos, LDH, and lipase.
   Pancreatitis is a uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia so her elevated
   lipase could be secondary to pancreatitis.  Improving slowly
   - Trend LFTs/lipase
   - advance diet slowly
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids.  She is a
   Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not want tranfusion of any type
   of blood products.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Guaiac stools given history of black stool.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  The patient is s/p excision in
   [**7-6**].  She had discussed radiation treatment, but had opted against
   it.  Her current presenatation of hypercalcemia is concerning for
   reoccurance of her squamous cell carcinoma.
   - Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] about his perspective regarding her cancer status

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease.
   Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and head and neck are known to
   produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin could possibly produce this.
   This could also be secondary to bony mets ; she does have elevated Alk
   Phos.  Another possibility on differential is sarcoidosis because of
   increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is normal level, but should be
   lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal
   Saline today for a few liters, then return to LR.  Once she appears
   euvolemic, will aim for UOP of 100-150 cc/hr.
   - lasix [**Hospital1 **] to lessen overall edema and fluid in lungs, possibly to
   help w Ca as well
   - Avoid calcitonin bc of allergic reaction, but ask endo about
   premedicating for calcitonin
   - f/u Endocrine Recs
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP  ,  Vit D
   - Bone Scan on weekday
   - Bowel regimen for constipation and zofran prn for nausea.
   - consider Hemodialysis if Ca cannot be decreased
   - f/u w Renal recs
   .
   # Perihilar densities:
   [**Month (only) 8**] be malignant spread to lymph nodes or sarcoidosis.
   - Chest CT today to evaluate perihilar areas
   - ACE level
   - f/u [**1-22**]-OH and 25-OH Vit D levels
   - speak w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who knows pt from previously

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 14.1 yesterday evening, patient refused labs overnight
   and this morning nursing and IV nurse were unable to draw labs or place
   a new peripheral, put patient in for a PICC.  CT scan showed concern
   for progression of malignancy with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar
   masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally and left inguinal
   enlarging LAD.  Given new CT scan findings the most likely etiology is
   recurrence of her metastatic disease.
   Squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and head and neck are known to
   produce PTH-rP so her SSC of the skin could possibly produce this.
   This could also be secondary to bony mets ; she does have elevated Alk
   Phos.  Another possibility on differential is sarcoidosis because of
   increased peri-hilar densities.  PTH is normal level, but should be
   lower with such high calcium
   - IVF hydration continued.  Urine output 400cc/hr.  will start Normal

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, who was admitted with hypercalcemia. Her current presentation is concerning for recurrence of her squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has undergone excision of the tumor in [**7-6**], but had opted against radiation treatment. Her hypercalcemia has been managed with IVF hydration, Lasix, and pamidronate. She has also been experiencing right posterior hip pain, which is being evaluated with a bone scan and pelvis CT. The patient has elevated LFTs and lipase, which may be secondary to pancreatitis or hypercalcemia. She has a history of chronic iron-deficiency anemia and is a Jehovah's Witness, therefore, she does not want any type of blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient's current presentation of hypercalcemia is concerning for recurrence of her squamous cell carcinoma.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 3.2 to 2.2, but it is still elevated and may be secondary to prerenal failure, direct renal vasoconstriction effect of hypercalcemia, or other causes.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase level may be secondary to pancreatitis, which is an uncommon side effect of hypercalcemia.
4. Chronic Iron-Deficiency Anemia: The patient's Hct level is 29, which is lower than her baseline level, and may require further evaluation and management.
5. Right Posterior Hip Pain: The patient's hip pain may be secondary to metastases or pain for positional changes, and further evaluation with a bone scan and pelvis CT is necessary.
6. Hypercalcemia-Related Complications: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to other complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to her cancer and chemotherapy may increase her risk of infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's history of chronic iron-deficiency anemia and her current hypercalcemia may increase her risk of bleeding.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her hypercalcemia, as well as further evaluation and management of her other medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast, presenting with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 196/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has been receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage her fluid status and hypercalcemia.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated calcium level of 14.1 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphorus level of 2.8 mg/dL. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 229 K/uL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 49 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 26 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show multiple lung nodules and a large pelvic mass, as well as lytic lesions in the bones. She has also been diagnosed with pleural effusions and small-modular effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she has a history of lung nodules and pleural effusions, which could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but her hypercalcemia could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is currently being managed with IV fluids and diuretics, but she may require further intervention to prevent chronic kidney disease.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of metastatic cancer make her susceptible to infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's hypercalcemia could lead to neurological symptoms such as seizures, confusion, or weakness.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and history of metastatic cancer make her susceptible to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and history of metastatic cancer make her susceptible to hematological complications such as bleeding or blood clots.
8. Bone complications: The patient's metastatic cancer and history of lytic lesions make her susceptible to bone complications such as pathologic fractures or spinal cord compression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide cardiac medications as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with IV fluids and diuretics.
4. Monitor the patient's infection status and provide antibiotics as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide neurological medications as needed.
6. Manage the patient's constipation with laxatives or stool softeners.
7. Monitor the patient's hematological status and provide blood transfusions as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's bone status and provide pain management as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, presenting with hypercalcemia, constipation, mild hyponatremia, anxiety, acute renal failure (ARF), and anemia. She has been treated with IV fluids, lasix, and morphine, and has undergone imaging studies, including a chest CT and pelvic CT, which revealed multiple lung nodules and a large inguinal lymph node. The patient's hypercalcemia is suspected to be related to her metastatic disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Worsening of ARF due to continued hypercalcemia and dehydration.
2. Respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, due to the multiple lung nodules and pleural effusions.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Infection, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression due to the patient's cancer and treatment.
6. Constipation and bowel obstruction due to the patient's constipation and potential tumor involvement of the bowel.
7. Further metastasis and progression of the patient's cancer.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient had multiple BM
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; patient
   snoring so concern for sleep apnea
   - DCed lasix

   Other labs:
   Ca: 11.8,  Mg: 2.0,   Phos: 3.1
   TSH: 2.2
   Imaging:
   CT Pelvis:  IMPRESSION: 1. New lytic lesions throughout the pelvis and
   new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all
   indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
   2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   3. Diverticulosis
   CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions. Overall,
   these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**] and concerning for rapid progression
   of neoplastic disease in a person with known history of previous
   malignancy.
   2. Expansile lesion posteriorly at the T10 veterbral body with
   associated narrowing of the central canal
   3. New bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Inadequately characterized hepatic hypodensities.
   5. Cholelithiasis.
   Bone Scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Known T10 vertebral body and pelvic osseous
   metastases do not demonstrate significant tracer avidity. 2. Marked
   right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an
   obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a
   diagnostic consideration. 3. Bilateral femoral shaft uptake may reflect
   hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 4. Difficult to exclude a
   skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient, and spoke with
   her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the oncology floor
   when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect, BP may also
   improve with decrease in total body volume
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well but will transition to po oxycodone liquid as patient has
   difficulty swallowing pills
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease,  per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will
   consult IR for biopsy of one of the lesions in her iliac bones
   - patient for transfer to OMED when she leaves ICU for further
   management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient had multiple BM
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; patient
   snoring so concern for sleep apnea

   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8, which has since decreased to 11.8. She has a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, and recent imaging studies show marked progression of the disease with innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions, and possible metastases to the chest wall, skull, and femoral hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.

The patient has been experiencing increasing tachycardia, with a heart rate of up to 130s, despite fluid boluses and anti-anxiety medication. Her blood pressure is consistently elevated, around 190/100 mmHg, and she has been started on labetalol for control. She also has right posterior hip pain, which is likely related to lytic lesions on CT scan.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a decrease in creatinine from 3.2 to 1.9, and her calcium levels are now within normal range. She has been started on pamidronate and will continue to receive aggressive hydration and volume repletion.

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with potential medical complications including:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypercalcemia and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
2. Hypertension and tachycardia, which may be related to anxiety, pain, dehydration, or underlying cardiac disease.
3. Right posterior hip pain, which may be related to lytic lesions on CT scan.
4. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which is likely to progress and may cause further complications.
5. Iron-deficiency anemia, which may be related to chronic bleeding or malabsorption.
6. Potential for sleep apnea, which may be related to obesity and snoring.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying disease.

The patient will require close monitoring and management of her condition, including ongoing hydration, volume repletion, and medication adjustments to control her hypertension and tachycardia. She will also require further imaging studies and biopsies to confirm the extent of her disease and guide treatment."

   Imaging:
   CT Pelvis:  IMPRESSION: 1. New lytic lesions throughout the pelvis and
   new subcutaneous left lower quadrant and left inguinal nodules, all
   indicative of marked progression of metastatic disease.
   2. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
   3. Diverticulosis
   CT Chest: IMPRESSION: 1. Marked progression of extensive bilateral
   pulmonary nodules with large hilar masses inseparable from mediastinal
   lymphadenopathy as well as numerous ossesous lytic lesions. Overall,
   these findings are new since [**Month (only) 1646**] and concerning for rapid progression
   of neoplastic disease in a person with known history of previous
   malignancy.
   2. Expansile lesion posteriorly at the T10 veterbral body with
   associated narrowing of the central canal
   3. New bilateral pleural effusions.
   4. Inadequately characterized hepatic hypodensities.
   5. Cholelithiasis.
   Bone Scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Known T10 vertebral body and pelvic osseous
   metastases do not demonstrate significant tracer avidity. 2. Marked
   right upper thoracic anterior chest wall uptake does not have an
   obvious CT correlate, though early rib/chest wall metastasis is a
   diagnostic consideration. 3. Bilateral femoral shaft uptake may reflect
   hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 4. Difficult to exclude a
   skull metastasis in the setting of mild focal uptake.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient yesterday, and
   spoke with her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the
   oncology floor when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:  LFT
s have normalized except for a mildy
   elevated Alk Phos, related to bony mets
   - patient currently tolerating a regular diet without difficulty
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease, patient for transfer
   to OMED when she leaves ICU for further management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - double lumen PICC line placed morning of [**10-10**]
   - still very anxious ; responds well to ativan
   - Bone Scan today by Nuclear Medicine
   - Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] stopped by in evening.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] told her it is
   most likely metastatic cancer.  He thinks we need a tissue biopsy,
   possibly just from medial leg (which he thinks is likely the same as
   what is in the lungs)
   - was called out to OMED ---> but we kept her b/c of her very elevated
   BPs and HRs
   - intensified bowel regimen --> patient has been stooling all
   afternoon/evening
   - Patient has been having increasing tachycardia all night, up to 130s,
   appears to be in sinus rhythm -- tried fluid boluses, tried
   anti-anxiety (ativan), which have not improved it ; consider also PE,
   though not strong enough suspicion to start heparin (cannot give her
   contrast for scan); consider also SVT? though looks like sinus rhythm
   - also has been having increasing BPs, consistently around 190/100-->
   gave IV hydralazine acutely; PO hydral did not seem to have much
   effect, so started labetalol low-dose (200mg [**Hospital1 **]) which helped both HR
   and BP... though the concern was not to mask whatever was causing the
   tachycardia
   - pt does have dropping O2 sat to low 90s when sleeping; may be related
   to orthopnea, pleural effusions, ?sleep apnea
   - DCed lasix

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with metaststic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid
   medial thigh s/p excision in [**7-6**] admitted with hypercalcemia of 19.8.
   # Hypercalcemia:
   Ca decreased to 11.8 today with continued IV hydration at a lower rate,
   she continues to have brisk urine output, even with the discontinuation
   of the lasix.  CT scan concerning for progression of malignancy with
   innumerable pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac
   bones bilaterally and left inguinal enlarging LAD, which is the most
   likely cause of her hypercalcemia.
   - Decreased IVF rate to 150cc/hr since her calcium has been improving
   and she is LOS up about 9L of fluid, also discontinued lasix as her
   urine output has remained brisk and calcium is down to 11.8.
   - Renal function improving with IVF and decreasing calcium
   - Bone Scan: shows known bony mets, but also with concern for possible
   mets to the chest wall, possible skull mets, and femoral hypertrophic
   pulmonary osteoarthropathy.
   - Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] came by to see the patient yesterday, and
   spoke with her about her metastatic disease, patient will go to the
   oncology floor when she leaves the ICU for further management
   - constipation related to hypercalcemia has resolved with aggressive
   bowel regimen, will continue bowel regimen as patient also continues to
   receive narcotics
   - Mildly elevated Alk Phos from her bony mets
   - Continue pamidronate
   - f/u  PTHrP , Vit D, ACE level
   - Renal and Endocrine following, appreciate recs
   .
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr improved to 1.9 today from 3.2 on admission (her baseline is
   0.6-0.7), most likely due to her hypercalemia, renal function is
   improving with decreased calcium and continued hydration
   - continued volume repletion and management of hypercalcemia
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
No NSAIDS
   # Hypertension/Tachycardia: initially thought to be due to anxiety/pain
   and dehydration, which may still be playing a role, however ativan has
   not really helped, and patient has been aggressively hydrated with
   IVF
s.  In discussion with her husband, it sounds like she was
   hypertensive prior to admission (SBP
s in the 150
s) but not on any
   medications, which may be exacerbated by the stress of the hospital.
   - EKG showed Sinus Tachycardia
 no response to ativan, morhpine, IVF
   - Started labetalol for BP and HR control with some effect
   # Right posterior hip pain:  The patient has focal iliac crest pain on
   exam, has lytic lesions on CT scan
   - Morphine for pain control, small doses have currently been working
   well.
   # Elevated LFTs/lipase:  LFT
s have normalized except for a mildy
   elevated Alk Phos, related to bony mets
   - patient currently tolerating a regular diet without difficulty
   # Chronic iron-deficiency anemia:
   The patient's Hct is 29 (from 34.2) after lots of fluids, and has
   remained stable.  She is a Jehovah's Witness and therefore would not
   want tranfusion of any type of blood products.
   # Metastastic squamous cell carcinoma:  Hypercalcemia and imaging are
   very concerning for worsening metastatic disease, patient for transfer
   to OMED when she leaves ICU for further management

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the left mid medial thigh, s/p excision in July. She has a history of hypercalcemia, which has been managed with IV hydration and IV pamidronate. Recent imaging studies, including CT scans of the chest and pelvis, show marked progression of metastatic disease, including bilateral pulmonary nodules, hilar masses, bony lesions in the iliac bones bilaterally, and left inguinal enlarging lymphadenopathy. The patient has been experiencing hypertension, tachycardia, and right posterior hip pain, which has been managed with medication and hydration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 35.8°C, heart rate 103-132 bpm, blood pressure 139/79-186/105 mmHg, respiratory rate 21-29 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 94%.
* Physical examination: Alert, oriented, anxious; sclera anicteric, dry mucus membranes, oropharynx clear; decreased breath sounds at the bases, L>R; regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops; moderately distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds; warm, well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses; increased nonpitting edema in the lower extremities, left greater than right.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 10.4-17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin 9.7-12.2 g/dL, platelet count 104-137 K/uL; calcium 11.8-19.8 mg/dL, magnesium 2.0-2.2 mg/dL, phosphorus 3.1-4.1 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase 31-59 IU/L; creatinine 1.9-2.7 mg/dL; glucose 92-173 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening metastatic disease: The patient's imaging studies show marked progression of metastatic disease, which could lead to further complications and decreased quality of life.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are still elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, and muscle weakness.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as chronic kidney disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are still elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation could lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction and fecal impaction.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased breath sounds at the bases, L>R, could lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Septicemia: The patient's decreased white blood cell count could lead to further complications, such as septicemia and the need for antibiotics.
8. Bleeding: The patient's decreased platelet count could lead to further complications, such as bleeding and the need for transfusions.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her quality of life."
