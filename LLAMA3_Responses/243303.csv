   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  71 yo F w/ remote breast ca s/p mastectomy
   and chemo and recent dx of esoph SCca with TE fistula s/p esophageal
   and bronchus Y stent 2 wks ago.  Admitted [**8-20**] for palliative chemo and
   transferred to ICU yesterday w/ resp distress (desat to 75%, BP
   stable but tachy to 160, refusing sx) for emergent bronch to eval stent
   patency. She remains comfortable from resp standpoint since her
   bronchoscopy. She has had transient agitation/confusion overnight.

   Her respiratory distress was most likely from plugging and has resolved
   post-bronch. Agree with plan to continue chest PT, pulm toilet, nebs
   with bronchodilators and mucolytics.  IP service is following. Continue
   moxiflox through [**8-23**] for prophylaxis after stent placement.  She
   continues to have a leukocytosos but remains af w/o obvious infectious
   etiology. Will f/u on pending cx's.  She remains tachycardic, near her
   baseline. Hypovolemia and possibly pain are likely factors. Continue
   gentle fluids and resume TFs.  Her agitation and confusion is better.
   If [**Name (NI) 4467**], would use haldol rather than benzos.  Additional onc
   recs regarding her plan for pallitaitve chemo/c/s rad onc. Zofran for
   nausea.  Will restart fent patch and half dose methadone for chronic
   pain.  ICU:  R portacath, sq hep, PPI, full code, which will continue
   to be addressed with onc team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, or even death.
3. Agitation and confusion: The patient's agitation and confusion may be related to medication side effects, pain, or underlying medical conditions. If not addressed, this could lead to further complications, such as falls, injuries, or even aspiration.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to agitation, pain, or hypovolemia. If left untreated, this could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia may be related to inadequate fluid resuscitation or underlying medical conditions. If left untreated, this could lead to organ dysfunction, hypotension, or even circulatory collapse.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to medication side effects, pain, or underlying medical conditions. If left untreated, this could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or even aspiration.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain is not adequately controlled, which may lead to further complications, such as agitation, delirium, or even organ dysfunction.
8. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and recent bronchoscopy may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, or even death.
9. Malignancy: The patient's esophageal cancer and recent stent placement may increase the risk of complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's cachexia and recent tube feeding discontinuation may indicate malnutrition, which could lead to further complications, such as organ dysfunction, weakness, or even death.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Respiratory support: Continue chest PT, pulm toilet, nebs with bronchodilators and mucolytics to maintain respiratory function.
2. Infection control: Monitor for signs of infection, and consider antibiotics if indicated.
3. Agitation and confusion management: Use haldol for agitation, and consider benzodiazepines as needed.
4. Tachycardia management: Use gentle fluids and consider restarting tube feeds to address hypovolemia and pain.
5. Pain management: Restart methadone and fentanyl patches to adequately control pain.
6. Nausea and vomiting management: Use zofran and IV PPI to control nausea and vomiting.
7. Infection prophylaxis: Continue moxifloxacin through [**8-23**] for prophylaxis after stent placement.
8. Malignancy management: Consult with oncology to develop a plan for palliative chemotherapy and radiation oncology.
9. Malnutrition management: Restart tube feeds and consider nutritional supplements to address malnutrition.
10. ICU care: Continue to monitor the patient's condition in the ICU and adjust the care plan as needed."

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer who was admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and underwent an emergent bronchoscopy. She is currently in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and has a history of chronic pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has been prescribed various medications, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antihistamines, but is currently experiencing respiratory distress and agitation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of factors, including upper airway obstruction, mucus plugging, and malposition or obstruction of the Y-stent. If left untreated, this could lead to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to reactive leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis or a secondary infection. If left untreated, this could lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ dysfunction.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be due to medication-induced paradoxical reaction or underlying psychological factors. If left untreated, this could lead to further complications, such as self-harm or injury to others.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to agitation, respiratory distress, or underlying cardiovascular disease. If left untreated, this could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or underlying gastrointestinal disease. If left untreated, this could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.
6. Pain management: The patient's chronic pain may be undertreated, which could lead to further complications, such as decreased mobility, decreased appetite, and decreased quality of life.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may be undertreated, which could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, dry skin, and decreased cognitive function.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal symptoms to prevent further complications and improve her overall quality of life."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing agitation, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 97.9°C (36.6°C)
* HR: 135-149 bpm
* BP: 169/98-170/127 mmHg
* RR: 21-31 insp/min
* SpO2: 99%

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, and morphine, and has been experiencing respiratory distress, which is being managed with nebs, mucinex, and pulmonary toilet. The patient's WBC count is 17.0 K/uL, and her Hct is 36.1%. The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 17.0 K/uL
* Hct: 36.1%
* Plt: 587 K/uL
* Cr: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 162 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.4/52.5/1.1, Differential-Neuts: 84.0%, Lymph: 10.1%, Mono: 5.4%, Eos: 0.3%, Ca++: 10.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory Distress: Continue nebs, mucinex, and pulmonary toilet, and closely monitor respiratory status.
* Leukocytosis: Complete the 2-week course of Moxifloxacin and hold on additional antibiotics for now. Trend WBC and follow up with BCx, UA/UCx.
* Agitation: Use Haldol 0.25 prn for agitation and re-start fentanyl patch and home methadone dose.
* Tachycardia: Manage with IV fluids, gentle 250cc NS bolus, and maintenance fluids. Restart tube feeds today if no further need for bronchoscopy.
* Esophageal Ca: Consult Rad/Onc for starting XRT.
* Nausea/vomiting: Use Zofran prn and IV PPI.
* Pain management: Hold pain meds given respiratory distress for now. Restart methadone at home dose and fentanyl patches.
* HTN: Continue home dose of Procardia.
* Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of Synthroid.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. She has a history of eophageal cancer, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Currently, she is experiencing respiratory failure, acute pain, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Her vital signs include a temperature of 97.9°C, blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg, heart rate of 124 bpm, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a nasal cannula in place.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, erythromycin base, penicillins, and phenothiazines. She has also had an anaphylactic reaction to iodine and aspirin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, frail-appearing individual with warm and well-perfused skin, anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, and a patent airway. Her cardiac examination reveals a tachycardic, regular rate, and her lung examination reveals coarse rhonchi and episodes of stridorous upper airway sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, a platelet count of 587 K/uL, and a creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient will undergo emergent bronchoscopy to evaluate the cause of her respiratory distress. She will receive oxygen therapy and will be closely monitored for any changes in her respiratory status.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to reactive leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis. She will be monitored for any signs of infection and will receive antibiotics if necessary.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is likely due to medication-induced agitation. She will be given haloperidol as needed for agitation.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to agitation and respiratory distress. She will be given a gentle 250cc NS bolus and will receive maintenance fluids.
5. Esophageal cancer: The patient will continue to receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy for her esophageal cancer.
6. Nausea and vomiting: The patient will receive antiemetics and IV PPI for her persistent nausea and vomiting.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain management will be restarted once her respiratory distress is stabilized.
8. Hypertension: The patient will continue to receive her home dose of procardia for her hypertension.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient will continue to receive her home dose of synthroid for her hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if she does not receive adequate oxygen therapy or if her respiratory distress is not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing an infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and leukocytosis increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient's respiratory distress and leukocytosis increase her risk of developing a pneumothorax.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's esophageal cancer and nausea and vomiting increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critical care patient in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has been experiencing episodes of nausea and vomiting, which have been managed with antiemetic medications. The patient has also been experiencing severe pain, which has been managed with opioids.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.0 g/dL, and the platelet count is 505 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and the glucose level is 142 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute pain, and tachycardia. The patient's pain is managed with opioids, and the patient's tachycardia is managed with anti-anxiety medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the patient's oxygen saturation drops or if the patient develops respiratory distress.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis can lead to sepsis, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Pain: The patient's pain is managed with opioids, but the patient's pain can worsen if the patient's medication is inadequate or if the patient develops tolerance to the medication.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia can worsen if the patient's heart rate increases further, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis can indicate an infection, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding if the patient undergoes surgical or invasive procedures.
7. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which can indicate kidney damage. The patient's kidney damage can worsen if the patient's creatinine level increases further.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is slightly elevated, which can increase the risk of hyperglycemia and its complications.

In summary, the patient is a critical care patient in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute pain, and tachycardia. Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain, tachycardia, infection, bleeding, kidney damage, and hyperglycemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 123 bpm (95-137 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 160/81 mmHg (97-172/113 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (12-29 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Agitated at times, thin and frail appearing
* Skin: Warm and well-perfused, no rashes visible
* HEENT: Anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, and MMM
* Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular rate, S1/S2, no murmurs
* Lung: Coarse rhonchi, episodes of stridorous upper airway sounds
* Abdomen: Nondistended, +BS, diffusely tender, no rebound/guarding
* M/S: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, no obvious deformities
* Pulses: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally
* Neuro: Moving all extremities spontaneously, no obvious focal deficits

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 17.0 and 16.4 K/uL
* Hct: 36.1 and 33.9%
* Plt: 587 and 505 K/uL
* Cr: 0.4 and 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 162 and 142 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain control
* Haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation
* Heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient is also receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery and is being monitored for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are experiencing stridorous upper airway sounds, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
* Pain control: The patient is receiving various pain medications, but their pain is still not well-controlled, which may lead to further complications.
* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate cardiac complications or other underlying conditions.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and presence of coarse rhonchi in their lung examination may indicate an infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diffusely tender abdomen and presence of blood in their stool may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding."

   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress and emergent bronch.
   .
   PLAN:
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with y-stent and presents with acute
   hypoxia. Pt with evidence of upper airway obstruction on exam
   concerning for mucus plugging given secreations and cough or
   malfunction of the Y-stent. Either malposition or obstruction.  Other
   possibilites, but less likely include PE (pt with underlying
   malignancy, but hypoxia was transient), pneumonia, PTX less likely
   given uncchanged CXR. Pt is able to maintain states at 100%.
   - cont nebs (albuterol, ipratropium, mucomyst)
   - cont mucinex [**Hospital1 **]
   - pulmonary toliet
   - Moxifloxacin per prior discharge for 2 more days
   - closely monitor resp status
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Pt has been afebrile. DDx inlcudes reactive
   leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis. CXR did not show acute
   infiltrate concerning for pna.
   - pt was previously on Moxifloxacin at time of discharge, will complete
   2 week course. Hold on additional abx for now
   - cont to trend WBC
   - f/u BCx, UA/UCx
   .
   #Agitation: Possible medication induced. Pt with paradoxical reaction
   to ativan in the past per husband.  She did receive BZD this AM.
   - haldol 0.25prn for agitation
   - re-started fentanyl patch and
 home methadone dose
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Likely agitation and resp distress contributing. Pt was
   tachy on admission to 110-120's. Also likely dry given poor po intake.
   No ECG in record, but reportly sinus tach.
   - IV fluids, gentle 250cc NS bolus then maintence
   -will re-start tube feeds today if no further need for bronchoscopy
   .
   # Esophageal Ca: Chemotherapy per primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 876**]. Plan was
   to start chemo/XRT this admission.  Will follow-up with Onc.
   -consult Rad/Onc for starting XRT

* Skin: warm and well-perfused, no rashes visible
* HEENT: anicteric sclera, pink conjunctiva, patent nares, MMM
* Cardiac: tachycardic, regular rate, S1/S2, no murmurs
* Lung: coarse rhonchi, episodes of stridorous upper airway sounds
* Abdomen: nondistended, +BS, diffusely tender, no rebound/guarding, midline staples and j-tube in place
* M/S: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no obvious deformities
* Pulses: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally
* Neuro: moving all extremities spontaneously, no obvious focal deficits

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory distress: continue nebs (albuterol, ipratropium, mucomyst), continue mucinex, pulmonary toilet, and moxifloxacin
* Leukocytosis: trend WBC, follow-up BCx, UA/UCx
* Agitation: hold haldol, restart fentanyl patch and home methadone dose
* Tachycardia: IV fluids, gentle 250cc NS bolus then maintenance
* Esophageal Ca: chemotherapy per primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 876**], consult Rad/Onc for starting XRT
* Nausea/vomiting: zofran prn, IV PPI
* Pain management: hold pain meds given respiratory distress for now, restart methadone at home dose, fentanyl patches
* HTN: continue home dose procardia
* Hypothyroidism: continue home dose synthroid

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening hypoxia, respiratory acidosis
* Leukocytosis: sepsis, pneumonia
* Agitation: worsening agitation, delirium
* Tachycardia: cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure
* Nausea/vomiting: dehydration, electrolyte imbalance
* Pain management: inadequate pain control, respiratory depression
* HTN: worsening hypertension, cardiac failure
* Hypothyroidism: worsening hypothyroidism, myxedema

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing episodes of nausea and vomiting, and has had a dystonic reaction to Reglan. She has also been experiencing pain, tachycardia, and delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's cough and upper airway obstruction may increase the risk of pneumonia, which can be a serious complication.
3. Mucus plugging: The patient's thick secretions and cough may lead to mucus plugging, which can further exacerbate respiratory distress.
4. Malposition or obstruction of the Y-stent: The patient's Y-stent may be malpositioned or obstructed, which can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's underlying malignancy and hypoxia may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or inflammation, which can worsen respiratory distress and other complications.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be caused by pain, ICU environment, and polypharmacy, which can lead to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by pain, anxiety, and respiratory distress, which can lead to increased cardiac workload and risk of cardiac complications.
9. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition, which can worsen respiratory distress and other complications.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen respiratory distress, fatigue, and other symptoms.

The plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive respiratory support, including nebulization, mucinex, and pulmonary toilet.
2. Pain control: The patient will receive pain medication, including Dilaudid and methadone, to manage her pain.
3. Delirium management: The patient will receive Haldol PRN for agitation and restraints will be used to prevent falls.
4. Leukocytosis management: The patient's leukocytosis will be trended, and she will be followed up with blood cultures and urine cultures.
5. Esophageal cancer treatment: The patient will receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy as per her primary oncologist's plan.
6. Nutrition: The patient will receive tube feeds to manage her nutrition.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and controlled.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory distress, pain, delirium, and other complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her outcome."
