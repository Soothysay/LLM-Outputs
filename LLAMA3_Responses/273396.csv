You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke, treated with 50% dose systemic tPA and local intrarterial tPA. She is intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Her current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 72 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 126/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

She has a right-sided weakness, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 26. Her laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose: 184 mg/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.5%
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Neurological checks every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, and then every hour
* Goal systolic blood pressure < 180 mmHg with prn labetalol
* Hold other anti-hypertensives except metoprolol
* Repeat NCHCT within 1 hour post-IA procedure and again at 9 am tomorrow
* MRI to assess extent of infarct
* TTE
* Check A1c and FLP
* Hold ASA and Plavix for at least 24 hours post-tPA
* Cont statin
* Tylenol and ISS for pain
* Hold metformin post-contrast
* If any neurological change, obtain STAT non-contrast head CT

Potential medical complications:

* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but the goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure < 180 mmHg. If not controlled, this could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral edema, and increased risk of bleeding.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 184 mg/dL, which is above the normal range. This could lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and increased risk of infections.
* Bleeding: The patient has received large volumes of blood during the angiogram procedure, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of hematocrit and platelet count is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient is intubated and sedated, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
* Cerebral edema: The patient has a history of stroke, which may increase the risk of cerebral edema. Close monitoring of neurological status and head CT scans is necessary to detect any signs of cerebral edema.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute left middle cerebral artery (L MCA) stroke, following a 50% dose of systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and local intrarterial tPA. She has a history of aphasia and right-sided weakness. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of unknown. She has a right-sided weakness in her upper and lower extremities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/48 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on 50% FiO2. Her laboratory results show hyperglycemia, with a glucose level of 184 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes penicillins allergy, hydrochlorothiazide allergy, and GI irritation from ibuprofen. She is currently receiving metoprolol, hydralazine, and famotidine.

Potential medical complications:

1. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and she is at risk for further neurological deterioration.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but she is at risk for hypertension and cardiovascular complications.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and sedated, and she is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung injury.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is NPO, and she is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal complications: The patient is receiving large volumes of fluids, and she is at risk for acute kidney injury.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient has received large volumes of blood, and she is at risk for bleeding complications.
7. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

Recommendations:
