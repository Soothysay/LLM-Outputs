You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse, presenting with alcohol intoxication and withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations and agitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.3-9.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 255-274 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 91-116 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal

The patient's medical history includes a history of ETOH withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient is currently receiving IV diazepam for benzodiazepine withdrawal and has a pending SW consult.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of ETOH withdrawal seizures, and the current benzodiazepine withdrawal may lead to seizures.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient's history of DTs and current symptoms of hallucinations and agitation suggest a risk of developing DTs.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap and elevated lactate levels may indicate metabolic acidosis, which needs to be closely monitored and treated with bicarbonate therapy if necessary.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg suggest a risk of developing hypertensive crisis.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, may be imbalanced due to ETOH withdrawal and require close monitoring and replacement therapy if necessary.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and elevated lactate levels may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Neurological deficits: The patient's extra-axial hemorrhage and elevated lactate levels may indicate a risk of neurological deficits, which need to be closely monitored and treated promptly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing IV diazepam for benzodiazepine withdrawal
* Correcting electrolyte deficiencies
* Checking dilantin level and confirming outpatient dose
* SW consult
* Monitoring for seizures and DTs
* Monitoring for infection and metabolic acidosis
* Monitoring for hypertension and electrolyte imbalance
* Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and neurological deficits"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of ethanol withdrawal. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been marked by increasing agitation, refractory hallucinations, and a CIWA scale of 30. The patient was switched from oral ativan to IV diazepam to manage their symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their agitation and inability to assess certain vital signs. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.3, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of 255, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration, and they are receiving IV diazepam for symptom management. They are also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening ethanol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and agitation.
2. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheter placement.
4. Stress ulcer bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged use of corticosteroids and anticoagulation.
5. Electrolyte imbalances or hypoglycemia due to inadequate nutrition and glycemic control.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac complications due to electrolyte imbalances or medication interactions.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing their ethanol withdrawal symptoms, preventing and treating potential complications, and ensuring adequate nutrition and glycemic control."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an alcohol withdrawal patient who is experiencing refractory hallucinations and agitation. The patient was switched from oral ativan to IV diazepam due to increased agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85-110 bpm, blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.3-9.5 K/uL
* Hct: 35.7-32.9%
* Plt: 255-274 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL

* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.4/31.4/1.2, Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their agitation and hallucinations, but they are not assessed for peripheral vascular, respiratory, or neurologic exam.

The patient has a PICC line placed, and they are receiving IV diazepam for agitation and hallucinations. They are also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Increased agitation and hallucinations
* Seizures
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Infection due to the PICC line
* Bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Renal failure due to electrolyte imbalance
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg. He is receiving IV diazepam for ETOH withdrawal and has a PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to ETOH withdrawal, and benzodiazepines are being used to manage this risk. If seizures occur, dilantin may be considered.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap with elevated lactate, likely due to ETOH and starvation ketosis. IV fluids with normal saline are being used for hydration, and thiamine will be administered before glucose.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently under control, but he is being held on antihypertensives due to his ETOH withdrawal.
4. Infection: The patient has a risk of infection due to his ETOH abuse and withdrawal symptoms.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a nasal cannula in place. He has diminished breath sounds, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unclear, and he is at risk for neurological complications due to his ETOH withdrawal and potential seizures.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has electrolyte deficiencies, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which need to be corrected.
8. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, with a positive fluid balance over the past 24 hours, which may lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to his ETOH withdrawal, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) abuse, presenting with ETOH withdrawal, and currently experiencing benzodiazepine-induced agitation and refractory hallucinations.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a PICC line in place, and his fluid balance is being monitored. He is receiving IV diazepam for agitation and hallucinations, and his CIWA scale is 30.

Laboratory results show an anion gap with elevated lactate, likely due to ETOH and starvation ketosis. His white blood cell count is 8.3, and his platelet count is 255. His creatinine is 0.7, and his glucose is 116 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of seizures, and his outpatient medications include dilantin, which is unclear why he is taking it for ETOH-related seizures. He also has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently being managed with CIWA.

The patient has a right hip pain with erythema, warmth, and tenderness, which is concerning for an infected joint. He does not have any obvious neurologic deficits, and his head CT is negative for bleeding or artifact.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and his current benzodiazepine treatment may not be sufficient to prevent further seizures.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap and elevated lactate levels may indicate a risk for metabolic acidosis, which could worsen his condition.
3. Infection: The patient's right hip pain and erythema suggest the possibility of an infected joint, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current blood pressure management may require close monitoring to prevent complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and chloride, may require close monitoring and correction to prevent complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may require close monitoring to prevent respiratory failure.
7. Neurologic deficits: The patient's head CT is negative, but his neurologic status may require close monitoring to prevent deficits.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including seizures, metabolic acidosis, infection, hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, respiratory failure, and neurologic deficits. Close monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary to prevent adverse outcomes."

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old man, is admitted to the ICU with ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal. He was initially started on IV Valium, but due to rising CIWA scores, the medication was converted back to IV Valium. The patient has a PICC line in place, and his vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/82 mmHg. He is receiving IV fluids and has a positive fluid balance. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal electrolyte levels. He is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of seizure activity due to ethanol withdrawal and high CIWA scores.
2. Potential for bleeding complications due to prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.
3. Risk of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to IV fluids and potential kidney injury.
4. Increased risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and potential for catheter-related infections.
5. Risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia, due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and potential for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential for gastrointestinal mucosal damage.
7. Risk of kidney injury due to IV fluids and potential for acute kidney injury.
8. Potential for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, due to electrolyte imbalances and potential for cardiac injury.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's ETOH withdrawal symptoms are being managed with IV Valium, and his electrolyte levels are being monitored. He is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored for any changes, and his medication regimen will be adjusted as necessary. He will continue to receive IV fluids and have his vital signs closely monitored."

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with alcohol intoxication who is now experiencing withdrawal symptoms. He was started on IV Valium, which was effective in managing his symptoms. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/82 mmHg. He has a history of penicillin allergy and an unknown rash. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for agitation overnight. He has a PICC line in place and is receiving IV fluids. His labs are stable, with a normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Seizures: The patient's history of ethanol withdrawal and use of IV Valium puts him at risk for seizures.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation and disheveled appearance suggest the possibility of delirium, which can be a complication of ethanol withdrawal.
3. Infection: The patient's history of unknown rash and penicillin allergy increases his risk of infection.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and his oxygen saturation is 94%, which may indicate early signs of respiratory distress.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which may indicate the need for further fluid management.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and phosphorus, are slightly abnormal, which may require further monitoring and management.
7. Thiamine deficiency: The patient is receiving thiamine supplementation, but it is possible that he may have a deficiency, which can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy.
8. Head injury: The patient's head CT is pending, which may reveal a head injury that requires further management.
9. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his immobility and the use of SQ UF Heparin prophylaxis.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving PPI prophylaxis, but stress ulcers can still occur, especially in critically ill patients."

   changes as described above
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 61 y.o.m. with ETOH abuse, h/o withdrawal seizures and
   DT
s who presents with alcohol intoxication and ? seizures in ED.
   # ETOH withdrawal
 Last drink Monday afternoon at some point.  Chronic
   alcoholic.   Serum/urine tox screens otherwise negative, no electrolyte
   abnormalities or evidence of infections.  Lactic acidosis on admission
   likely due to alcohol and poor nutrition, resolved with IVF.  No
   evidence of seizures yet, but has had alcoholi hallucinosis.  His CIWA
   scales have been under 10 for the past 24hrs.
   -Can likely d/c diazapam
   -Keep K and Mg >4 and 2 respectively
   -continue thiamine, folic acid, MVI
   -SW consulting
   # H/O Seizures
 Per records, has a history of childhood seizures for
   which he takes dilantin.  Dilantin level <0.6, so unclear if he is
   actually taking this.
   -Consider restarting dilantin today
   # HTN
 On atenolol at home, but unknown dose.   Holding
   antihypertensives in the setting of benzodiazapines.
   -Consider restarting once stable off diazapam.
   # Right hip pain
 Hip film negative for acute fracture.
   -oxycodone prn pain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse, who presented with alcohol intoxication and suspected seizures in the emergency department. He has been in the ICU for 24 hours and has been receiving treatment for ETOH withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 132/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His physical examination is notable for right hip pain with palpation.

The patient has been receiving treatment for ETOH withdrawal, including diazepam for breakthrough symptoms, and has been weaned off benzodiazepines. His CIWA scale has been under 10 for the past 24 hours, indicating that his withdrawal symptoms are well-controlled.

The patient has a history of childhood seizures, for which he takes dilantin. However, his dilantin level is less than 0.6, suggesting that he may not be taking the medication as prescribed. Consideration is being given to restarting dilantin today.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, for which he takes atenolol at home. However, the dose is unknown, and antihypertensives are being held in the setting of benzodiazepine use. Consideration is being given to restarting atenolol once the patient is stable off benzodiazepines.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 270 K/uL. His creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and his glucose level is 128 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Seizures: The patient has a history of childhood seizures and has been experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which may increase his risk of seizure activity.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving treatment for ETOH withdrawal, which may increase his blood pressure.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to his poor nutrition and prolonged hospitalization.
* Medication side effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including benzodiazepines, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants, which may have side effects that need to be monitored.

In conclusion, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse who is being treated for ETOH withdrawal in the ICU. He has a stable vital signs and is receiving treatment for his withdrawal symptoms. However, he is at risk for potential medical complications, including seizures, hypertension, infection, nutritional deficiencies, and medication side effects."

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, seizure disorder, and hypertension, currently admitted to the ICU for ethanol withdrawal. He has been receiving diazepam for breakthrough symptoms and has had a negative repeat NCHCT. His CIWA scale has been under 10 for the past 24 hours. He has a history of childhood seizures and is not taking his dilantin medication, as evidenced by a dilantin level <0.6. He is also experiencing right hip pain, which is being managed with oxycodone as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: Despite the patient's CIWA scale being under 10, there is still a risk of seizure recurrence, especially given his history of seizure disorder and recent ethanol withdrawal.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been receiving IV fluids, which may lead to hypoglycemia if not properly monitored.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels should be closely monitored to ensure they remain within normal ranges.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of poor nutrition and lactic acidosis, which may increase his risk of infection.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his prolonged immobility in the ICU.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's prolonged use of benzodiazepines may increase his risk of stress ulcer.
7. VAP: The patient's use of a PICC line and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of VAP.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed.
9. Right hip pain: The patient's right hip pain may worsen if not properly managed, potentially leading to further complications.
10. Dilantin toxicity: If the patient's dilantin level is not closely monitored, there is a risk of toxicity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a chief complaint of ETOH withdrawal. He has undergone a head CT scan, which showed a small linear area of high attenuation adjacent to the lateral right frontal lobe, but this area is no longer visualized. The patient has been receiving Valium for ETOH withdrawal and has been conversant and not tremulous. However, he is complaining of severe diarrhea and has a fever.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/94 mmHg. He is receiving fluid and electrolyte support, as well as medications for ETOH withdrawal and diarrhea.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis, with a normal electrolyte panel. His coagulation studies show a slightly prolonged PT and PTT, but a normal INR.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is being treated for ETOH withdrawal with Valium, and will be converted back to equivalent home Ativan and kept on CIWA. He will also receive repletion of electrolytes, continue Thiamine, and MVI. The patient will be consulted with Social Work and investigated for rehab if amenable.

The patient's diarrhea is being worked up for possible ETOH-related causes, and anti-diarrheal medication is being given pending the results.

The patient's seizure history is also being addressed, with a plan to restart home Dilantin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal seizures: The patient's history of seizures and the current ETOH withdrawal may put him at risk for seizures.
2. Diarrhea and dehydration: The patient's severe diarrhea may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and diarrhea may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
4. Blood clotting disorders: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may indicate a blood clotting disorder, which needs to be monitored and treated if necessary.
5. Thiamine deficiency: The patient's history of ETOH use and the current use of Thiamine may indicate a risk of Thiamine deficiency, which needs to be monitored and treated if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 61-year-old man admitted to the ICU with ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal. He has a history of ETOH intoxication, and his withdrawal symptoms are being managed with Valium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/94 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of diarrhea, which is being investigated for potential causes, including Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). He also has a history of seizures, which are being managed with Dilantin.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.3-10.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 255-270 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 6-10.7 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 28 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is notable for sinus tachycardia and absent peripheral pulses.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* ETOH withdrawal seizures
* Diarrhea-related dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
* Seizure-related complications, such as falls or head trauma
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction
* Infections, such as C. diff or other opportunistic pathogens
* Thiamine deficiency-related complications, such as Wernicke's encephalopathy

The patient's plan of care includes continued management of his ETOH withdrawal symptoms, repletion of electrolytes, and investigation of his diarrhea. He will also be consulted with social work and rehabilitation services if amenable."

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old man with alcohol intoxication now with withdrawal
   1. ETOH withdrawl: po Valium with TID standing and break through by
   CIWA.  Total 50 mg Valium yesterday.
   Will convert back to equivalent - home Ativan and keep on CIWA.
   Repleting lytes, continue Thiamine, MVI.
   Will consult Social work and investigate rehab if amenable
   2. Diarrhea: question ETOH related, check C diff. Ok to give
   3. Seziures: since childhood restart home dilantin.
   4. Access: able to get PICC and functions well

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man admitted to the ICU for ETOH withdrawal. He has been receiving treatment for withdrawal symptoms, including Valium, and has been repleted with electrolytes and vitamins. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/94 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. His laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. He has a history of seizures, and his medications include Valium, Ativan, and Dilantin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient is at risk for continued withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may be related to ETOH withdrawal or an underlying infection, such as C. difficile. He is also at risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase his risk for bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures such as PICC line placement.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for continued seizures, particularly if his medications are not optimized.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and he may be at risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly if his withdrawal symptoms worsen.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies, particularly if he is unable to tolerate oral nutrition or if his gastrointestinal symptoms persist.
7. Delirium: The patient may be at risk for developing delirium, particularly if his withdrawal symptoms worsen or if he has underlying cognitive impairment."
