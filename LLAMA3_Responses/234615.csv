   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male diabetic, former smoker, with DM2, CAD, hyperlipidemia
   who presents from [**Hospital6 1986**] with likely large territory
   NSTEMI. Patient is s/p cardiac catherization at [**Hospital3 337**] which
   demonstrates diffuse 3 vessel disease being evaluated for CABG.
   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] eptifibatide, continue heparin gtt, continue ASA
   - Change simvastatin 40mg to atorvastatin 80mg
   - start beta blocker given HTN and significant coronary artery disease
   - Holding ACE-I given borderline blood pressure, but can consider
   low-dose of this in AM if blood pressure is stable.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from cardiothoracic surgery aware, and plan to review
   angiography films with team in AM
   - f/u surgery recs regarding plans
   - Trend biomarkers, ECG, telemetry
   # Respiratory failure - Likely CHF as below, treat with diuresis, will
   hold antibiotics as no clear infiltrate on chest x-ray. Patient febrile
   overnight to 100 with leukocytosis. On initial chest x-ray no clear
   infiltrate.
   -          f/u final read chest x-ray
   -          consider Levoquin for treatment of community acquired
   pneumonia if clinically suspect
   .
   # PUMP:  Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF, unclear
   whether he also has chronic component.  Elevated PCWP on cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Diuresis for I/O -500cc-1000cc as tolerated by blood pressure,
   furosemide 20mg IV PRN
   - cont aspirin, statin, plavix, beta blocker
   - Start ACE-I this morning is pressure tolerates
   - Repeat echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline
   - Holding ACE-I given blood pressure, consider restarting if BP stable
   and creatinine stable.
   - Obtain records from PCP if able
   - Monitor electrolytes, renally dose medications
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm.
   # Diabetes mellitus - holding metformin and giving insulin sliding
   scale while in house

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia, who was admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have diffuse 3-vessel disease. He is currently in the ICU with acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, acute systolic CHF, acute renal failure, and is being treated with various medications.

24-Hour Events:

The patient had an episode of increased work of respiration overnight, which was treated with a non-rebreather mask and oxygen saturation of 100%. An ABG was obtained, and a repeat chest x-ray is pending. The patient's fluid overload appears to be worsening.

Vital Signs:

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 95/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 100%

Hemodynamic Monitoring:

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows:

* Cardiac index: 2.2 L/min/m2
* Systemic vascular resistance: 2,146 dynes/s/cm5
* Pulmonary artery pressure: 25/15 mmHg
* Central venous pressure: 10 mmHg

Fluid Balance:

The patient's fluid balance shows:

* Total input: 22 mL
* Total output: 201 mL
* Balance: -84 mL

Respiratory Support:

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and a ventilator set at 550 mL with a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O.

Labs/Radiology:

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.9 x 109/L
* Hematocrit: 34.6%
* Platelet count: 329 x 109/L
* Troponin-T: 1.76 ng/mL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute coronary syndrome: continue eptifibatide, heparin, and ASA
* Respiratory failure: treat with diuresis, hold antibiotics until chest x-ray results are available
* Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF: diuresis, furosemide, and ACE-I as tolerated
* Acute renal failure: hold ACE-I, monitor electrolytes and creatinine
* Diabetes mellitus: hold metformin, give insulin sliding scale

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the patient's current condition, potential medical complications include:

* Worsening of acute coronary syndrome
* Development of cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory failure due to worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia or sepsis
* Sepsis due to pneumonia or other infections
* Metabolic complications due to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to diuretic therapy or other medications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse 3-vessel disease, and is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has required non-rebreather oxygen and has been placed on mechanical ventilation. A chest x-ray showed no clear infiltrate, but the patient has febrile leukocytosis.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient has elevated troponin levels and a large CK leak, suggesting a large territory NSTEMI.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF: The patient has elevated PCWP on cardiac catheterization and is being treated with diuresis and vasodilators.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and it is unclear whether this is due to baseline kidney disease or acute kidney injury.
5. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular block and is at risk for bradycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not treated promptly, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential for baseline kidney disease increase his risk for acute kidney injury, which can worsen his cardiovascular and respiratory status.
4. Infection: The patient's febrile leukocytosis and respiratory failure increase his risk for infection, particularly pneumonia.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases his risk for bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, former smoking, CAD, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to the ICU from the CCU after experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. He had undergone cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated diffuse 3-vessel disease, and is being evaluated for CABG. He is currently receiving eptifibatide, heparin, ASA, and atorvastatin. His condition has deteriorated overnight, with increased work of breathing, requiring placement on a non-rebreather mask with 100% oxygen saturation and an ABG obtained. He received 40mg IV lasix with good urine output and improved breathing.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with worsening pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing. He may require further diuresis and consideration of antibiotics for possible community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF may lead to further cardiac decompensation, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's Cr level is stable at 1.4, but his baseline renal function is unclear. He may require further monitoring of electrolytes and renally dosed medications.
4. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's large territory NSTEMI may be complicated by further cardiac events, including recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or death.
5. Infections: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition and increase the risk of complications.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin and eptifibatide may increase his risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, or hematemesis.

Further recommendations:

1. Repeat CXR to assess for worsening pulmonary edema.
2. Decrease nitroglycerin infusion to give more room in BP for diuresis.
3. Goal I/O -1-2L with prn lasix.
4. Consider Levaquin for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia if clinically suspected.
5. Continue diuresis for I/O -1-2L as tolerated by blood pressure.
6. Monitor electrolytes, renally dose medications, and obtain records from PCP if able.
7. Repeat echocardiogram in AM to assess for cardiac function and potential complications.
8. Continue aspirin, statin, and beta blocker therapy.
9. Hold ACE-I and monitor blood pressure.
10. Consider low-dose ACE-I if blood pressure is stable and not contraindicated."
