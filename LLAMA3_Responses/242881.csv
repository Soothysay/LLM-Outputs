   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema, intubated for airway protection.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed
   - consider ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to
   evaluate for lower airway edema
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, intubated for airway protection. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and lisinopril, which may have triggered the allergic reaction. Her current vital signs are: Tmax 37.7°C, Tcurrent 36.2°C, HR 80 bpm, BP 130/72 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 98%. She has mild facial swelling, prominent swollen tongue, and + swelling anterior neck. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute on chronic kidney disease, LUE swelling, hyponatremia, hypertension, and a history of seizures. She is currently receiving IV solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid, as well as mechanical ventilation and fentanyl/versed sedation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Lower airway edema: The patient's intubation was done for airway protection, and there is a risk of developing lower airway edema, which may require further evaluation with a scope or CT scan.
2. Renal failure: The patient's Cr level is 1.6 mg/dL, and she has a history of acute on chronic kidney disease. Further monitoring is necessary to prevent renal failure.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is trending up from 127 to 133, but it is still below normal. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent hyponatremia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's BP is currently normotensive, but there is a risk of developing hypertension, which may require further management.
5. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and it is necessary to continue dilantin therapy to prevent further seizures.
6. DVT: The patient's LUE swelling is negative for DVT, but further monitoring is necessary to prevent DVT.
7. VAP: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring and prophylaxis are necessary to prevent VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation
   for at least 24 hours
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who presented with angioedema. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and had stopped taking lisinopril, which was listed as an allergy for unclear reasons. The patient was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.7°C, Tcurrent of 36.2°C, HR of 80 bpm, BP of 130/72 mmHg, and SpO2 of 98%. Her fluid balance is being monitored, with a total input of 1,520 mL and a total output of 2,546 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.5-10.8 K/uL
* Hct: 30.4-30.6%
* Plt: 221-222 K/uL
* Cr: 1.4-1.9 mg/dL
* TCO2: 19-23 mmHg
* Glucose: 139-173 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.2/38.3/1.2, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
* Cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
* Cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
* Cont mechanical ventilation
* Change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation for at least 24 hours
* When ready for extubation, anesthesia at bedside due to difficult intubation
* No evidence to suggest infectious etiology, so antibiotics will be held off
* Patient should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation
* Cardiovascular instability due to pre-existing CAD and HTN
* Renal failure or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to dehydration and decreased PO intake
* Hyponatremia or electrolyte imbalances due to hypovolemic hyponatremia
* Angioedema recurrence or progression due to unknown precipitating factors
* Allergic reactions to medications or food
* Infection or sepsis due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69.6 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of respiratory failure, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has a history of shellfish allergy and is allergic to Bactrim. He is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg. He is receiving fluids through an 18-gauge and 20-gauge IV line.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5-10.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.1-10.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 221-222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4-1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19-23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 139-173 mg/dL

The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his inability to protect his airway, and he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis prevention.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway puts him at risk for aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase his risk for sepsis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention, but he is still at risk for developing DVT due to his prolonged immobility.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and immunosuppressed state."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation
   for at least 24 hours
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who presents with angioedema, acute on chronic kidney disease, and hyponatremia. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and had a history of stopping lisinopril, which may have contributed to the development of angioedema. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving IV medications for sedation, anti-anxiety, and antihistamine. Her labs show elevated creatinine, potassium, and magnesium levels, and she is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is 1.9, indicating potential AKI. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the injury and potential need for dialysis.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are elevated, which may require correction to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications.
4. Infection: The patient's exposure to levofloxacin and history of stopping lisinopril may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly a bacterial infection.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may lead to fluid overload and increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged intubation may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-calorie malnutrition.
7. Sedation-related complications: The patient's sedation regimen may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and other complications.
8. Angioedema-related complications: The patient's angioedema may lead to airway compromise, respiratory failure, and other complications if not managed promptly and effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation
   - change sedation to fentanyl/versed as will likely require intubation
   for at least 24 hours
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive, likely effect from propofol.
   - will add back HCTZ when BP allows
   # Convulsive disorder: continue dilantin
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   # Access: PIV x 2

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who presents with angioedema, acute kidney injury, and hyponatremia. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and had stopped taking lisinopril, which may have contributed to the development of angioedema. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving IV solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid. Her creatinine level has improved from 1.9 to 1.6, and her sodium level is trending up from 127 to 133. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and HTN, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury and hyponatremia, which increases the risk of renal failure and the need for dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia, given the presence of a nasotracheal tube and the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to the use of anticholinergic medications and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
7. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures, given her history of convulsive disorder and the use of sedative medications."

   Angioedema presumed secondary to ACE.  Very difficult nasotracheal
   intubation.  Remains intubated for airway protection.  On steroids,
   antihistamines.  Careful airway management.  Submandibular swelling
   significantly reduced though throat edema/anterior neck edema remains
   impressive.  Will require cont mech intubation for several days as
   swelling subsides.  Can check for cuff leak as initial marker for
   improvement.  Likely neck CT to reasess later in the week.

   Assessment and Plan
   Angioedema presumed secondary to ACE.  Very difficult nasotracheal
   intubation.  Remains intubated for airway protection.  On steroids,
   antihistamines.  Careful airway management.  Submandibular swelling
   significantly reduced though throat edema/anterior neck edema remains
   impressive.  Will require cont mech intubation for several days as
   swelling subsides.  Can check for cuff leak as initial marker for
   improvement.  Likely neck CT to reasess later in the week.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with angioedema, presumed secondary to ACE, and remains intubated for airway protection. They have undergone a difficult nasotracheal intubation and are being managed with steroids and antihistamines. The patient has a history of DVT, and prophylactic heparin is being administered. They are also at risk for stress ulcer and VAP, and prophylactic measures are being taken.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to the intubation and the risk of VAP. Close monitoring of their respiratory function is essential to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) increase their risk of developing sepsis. Vigilant monitoring of their vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
3. DVT/PE: The patient has a history of DVT, and prophylactic heparin is being administered. However, close monitoring of their lower extremities and vigilance for signs of DVT/PE are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and the use of corticosteroids increase their risk of developing stress ulcer. Proton pump inhibitors and other medications are being used to prevent this complication.
5. VAP: The patient's intubation and the risk of VAP are significant. Close monitoring of their respiratory status and the implementation of VAP prevention strategies are essential to prevent this complication.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised due to the intubation and the risk of neurological complications. Close monitoring of their neurological function is necessary to detect early signs of neurological deterioration.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) increase their risk of developing infections. Vigilant monitoring of their vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of infection.
8. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's critical illness and the use of vasoactive medications increase their risk of hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of their hemodynamic status is necessary to detect early signs of instability and prevent complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 40%. They are receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 54 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg. They are receiving fluids through multiple lines, with a total fluid input of 975 mL and output of 920 mL.

The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and their laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts. They are receiving nutrition through a fiber source and are being monitored for glycemic control. The patient's code status is unknown, and their disposition is not specified.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to their prolonged mechanical ventilation and lack of spontaneous respiratory effort.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be exacerbated by their prolonged hospitalization.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) make them at risk for developing respiratory failure, which could require further mechanical ventilation and potentially lead to endotracheal tube failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if they do not receive adequate fluid management and dialysis, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and their reliance on enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could further complicate their recovery.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged use of antibiotics and sedatives may increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridioides difficile infection or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's chronic cardiovascular disease and acute kidney injury may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema, intubated for airway protection.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - decrease IV solumedrol to 80 mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation, possibly wean to pressure support when
   patient starts demonstrating signs of spontaneous breathing, possibly
   decrease respiratory rate
   - consider ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to
   evaluate for lower airway edema
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - F/U WBC
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 and stable at 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - will add back HCTZ when BP allows
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, intubated for airway protection. She has a history of allergies, including sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, shellfish-derived, and lisinopril. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and has no history of hereditary or acquired angioedema. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is sedated and has a nasotracheal tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 8.5, Hct of 30.4, and Cr of 1.7 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mg/dL. Her glucose level is 179 mg/dL, and her Ca++ and Mg++ levels are within normal range.

The patient's plan includes:

* Decreasing IV solumedrol to 80 mg IV q8
* Continuing IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
* Continuing IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
* Continuing mechanical ventilation, possibly weaning to pressure support when the patient starts demonstrating signs of spontaneous breathing
* Considering an ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when the patient is ready for extubation to evaluate for lower airway edema
* When ready for extubation, needing anesthesia at bedside due to difficult intubation
* Holding off on antibiotics due to no evidence of infectious etiology
* Avoiding lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's angioedema may lead to airway compromise, which could worsen if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to prevent respiratory failure, especially if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced, particularly potassium, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and intubation may increase her risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and history of bleeding may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and intubation may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and HTN may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD,
   HTN presents with angioedema, intubated for airway protection.
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - cont IV solumedrol 125mg IV q8
   - cont IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - cont IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - cont mechanical ventilation, possibly wean to pressure support when
   patient starts demonstrating signs of spontaneous breathing
   - consider ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to
   evaluate for lower airway edema
   - when ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation. Likely
   pre-renal in the setting of decreased PO intake yesterday. Improved to
   baseline of 1.6 after 1 L NS.
   - cont to monitor
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor
   - F/U WBC
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   # Hyponatremia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of acute
   renal failure felt to be pre-renal in etiology. Na trending up from 127
   to 133 and stable at 133 this am. Recent baseline 137.
   - continue to follow sodium
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - will add back HCTZ when BP allows

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, intubated for airway protection. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and had a history of lisinopril, which was stopped due to an unknown allergy. She has been receiving IV solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid, and is being mechanically ventilated. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 118/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has mild facial swelling, prominent swollen tongue, and neck swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema may worsen if she is not properly managed. She may require further treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids to alleviate symptoms.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating AKI. She may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent progression to chronic kidney disease.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. She may require further testing and treatment to determine the cause of her leukocytosis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may require further treatment with antihypertensive medications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which may indicate hypovolemic hyponatremia. She may require further treatment with fluids and electrolytes to correct this imbalance.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's chest x-ray shows no signs of pneumonia, but she may be at risk for developing pneumonia due to her intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her mechanical ventilation. She may require further treatment with antibiotics and other therapies to prevent this complication.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's ultrasound is negative for DVT, but she may be at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and mechanical ventilation. She may require further treatment with anticoagulants and compression stockings to prevent this complication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with angioedema, a severe allergic reaction characterized by swelling of the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's airway is protected by an endotracheal tube, which was placed due to difficulty with nasotracheal intubation. The patient's secretions have turned yellowish in color, and they are receiving various medications, including antihistamines and steroids, to manage the angioedema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/56 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and their respiratory support is set to deliver 40% oxygen. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, indicating an inflammatory response.

Potential medical complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's airway is at risk due to the angioedema, which may lead to airway obstruction or collapse.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is set to deliver 40% oxygen, which may not be sufficient to meet their oxygen requirements, increasing the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and inflammatory markers suggest an underlying infection, which may progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's angioedema may cause cardiac compromise, leading to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli may indicate neurological compromise, which may be due to the angioedema, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's increased secretions may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
7. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if not promptly treated.
8. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's platelet count is elevated, which may indicate a risk of hemorrhage or bleeding complications.
9. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated platelet count and inflammatory markers may indicate a risk of DIC, a life-threatening condition characterized by clotting abnormalities and bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema, also
   unlikely given patient
s age. Reportedly appears improved since arrival
   to the ED. Intubated for airway protection.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Continue mechanical ventilation, RSBI 222 today.
   - Change sedation to propafol, wean as tolerated with possible SBT
   later today.
   - Check cuff leak.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation now 1.8
   with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1 suggesting intra-renal
   pathology with no casts.  Patient does not appear to have had any
   hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   - If creatinine does not improve, will check renal U/S and consult
   renal.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to follow sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF
   .
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary
   Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema, also
   unlikely given patient
s age. Reportedly appears improved since arrival
   to the ED. Intubated for airway protection.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Continue mechanical ventilation, RSBI 222 today.
   - Change sedation to propafol, wean as tolerated with possible SBT
   later today.
   - Check cuff leak.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation now 1.8
   with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1 suggesting intra-renal
   pathology with no casts.  Patient does not appear to have had any
   hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   - If creatinine does not improve, will check renal U/S and consult
   renal.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to follow sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF
   .
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary
   Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN admitted with angioedema, now intubated for airway protection. She has developed acute renal failure (ARF) and is being treated with IV solumedrol, IV benadryl, and IV pepcid. Her creatinine has improved from 1.9 to 1.8, and her blood pressure is currently normotensive. She has leukocytosis, which is likely due to steroid administration. Her hemoglobin is stable, and her sodium levels are now within normal limits. She has no evidence of DVT and is being monitored for LUE swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Tracheal tube displacement
	* Respiratory acidosis due to inadequate ventilation
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
	* Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia)
3. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac arrest
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects
	* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hyperventilation
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial or fungal infections
	* Urinary tract infections (UTIs) or other nosocomial infections
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy or other medications
	* Constipation or diarrhea due to medication side effects or electrolyte imbalances

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to identify potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with
   dementia, CAD, HTN admitted with angioedema now intubated for airway
   protection with course complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Unclear precipitating factor. Lisinopril was recently
   stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear reasons-- would wonder
   whether she started developing symptoms of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was
   recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would also consider an allergic
   reaction to food. No history of hereditary or acquired angioedema.
   Reportedly appears improved since arrival to the ED. Intubated for
   airway protection.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Continue mechanical ventilation, RSBI 222 today.
   - Will check cuff leak when patient is tolerating PS trial. Consider
   ENT c/s for scope vs CT neck when ? ready for extubation to evaluate
   for lower airway edema.  W
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   - pt should avoid lisinopril and levofloxacin in the future
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: Cr is 1.9 on presentation now 1.8
   with baseline creatinine of ~1.5. FeNa 9.1 suggesting intra-renal
   pathology with no reported casts.  Patient does not appear to have had
   any hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   - If creatinine does not improve, will check renal U/S and consult
   renal.

   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to follow sodium

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN admitted with angioedema and now intubated for airway protection due to acute renal failure (ARF). She has been receiving IV solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid, and is being mechanically ventilated. Her respiratory rate has decreased, and she is likely hyperventilating to compensate for metabolic alkalosis from renal failure. Her urine lytes suggest an ATN picture. She has a double-lumen PICC in a midline position, and her peripheral vascular examination is not assessable due to intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Respiratory failure due to ATN
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worsening
	* Fluid overload due to inadequate diuresis
3. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Hypotension due to vasodilation from beta-blocker therapy
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures due to electrolyte imbalances or medication toxicity
	* Neurological deterioration due to hypoxia or hypotension
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis due to bacterial colonization of the endotracheal tube or catheters
	* Invasive fungal infections due to prolonged antibiotic therapy
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy or stress ulcer disease
	* Malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition support
7. Other Complications:
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility
	* Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor skin care

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Facial and neck swelling continues to improve.  Patient
   had a cuff leak yesterday and RSBI this AM <100. Unclear precipitating
   factor. Lisinopril was recently stopped and listed as an allergy for
   unclear reasons-- would wonder whether she started developing symptoms
   of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would
   also consider an allergic reaction to food. No history of hereditary or
   acquired angioedema, also unlikely given patient
s age.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Wean sedation, hold TF.
   - SBT today, if tolerates would consider extubation.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Fever: Patient febrile overnight to 100.7 but hemodynamically stable.
   Pan-cultured, antibiotics not started.
   - F/u culture data
   - Would consider initiating antimicrobial therapy if patient becomes
   febrile again.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: AM labs still pending. Creatinine
   yesterday at 1.8 with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1
   suggesting intra-renal pathology with no casts.  Patient does not
   appear to have had any hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration although in setting of fever overnight concerning for
   infectious process.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u culture data
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to trend sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF\

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Facial and neck swelling continues to improve.  Patient
   had a cuff leak yesterday and RSBI this AM <100. Unclear precipitating
   factor. Lisinopril was recently stopped and listed as an allergy for
   unclear reasons-- would wonder whether she started developing symptoms
   of angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would
   also consider an allergic reaction to food. No history of hereditary or
   acquired angioedema, also unlikely given patient
s age.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Wean sedation, hold TF.
   - SBT today, if tolerates would consider extubation.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Fever: Patient febrile overnight to 100.7 but hemodynamically stable.
   Pan-cultured, antibiotics not started.
   - F/u culture data
   - Would consider initiating antimicrobial therapy if patient becomes
   febrile again.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: AM labs still pending. Creatinine
   yesterday at 1.8 with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1
   suggesting intra-renal pathology with no casts.  Patient does not
   appear to have had any hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration although in setting of fever overnight concerning for
   infectious process.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u culture data
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to trend sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF\
   .
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN who was admitted with angioedema and is currently intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition is complicated by ARF.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.7°C, blood pressure of 138/64 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, and respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 271 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL, and the patient's potassium level is 4.4 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is unchanged from admission, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
* Continuing IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
* Continuing IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
* Weaning sedation and holding TF
* SBT today, with consideration for extubation if tolerated
* Initiating antimicrobial therapy if the patient becomes febrile again
* Trending creatinine and monitoring for signs of acute kidney injury
* Continuing to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and fever curve

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Septic shock due to the patient's fever and leukocytosis
* Acute kidney injury due to the patient's ARF and hypovolemic hyponatremia
* Anaphylaxis due to the patient's history of angioedema and potential allergic reactions to medications
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and risk factors for thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5856**] is a 72 year old female with dementia, CAD, HTN admitted
   with angioedema now intubated for airway protection with course
   complicated by ARF.
   .
   # Angioedema: Facial and neck swelling continues to improve.  Patient
   has a cuff leak and RSBI this AM <100. Unclear precipitating factor.
   Lisinopril was recently stopped and listed as an allergy for unclear
   reasons-- would wonder whether she started developing symptoms of
   angioedema on [**5-11**]. Also was recently exposed to levofloxacin. Would
   also consider an allergic reaction to food. No history of hereditary or
   acquired angioedema, also unlikely given patient
s age.
   - Continue  IV solumedrol to 40mg IV q8
   - Continue IV benadryl 50mg IV q6
   - Continue IV pepcid 20mg IV q12
   - Wean sedation, hold TF.
   - SBT today, if tolerates plan for extubation.
   - When ready for extubation will need anesthesia at bedside due to
   difficult intubation
   - no evidence to suggest infectious etiology so will hold off on
   antibiotics
   .
   # Fever: Patient febrile overnight to 100.7 but hemodynamically stable.
   Pan-cultured, antibiotics not started.
   - F/u culture data
   - Would consider initiating antimicrobial therapy if patient becomes
   febrile again.
   .
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: AM labs still pending. Creatinine
   yesterday at 1.8 with baseline creatinine of 1.5-1.8. FeNa 9.1
   suggesting intra-renal pathology with no casts.  Patient does not
   appear to have had any hypotensive episodes (ATN) or contrast (CIN).
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up, afebrile, likely due to steroid
   administration although in setting of fever overnight concerning for
   infectious process.  Will cont. to monitor and reduce steroids
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - F/u culture data
   .
   # Anemia: Stable hct.
   - Trend hct
   .
   # LUE swelling: ultrasound negative for DVT.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Serum sodium now within normal limits. Hyponatremia on
   admission likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of acute renal failure and improved with volume rescucitation.
   - Continue to trend sodium
   .
   # Hypertension: Currently normotensive
   - Hold home HCTZ given resolving ARF.
   .
   # H/o seizures: continue dilantin
   .

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN, is currently intubated for airway protection due to angioedema. She was recently exposed to levofloxacin and has a history of anaphylaxis to Ace inhibitors. Her course is complicated by acute renal failure (ARF). Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.7°F, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/64 mmHg. Her lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia, which are being monitored. She is receiving IV solumedrol, benadryl, and pepcid for her angioedema and anaphylaxis, and is being weaned off sedation. A SBT is planned today, and if she tolerates it, she may be extubated. Antibiotics are being held off due to lack of evidence of an infectious etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition and lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and her FeNa suggests intra-renal pathology. AKI could worsen her ARF and lead to further complications.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and she is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and HTN put her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's dementia and anemia may increase her risk for neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's hyponatremia and anemia may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN, was admitted with angioedema and was intubated for airway protection. She was extubated successfully yesterday with stridor treated with heliox. Her facial and neck swelling has improved. She has a course complicated by ARF, and her creatinine has returned to baseline. She is currently afebrile, and her WBC count is stable. Her sodium levels are within normal limits, and her hypertension is well-controlled. She has a history of seizures and is taking dilantin. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and has a midline access line.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory: The patient's airway is still at risk due to her history of angioedema and stridor. She may require ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent respiratory compromise.
2. Renal: The patient's ARF has resolved, but she may be at risk for future kidney damage due to her underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are within normal limits, but she may be at risk for future electrolyte imbalances due to her underlying medical conditions.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and may be at risk for future seizures due to her underlying medical conditions.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, but she may be at risk for future hypertension-related complications.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia on admission may have been secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia, and she may be at risk for future hyponatremia-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN, was admitted with angioedema and was intubated for airway protection. She was extubated successfully yesterday with stridor noted several hours post-intubation, treated with heliox. The patient's fever has been afebrile overnight, and creatinine is now at baseline. Leukocytosis is slowly trending up, likely due to steroid administration. Anemia is stable, and hct is trending. Hyponatremia is resolved, and hypertension is currently normotensive. The patient's family is aware of her condition and is being kept informed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's airway swelling has improved, but she is still at risk for respiratory complications, such as stridor, due to her history of angioedema.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential for febrile response to infection make her at risk for developing an infection, particularly in the respiratory tract.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is stable, but she is at risk for further decline in renal function, particularly if she develops an infection or experiences hypovolemia.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and HTN make her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of seizures and her current medication regimen for seizure prophylaxis make her at risk for neurological complications, such as seizure activity or status epilepticus.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of anemia and her current medication regimen for anemia make her at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or malabsorption.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's history of malnutrition and her current nutritional regimen make her at risk for nutritional complications, such as malabsorption or electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 72-year-old female with dementia, CAD, and HTN, is being treated in the ICU for angioedema, acute renal failure (ARF), and other complications. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to stridor, but was successfully extubated yesterday. She is currently receiving intermittent heliox for stridor and is being treated with Lasix for fluid management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/60 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with a SpO2 of 98% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, indicating some improvement in her kidney function. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of ARF.

The patient's medical history is significant for angioedema, CAD, HTN, and anemia. She is also taking medications for her conditions, including Lasix, furosemide, and famotidine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's stridor and need for intermittent heliox suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is a significant concern, and her creatinine levels may continue to rise if her kidney function does not improve.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and hypokalemia may require close monitoring and correction to prevent further complications.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's CAD and HTN may increase her risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly if her blood pressure becomes unstable.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is stable, but she is still at risk for several medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her overall outcome."
