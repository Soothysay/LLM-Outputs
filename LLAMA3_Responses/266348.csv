   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a left shift on differential.  Was admitted on a NRB,
   but has been weened down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on admission, but is
   markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to plan than from
   peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given levo/CTX/flagyl
   in ED.
   - send off sputum cultures and urine legionella
   - will add on vanc as lives in nursing home, and continue levoflox
   - aggressive fluid [**Known lastname 6076**], and pressors if necessary to keep MAP
   > 65
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Possibly due to pna, versus UTI
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg, so has a free water deficit 4.8 L.  Would ideally
   give 120ml of d5W per hour to correct patient within 56 hrs so as to
   not cause dangerous fluid shifts with correction.  However, given need
   for rapid fluid [**Last Name (LF) 6076**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use 1/2 NS and matain close eye on
   sodium so as to not be lowered is by &#8804;0.5 meq/L per hour and no
   more than by 12 meq/L per day.  Likely etiology of altered mental
   status.
   - fluid correction with 1/2NS
   - will check urine osms
   #.  Lethargy:  Likely etilogy is from significant hypernatremia.  Also
   could be compounded from PNA.  UA shows no evidence of UTI.  With
   altered mental status and infection, would consider meningitis.  No
   nucall rigidity, and seems less likely at this time.
   - correct hypernatremia and treat PNA as given above.
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with dehyrdation.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  No great derangments on UA.  Unclear
   baseline.
   - recheck after fluid resusitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resusitation.
   #. CHF: currently hypovolemic.  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold
   metoprolol and lasix in the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont sythroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA who presents with pneumonia, sepsis physiology, and significant hypernatremia. He was admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12 and was receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has a high blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He has a history of hypercalcemia, CHF, hypothyroidism, and schizoaffective disorder.

Assessment:

The patient's sepsis is likely due to pneumonia, and he has a leukocytosis with a left shift on differential. He has a high risk of developing respiratory failure, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. His hypernatremia is likely due to poor PO intake with insensible losses, and he has a free water deficit of 4.8 L. He also has a history of hypercalcemia, which may be exacerbated by dehydration.

Plan:

The patient's plan is to receive aggressive fluid resuscitation with 1/2 NS to correct his hypernatremia and treat his pneumonia. He will also receive antibiotics, and his blood cultures will be sent off. He will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure and will receive mechanical ventilation if necessary. His hypercalcemia will be treated with fluid resuscitation, and his CHF will be managed with diuretics and vasodilators.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis physiology increase his risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal failure: The patient's pre-renal azotemia and low CVP increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's CHF and hypercalcemia increase his risk of developing cardiac arrest.
4. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and infection increase his risk of developing meningitis.
5. Sepsis-induced shock: The patient's sepsis physiology and hypotension increase his risk of developing sepsis-induced shock.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and be prepared to manage respiratory failure and sepsis-induced shock.
2. Continue to provide aggressive fluid resuscitation to correct the patient's hypernatremia and treat his pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential.  Was
   admitted on a NRB, but has been weaned down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on
   admission, but is markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to
   plan than from peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given
   levo/CTX/flagyl in ED, continued on vanc/zosyn in MICU.
   - recheck CV O2 sat
   - continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with
   goal MAP > 65
   - continue vanc/zosyn given risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg and had a free water deficit of 7 L at
   presentation.
   - correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
   - trend chemistries tid
   - check urine osmoles
   - consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion
   with family
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with volume depletion.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  Trending down with IVFs.  No great
   derangements on UA.  Unclear baseline.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 966**] records to clarify Creatinine baseline
   - recheck after fluid resuscitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Anemia:   Hct drop to 31 from 45 on admission with unknown baseline,
   likely closer to baseline now given volume depletion and hypernatremia
   at presentation.   Normal bilirubin.
   - recheck p.m. hct
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resuscitation.
   #. CHF:  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold metoprolol and lasix in
   the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont synthroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate, family prefers to avoid
   aggressive/invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing
   patient
s discomfort.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA, pneumonia with sepsis physiology, and significant hypernatremia. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and presep catheter in place. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/46 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 30 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient has a leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance, suggesting an inflammatory response. His hypernatremia is likely due to poor oral intake and insensible losses. He has a free water deficit of 7 L and is being treated with D5W at 150 cc/hr to correct his sodium levels.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL. His urine output is 165 mL over the past 24 hours, and his CVP is 10 mmHg. His anemia is likely due to blood loss or chronic disease, and his hypercalcemia is likely exacerbated by dehydration.

The patient has a history of stroke, CHF, hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, and paget's disease. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and antipsychotics. His code status is DNR, and his family prefers to avoid aggressive/invasive procedures if possible.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis physiology may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Hypernatremia-related complications: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential cardiovascular complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function may worsen if he does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation and treatment for his underlying conditions.
4. Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and potential cardiovascular complications.
5. Hypercalcemia-related complications: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to nephrocalcinosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and potential cardiovascular complications.
6. Central nervous system complications: The patient's history of stroke and potential sepsis-related cerebral edema may lead to central nervous system complications, including seizures, cerebral vasospasm, and potential brain herniation.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal losses and potential sepsis-related gastrointestinal dysfunction may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential.  Was
   admitted on a NRB, but has been weaned down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on
   admission, but is markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to
   plan than from peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given
   levo/CTX/flagyl in ED, continued on vanc/zosyn in MICU.
   - recheck CV O2 sat
   - continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with
   goal MAP > 65
   - continue vanc/zosyn given risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg and had a free water deficit of 7 L at
   presentation.
   - correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
   - trend chemistries tid
   - check urine osmoles
   - consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion
   with family
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with volume depletion.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  Trending down with IVFs.  No great
   derangements on UA.  Unclear baseline.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 966**] records to clarify Creatinine baseline
   - recheck after fluid resuscitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Anemia:   Hct drop to 31 from 45 on admission with unknown baseline,
   likely closer to baseline now given volume depletion and hypernatremia
   at presentation.   Normal bilirubin.
   - recheck p.m. hct
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resuscitation.
   #. CHF:  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold metoprolol and lasix in
   the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont synthroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate, family prefers to avoid
   aggressive/invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has pneumonia with sepsis physiology, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are significantly elevated, which can cause neurological symptoms such as headache, fatigue, and confusion. If left untreated, it can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, which can indicate pre-renal failure due to hypovolemia. If not addressed, it can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. If left untreated, it can lead to severe anemia and cardiovascular complications.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, which can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, and confusion. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe complications such as kidney damage and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and they have a history of stroke. This can increase the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure if not treated promptly. This can lead to mechanical ventilation and increased risk of mortality.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal losses, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and other complications.
9. Infections: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for further infections, including healthcare-associated pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and they have a history of stroke. This can increase the risk of further neurological complications such as seizures, brain edema, and cerebral vasospasm.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for pneumonia and sepsis
* Fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia and hypernatremia
* Vasopressors for hypotension
* Diuretics for fluid overload
* Anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis
* Pain management for comfort
* Monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and complications

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and they have a do not intubate (DNI) order. The patient's family prefers to avoid aggressive and invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing the patient's discomfort."
