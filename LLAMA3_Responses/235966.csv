   Microbiology: Blood and urine from [**9-15**] with NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory
   distress, CT head negative, toxic metabolic work-up unrevealing.  Will
   hold off on any further work up at this time.
   -Wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate and evaluate her
   mental status
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Unclear etiology, the patient has HTN at
   baseline on a multiple drug regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   .
   #. Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   .
   #. Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   .
   #. ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   .
   #. Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's 24-hour events and progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and repeated intubations increases the risk of respiratory distress. The patient's current ventilator settings and ABG results indicate an underlying respiratory acidosis, which may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Angioedema: The patient's history of angioedema and the possibility of ACE/valsartan-induced angioedema increases the risk of further episodes. The patient is currently receiving decadron to help manage this condition.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute hypoxic respiratory distress and possible hypoxia may contribute to altered mental status. Weaning sedation and evaluating the patient's mental status once ventilator settings are appropriate are crucial.
4. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's hypertension, even on a multiple-drug regimen, increases the risk of hypertensive urgency. Restarting labetalol PO and weaning the IV as tolerated may help manage this condition.
5. Mixed Acid/Base Disorder: The patient's ABG results indicate a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Correcting the underlying alkalosis before optimizing respiratory acidosis on the ventilator is essential.
6. Upper GI Bleed: The patient's history of UGIBs and coffee ground emesis increases the risk of further bleeding. Stopping IV PPI and considering famotidine in the setting of angioedema may help manage this condition.
7. ESRD: The patient's ESRD increases the risk of complications related to dialysis, such as infection and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Type II DM: The patient's Type II DM increases the risk of complications related to hyperglycemia, such as dehydration and infection.

The patient's current ICU care plan includes:

* Ventilator management to optimize respiratory acidosis
* Weaning sedation and evaluating mental status
* Restarting labetalol PO and weaning IV as tolerated for hypertensive urgency
* Managing angioedema with decadron
* Monitoring for further episodes of UGIBs
* Continuing dialysis for ESRD
* Managing Type II DM with NPH and ISS

Close monitoring and management of these potential complications are crucial to the patient's outcome."

   Microbiology: Blood and urine from [**9-15**] with NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Continue intubation for respiratory support, would come down on FiO2
   to 40%, and tolerate slightly elevated pCO2 to fix her pH
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H
   -Consider involving IP vs ENT, may need bronchoscopic assistance during
   extubation
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory
   distress, CT head negative, toxic metabolic work-up unrevealing.  Will
   hold off on any further work up at this time.
   -Wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate and evaluate her
   mental status
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Unclear etiology, the patient has HTN at
   baseline on a multiple drug regimen
   -Weaned off of labetalol gtt overnight with SBP 120-130, can
   re-introduce PO labetalol and titrate as needed once she becomes more
   hypertensive
   .
   #. Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   .
   #. Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -IV BID PPI
   .
   #. ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   .
   #. Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, altered mental status, and hypertensive urgency. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Laboratory results showed an underlying respiratory acidosis, and a CT scan of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism or other acute processes. The patient was started on decadron and has a plan to wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and underlying respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and coffee-ground emesis may lead to further bleeding if not managed properly.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertensive urgency may lead to a hypertensive crisis if not managed with careful blood pressure control.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's mixed acid-base disorder may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and chloride, if not managed with careful monitoring and replacement.
5. Infection: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and altered mental status may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and history of hypertension may increase her risk of acute kidney injury or further decline in renal function if not managed with careful fluid and electrolyte management.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure, if not managed with careful blood pressure control and cardiac monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Continue intubation for respiratory support, would come down on FiO2
   to 40%, and tolerate slightly elevated pCO2 to fix her pH
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H
   -Consider involving IP vs ENT, may need bronchoscopic assistance during
   extubation
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Likely related to acute hypoxic respiratory
   distress, CT head negative, toxic metabolic work-up unrevealing.  Will
   hold off on any further work up at this time.
   -Wean sedation once her vent settings are appropriate and evaluate her
   mental status
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Unclear etiology, the patient has HTN at
   baseline on a multiple drug regimen
   -Weaned off of labetalol gtt overnight with SBP 120-130, can
   re-introduce PO labetalol and titrate as needed once she becomes more
   hypertensive
   .
   #. Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   .
   #. Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -IV BID PPI
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/49 mmHg. Her respiratory status is being closely monitored, with a respiratory rate of 7 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 100%. She is also receiving treatment for hypertension, altered mental status, mixed acid-base disorder, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, but she may be at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her underlying respiratory disease and the need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of a central line.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to her underlying respiratory disease and the need for invasive ventilation.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk of developing it again due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is at risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening of her underlying renal disease due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrest due to her underlying cardiac disease and the need for invasive ventilation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and is at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or stroke due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of sedative medications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of a central line.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's hypertension and monitor her blood pressure closely.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her sedation levels as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's gastrointestinal bleed and monitor her stool output closely.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management as needed.
6. Consider involving a nephrologist in the patient's care to help manage her ESRD.
7. Consider involving a cardiologist in the patient's care to help manage her cardiac disease.
8. Consider involving a neurologist in the patient's care to help manage her altered mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD who presented with respiratory distress. She was found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. 

The patient has a history of repeated intubations, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. The CTA was negative for PE or any other acute process. The ABG reflects an underlying respiratory acidosis, which may be related to her upper airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 of 50%. The plan is to wean sedation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with the ET tube in place. If she is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this would be diagnostic. 

The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with labetalol. She has a mixed acid-base disorder, which is being treated with bicarbonate and chloride. She also has an upper GI bleed, which is being managed with famotidine. 

The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis three times a week. She also has type II DM and is being managed with NPH insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and mixed acid-base disorder may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleed may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient's anuric state and upper GI bleed may increase the risk of infection.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's respiratory distress and mixed acid-base disorder may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or coma.
6. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and anuric state may increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or sepsis.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's mixed acid-base disorder and type II DM may lead to metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has a history of repeated intubations and is suspected to have angioedema, possibly induced by ACE inhibitor/valsartan. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory acidosis and a high RSBI. The patient is scheduled for a tracheostomy and PEG placement today, with plans to wean sedation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with the ET tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and high RSBI suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the tracheostomy and PEG placement do not alleviate the underlying obstruction.
2. Angioedema: The patient's history of repeated intubations and suspected angioedema may lead to further airway complications, including stridor or complete airway obstruction.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension and recent increase in blood pressure may lead to a hypertensive crisis, particularly if the labetalol dose is not adjusted accordingly.
4. Mixed acid-base disorder: The patient's ABG results suggest a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis, which may lead to further complications if not addressed promptly.
5. Upper GI bleed: The patient's history of upper GI bleeds and recent coffee ground emesis may lead to further bleeding complications, particularly if the IV PPI is not discontinued.
6. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders, particularly if not managed properly.
7. Type II DM: The patient's Type II DM may lead to further complications, including hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and consider adjusting the ventilator settings and sedation as necessary.
2. Perform a tracheostomy and PEG placement as planned, and wean sedation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with the ET tube in place.
3. Adjust the labetalol dose as necessary to manage the patient's hypertension.
4. Consider adding a diuretic to manage the patient's mixed acid-base disorder.
5. Discontinue the IV PPI and consider switching to famotidine to manage the patient's suspected angioedema.
6. Continue to manage the patient's ESRD with HD and electrolyte management.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust the insulin regimen as necessary to manage the patient's Type II DM."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and was found to be unresponsive.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 of 50%. Her ABG results show a mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular: She has hypertension, which is being treated with labetalol and hydralazine.
* Renal: She is anuric and has ESRD, requiring hemodialysis three times a week.
* Gastrointestinal: She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to prevent further bleeding.
* Endocrine: She has type II diabetes mellitus and is receiving insulin sliding scale (ISS).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and mixed metabolic alkalosis may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac strain from her respiratory distress may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
* Renal complications: The patient's anuria and ESRD may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential kidney failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing PPI therapy may lead to further bleeding or gastrointestinal complications.
* Infection: The patient's anuria and immunosuppression may increase her risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Tracheostomy: To facilitate weaning of sedation and to relieve the patient's upper airway obstruction.
* Decadron: To treat the patient's suspected angioedema.
* Labetalol: To treat the patient's hypertension.
* Hemodialysis: To manage the patient's ESRD.
* Insulin sliding scale: To manage the patient's type II diabetes mellitus.
* Proton pump inhibitors: To prevent further upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Antibiotics: To prevent and treat potential infections."

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient is planned for tracheostomy and PEG placement this afternoon, and has been pre-treated with Vancomycin and Desmopressin. The patient's blood pressure has been hypertensive overnight, requiring treatment with Labetolol and Hydralazine. The patient's renal function is being monitored, and dialysis is planned prior to the procedure today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results are abnormal, with a pH of 7.26, pCO2 of 26 mmHg, and pO2 of 59 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. The patient's blood cultures and urine culture are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of respiratory failure if the patient's oxygenation and ventilation needs are not met.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if the patient's renal function is not closely monitored.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertensive crisis and tachycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated lactate levels and abnormal electrolyte levels suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ dysfunction."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and is currently intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for upper airway stricture. Her respiratory support includes a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode with a Vt set at 450 mL, RR set at 10, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is being managed with labetalol and hydralazine. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.
* Renal: The patient is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) three times a week and has a dialysis catheter in place.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is currently experiencing coffee ground emesis with guaiac-negative stools.
* Endocrine: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus and is receiving insulin sliding scale (ISS) therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure can occur due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: Hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure can occur due to the patient's underlying hypertension and ESRD.
3. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression can occur due to the patient's ongoing HD and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting can occur due to the patient's UGIB and ongoing therapy with medications that can cause gastrointestinal side effects.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her prolonged hospitalization, immunosuppression, and presence of invasive lines and catheters.

In summary, the patient is a complex case requiring close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1)Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of subglottic
   laryngeal edema of unclear etiology, DDX includes angioedema from
   ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**] vs. history of multiple intubations.  This occurred temporally
   after being restarted on valsartan, so I am very suspicious of
   angioedema.  No cuff leak on exam confirms my concerns for edema.  CTA
   negative for PE or any other acute process.  ABG reflects an underlying
   respiratory acidosis so perhaps she was tiring out from her upper
   airway obstruction prior to becoming acutely hypoxic.  Currently
   7.46/44/220 on AC 450X12 with a PEEP of 5 and an FiO2 50%.
   -Would favor a tracheostomy for this patient given her history of
   repeated intubations, will involve IP to facilitate, in the meantime,
   can wean sedation, and perform an SBT with the ET tube in place, if she
   is able to breathe with the tube relieving the stenosis, this is
   diagnostic.
   -Decadron 10mg IV q8H, evidence is not as convincing for [**Last Name (un) 239**]/ACE
   induced angioedema, but given her known edema and traumatic component,
   I would favor a three day course.
   -Hold valsartan, will discuss this plan with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   2) Hypertension The patient has HTN at baseline on a multiple drug
   regimen
   -Will restart labetalol PO and wean the gtt as tolerated
   3) Mixed acid/base disorder: ABG reflects a mixed metabolic alkalosis
   and respiratory acidosis.  I am concerned about a contraction
   alkalosis, as the patient looks dry vs. a renin-mediated process given
   her hypertension.  Bicarb and chloride responded to one liter of NS in
   ED, supporting a chloride responsive process.  Respiratory acidosis is
   likely from compensation vs. tiring out from respiratory distress.
   -Could give another small bolus, we will need to correct herunderlying
   alkalosis prior to optimizing her resp. acidosis on the vent
   -Unfortunately cannot measure urine chloride or potassium as she is
   anuric
   5)Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, with guiac negative stools.
   Has a history of UGIB's with gastritis on EGDs from [**2169**]-[**2171**]
   -can stop the IV PPI as I would prefer famotidine in the setting of
   ?angioedema
   6)ESRD
   -HD Tu/Th/Sat, will alert nephrology to her admission
   7) Type II DM
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. She had a history of multiple intubations and was restarted on valsartan, which may have triggered angioedema. The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a mixed acid-base disorder and respiratory acidosis. She has a history of upper GI bleeds and is anuric. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy, wean sedation, and perform a spontaneous breathing trial with the ET tube in place. Decadron 10mg IV q8H has been ordered to treat angioedema, and valsartan has been held. The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol PO and IV hydralazine.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may develop respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Angioedema: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and angioedema may lead to further airway compromise.
3. Upper GI bleed: The patient's history of upper GI bleeds and coffee ground emesis may lead to further bleeding and complications.
4. Mixed acid-base disorder: The patient's mixed metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis may lead to further complications if not adequately managed.
5. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
6. Type II DM: The patient's Type II DM may lead to further complications, such as hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.
7. Infection: The patient's anuric status and history of upper GI bleeds may increase her risk of infection.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and ESRD may increase her risk of DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of upper GI bleeds and ESRD may increase her risk of stress ulcer.
10. VAP: The patient's respiratory status and immobility may increase her risk of VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to unresponsiveness after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to an upper airway stricture. She is also sedated with versed/fentanyl.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a range of 144/50-148/54 mmHg. Her heart rate is 78 beats per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,204 mL of fluid, with a balance of -2,347 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 5.4 K/uL, her hemoglobin is 9.5 g/dL, and her platelet count is 213 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 22 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 4.9 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and sedatives.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's upper airway stricture may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's recent antibiotic exposure and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
* Renal dysfunction: The patient's ESRD and recent fluid overload may increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and recent coffee ground emesis may increase her risk of further bleeding.
* Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension and recent medication changes may increase her risk of developing a hypertensive crisis.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F ESRD, DM, HTN, subglottic edema due to ?
   intubations vs angioedema. Developed SOB at rehab after resuming
   valsartan. Found unresponsive at rehab with hypoxia and brought to the
   ED and intubated with difficulty given swelling. Imaging unremarkable,
   R fem CVL placed, treated with abx, and sent to MICU. Getting HD,
   awaiting T+G in OR today.
   Sedation changed from Propafol to versed, fentanyl. Reglan started for
   residuals. Had some pauses on vent and switched back to AC
   Exam notable for Tm 98.1 BP 100-40/30-70 HR 70s RR 11-15 with sat 99%
   on AC 450x10, 40% PEEP 5. 7.41/46/221
   Sedated, comfortable on vent. Chest clear, RRR S1S2S4 [**5-16**] SM at apex,
   soft abd, stasis changes, audible flow murmur over L arm. Labs notable
   for WBC 8.8K, HCT 29.7% Plt 213, K+ 5.5. NA 139, Cl 99 BUN 22 Cr 4.9
   Meds: NPH SSRI Famotidine SC Hep Chlor hex Clonidine Labetalol Fent 75
   Midaz 4 Free Water Reglan Nephrocaps
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care.
   Resp: Lighten sedation to allow for PSV.  Plan for T+G by IP in OR
   Monday. Continue to monitor for s/sx of aspiration PNA, check sputum cx
   and hold abx for now
   Hemodynamics: Will try to optimize BP control with IV / PO labetalol
   and addition of clonidine patch.
   Will monitor HCT closely given ?UGIB, continue H2B, currently stable
   without evidence of blood loss. Will hold off on long term
   anticoagulation for UEDVT per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**], HD per renal team.
   Hope tp plan for either PICC PIV or only HD line after OR to remove
   femoral line
   Monitor FSG and continue RISS.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 40 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F ESRD, DM, HTN, subglottic edema due to ?
   intubations vs angioedema. Developed SOB at rehab after resuming
   valsartan. Found unresponsive at rehab with hypoxia and brought to the
   ED and intubated with difficulty given swelling. Imaging unremarkable,
   R fem CVL placed, treated with abx, and sent to MICU. Getting HD,
   awaiting T+G in OR today.
   Sedation changed from Propafol to versed, fentanyl. Reglan started for
   residuals. Had some pauses on vent and switched back to AC
   Exam notable for Tm 98.1 BP 100-40/30-70 HR 70s RR 11-15 with sat 99%
   on AC 450x10, 40% PEEP 5. 7.41/46/221
   Sedated, comfortable on vent. Chest clear, RRR S1S2S4 [**5-16**] SM at apex,
   soft abd, stasis changes, audible flow murmur over L arm. Labs notable
   for WBC 8.8K, HCT 29.7% Plt 213, K+ 5.5. NA 139, Cl 99 BUN 22 Cr 4.9
   Meds: NPH SSRI Famotidine SC Hep Chlor hex Clonidine Labetalol Fent 75
   Midaz 4 Free Water Reglan Nephrocaps
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care.
   Resp: Lighten sedation to allow for PSV.  Plan for T+G by IP in OR
   Monday. Continue to monitor for s/sx of aspiration PNA, check sputum cx
   and hold abx for now
   Hemodynamics: Will try to optimize BP control with IV / PO labetalol
   and addition of clonidine patch.
   Will monitor HCT closely given ?UGIB, continue H2B, currently stable
   without evidence of blood loss. Will hold off on long term
   anticoagulation for UEDVT per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**], HD per renal team.
   Hope tp plan for either PICC PIV or only HD line after OR to remove
   femoral line
   Monitor FSG and continue RISS.  Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 40 minutes.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was intubated after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and is currently mechanically ventilated. Her condition has been stabilized, and she is receiving dialysis. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 144/50 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% inspired oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.8 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 29.7%
* Platelet count: 213 K/μL
* Creatinine: 4.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Sodium: 139 mmol/L
* Potassium: 5.5 mmol/L
* Chloride: 99 mmol/L

The patient's medications include:

* NPH insulin
* Famotidine (H2 blocker)
* Labetalol (antihypertensive)
* Fentanyl (pain medication)
* Midazolam (sedative)
* Reglan (anti-emetic)
* Free water
* Nephrocaps (renal medication)

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is at risk for further respiratory distress due to her underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB and is at risk for further bleeding due to her condition.
3. Hypertension: The patient has HTN and is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
4. Mixed acid-base disorder: The patient has a mixed acid-base disorder and is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance and is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation to manage the patient's respiratory distress.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to manage her condition.
3. Continue dialysis to manage the patient's ESRD.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and sepsis, and treat accordingly.
6. Consider further interventions, such as surgical intervention, to manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a tracheostomy and peg tube scheduled for Monday or Tuesday. Tube feeds were restarted per nutrition recommendations, and sedation was changed from propofol to versed/fentanyl with a good response. The patient has a residual volume of >100ml, and reglan was started. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and received vancomycin on 2173-9-17 at 12:54 PM. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions, as well as famotidine, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 144/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's blood work shows mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and elevated creatinine and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and the RSBI is 20, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a residual volume of >100ml, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and mild anemia may indicate sepsis.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to their prolonged immobility and presence of central lines.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to their presence in the ICU and use of mechanical ventilation.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to their prolonged ICU stay and use of sedatives.
7. Hemorrhage: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase their risk for hemorrhage.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider endoscopy if bleeding persists.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood work and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
4. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of DVT.
5. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to reduce the risk of stress ulcer.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory distress. She was intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding, gastritis, and ESRD, and is receiving HD. She is also diagnosed with hypertension and type II DM.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the upper airway stricture, which may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or stroke.
3. Mixed Acid/Base Disorder: The patient's mixed acid/base disorder may lead to further complications such as respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Upper GI Bleeding: The patient's history of upper GI bleeding may lead to further complications such as bleeding, anemia, or gastrointestinal perforation.
5. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or cardiovascular complications.
6. Type II DM: The patient's type II DM may lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or cardiovascular complications.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient's condition has been complicated by a femoral line-related infection, with a new leukocytosis and a positive culture from the central line and peripheral lines.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.4°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/37 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 34 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, as well as anemia and hypocalcemia. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history is significant for subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, and she has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and gastritis. The patient is currently receiving treatment for hypertension, hyperkalemia, and mixed acid-base disorder.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the femoral line-related infection.
2. Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
3. Hypertensive crisis due to the patient's underlying hypertension and the use of hydralazine.
4. Hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's electrolyte imbalance.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding and gastritis due to the patient's history of UGIB and gastritis.
6. Dialysis complications due to the patient's ESRD and the need for dialysis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, sedation with versed/fentanyl, and antibiotic therapy for the femoral line-related infection. The patient will also require surgical intervention for the subglottic laryngeal edema and stricture."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old woman with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory distress. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed a fever, leukocytosis, and a new central line infection, which is being treated with vancomycin. She also has hypertension, which is being managed with labetalol. The patient is receiving hemodialysis three times a week and has a tunneled dialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line infection: The patient's central line infection is a potential source of sepsis and septic shock. It is essential to continue antibiotics and monitor the patient's response closely.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation put her at risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring her oxygenation and ventilation parameters, as well as adjusting her ventilator settings as needed, is crucial.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, but a sudden increase in blood pressure could lead to a hypertensive crisis. Monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting her medication regimen as needed is essential.
4. Dialysis complications: The patient's tunneled dialysis catheter and hemodialysis regimen increase her risk for dialysis complications, such as bleeding, infection, or cardiovascular instability. Monitoring her dialysis parameters and adjusting her regimen as needed is crucial.
5. Worsening of subglottic laryngeal edema: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema increases her risk for worsening of this condition, which could lead to respiratory failure. Monitoring her respiratory status and adjusting her ventilator settings as needed is essential.
6. Sepsis: The patient's central line infection and leukocytosis increase her risk for sepsis. Monitoring her temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory parameters, as well as adjusting her antibiotic regimen as needed, is crucial.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of ESRD and hypertension increase her risk for cardiovascular instability. Monitoring her blood pressure, heart rate, and other cardiovascular parameters, as well as adjusting her medication regimen as needed, is essential."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is currently admitted to the ICU due to unresponsive status after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102°F (38.9°C)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 126/37 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 34 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for upper airway stricture. She is also receiving sedation with midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl.

The patient has developed a fever, leukocytosis, and new central line cultures are pending. The patient's blood cultures from 8/6 and 9/18 with NGTD are positive for oropharyngeal-like flora.

The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently receiving hydralazine and labetalol. Her blood pressure is controlled, but the patient is at risk for hypertension-related complications.

The patient has ESRD and is receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She will continue HD on Tuesday and Saturday.

The patient has type II diabetes and is receiving NPH insulin at half dose while NPO.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of VAP.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension and hydralazine treatment increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
4. Dialysis complications: The patient's ESRD and HD treatment increase the risk of dialysis complications, such as hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and bleeding.
5. Wound infections: The patient's subglottic laryngeal edema and intubation increase the risk of wound infections.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's upper airway stricture and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a medical history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient has developed a fever of 101.1°F and has been empirically treated with vancomycin for a presumed line infection. The femoral line has been discontinued, and the tip has been sent for culture. The patient has also been receiving hydralazine for hypertension and labetalol for blood pressure control.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 30%. The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled, and the patient is receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine levels, which may indicate a potential infection or inflammation. The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, which may indicate a bleeding diathesis.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Line infection: The patient's femoral line has been discontinued, and the tip has been sent for culture. If the culture results are positive, the patient may require further antibiotic therapy and may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient's chest x-ray is unchanged, the patient is at risk for VAP due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, LDH, and creatinine levels may indicate a potential infection or inflammation. The patient may be at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and elevated INR may indicate a bleeding diathesis. The patient may be at risk for bleeding complications, particularly if the patient requires invasive procedures or surgery.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, particularly if the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical comorbidities and potential complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1) Fevers/leukocystosis: Patient spiking temperatures for past 12 hours
   and also with mildly elevated WBC. Concerned about line infection given
   R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis catheter. VAP is also on the
   differential but less likely given clear cxray.
   - Vancomycin 1gm x 1
   - d/c femoral line and send tip for culture
   - f/u cultures
   2)Respiratory distress / laryngeal stricture: Patient intubated, will
   require tracheostomy early this week.
   -- Continue current ventilator settings, sedation with versed /
   fentanyl
   -- OR plan Monday /Tuesday
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following closely.
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD, has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed a fever, leukocytosis, and high tube feeding residuals, which are concerning for a potential line infection. The femoral line has been discontinued and sent for culture. Vancomycin has been empirically given to treat for a presumed line infection. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with Labetolol, and she has been receiving hemodialysis three times a week. Her blood sugars are well-controlled on her current regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a potential line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation increase her risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current use of Labetolol increase her risk of hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and stroke.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD increases her risk of complications related to kidney disease, such as electrolyte imbalances and anemia.
5. Type II DM: The patient's history of type II DM increases her risk of complications related to diabetes, such as hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and leukocyte count to assess for signs of line infection.
2. Continue to adjust the patient's ventilator settings as needed to optimize her respiratory function.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her Labetolol regimen as needed to maintain control.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her hemodialysis regimen as needed to maintain optimal kidney function.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugars and adjust her insulin regimen as needed to maintain optimal glycemic control."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1) Fevers/leukocystosis: Concerned about line infection given R femoral
   line vs. tunneled dialysis catheter. VAP is also on the differential
   but less likely given clear cxray. No evidence of cholestasis or other
   source of fever.
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD while cultures pending, would treat for 8 days
   total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   2)Respiratory distress / laryngeal stricture: Patient intubated, on
   schedule for trach / peg today.
   -- Continue current ventilator settings, sedation with versed /
   fentanyl
   -- OR today
   -- HD early in AM before surgery
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following closely.
   -- Plan for early HD before surgery
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention to functional SVC syndrome.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to unresponsiveness after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a central line, femoral line, and dialysis catheter in place. She is receiving vancomycin for suspected line infection, and cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line Infection: The patient's central line, femoral line, and dialysis catheter are at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis, bacteremia, and organ failure.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage her respiratory distress, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be well-controlled, which could lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's end-stage renal disease may progress, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may not be well-controlled, leading to complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and diabetic nephropathy.
6. Venous Thrombosis: The patient's venous thrombosis may progress, leading to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her care to prevent or minimize these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress
   1) Fevers/leukocystosis: Concerned about line infection given R femoral
   line vs. tunneled dialysis catheter. VAP is also on the differential
   but less likely given clear cxray. No evidence of cholestasis or other
   source of fever.
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD while cultures pending

   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   2)Respiratory distress / laryngeal stricture: Patient intubated, on
   schedule for trach / peg today.
   -- Continue current ventilator settings, sedation with versed /
   fentanyl
   -- OR today
   -- HD early in AM before surgery
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following closely.

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, which are concerning for line infection, particularly given the presence of a R femoral line. The patient is also at risk for respiratory distress and laryngeal stricture, and is scheduled for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. Her hypertension is well-controlled on Labetolol, and she is on hemodialysis three times a week. She has type II diabetes and is being managed with NPH insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are concerning for line infection, particularly given the presence of a R femoral line. The patient's femoral line tip culture has been negative to date, but cultures are pending.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient's chest x-ray is clear, VAP is still a possibility, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is at risk for respiratory distress due to her underlying lung disease and her intubation status.
4. Laryngeal stricture: The patient's subglottic laryngeal edema and intubation status make her at risk for laryngeal stricture.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled on Labetolol, but her blood pressure should be closely monitored to ensure that it remains under control.
6. End-stage renal disease: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis, and her renal function should be closely monitored to ensure that it remains stable.
7. Diabetes: The patient's type II diabetes requires ongoing management with insulin, and her blood sugar levels should be closely monitored to ensure that they remain under control.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and her care should be closely monitored to ensure that these complications are prevented or managed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 150/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 30% FiO2.

The patient has a history of sepsis, with a positive blood culture and a pending sputum culture. They have been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, and are on multiple medications, including fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 245 K/uL, and creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL. They have a mild elevation in liver enzymes, including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

The patient has a central venous catheter, an arterial line, and a dialysis catheter in place. They are on prophylactic heparin for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics, potentially leading to treatment failure.
3. VTE, particularly deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be life-threatening.
4. Stress ulcer bleeding, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
5. Respiratory failure, particularly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be exacerbated by mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly sinus tachycardia, which can be a sign of underlying cardiac dysfunction.
7. Renal failure, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI), which can be caused by sepsis, medications, or other factors.
8. Liver dysfunction, particularly acute liver failure (ALF), which can be caused by sepsis, medications, or other factors.
9. Coagulopathy, particularly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can be caused by sepsis or other factors.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#1 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   1) Fevers/leukocystosis: Pt has been afebrile on Vanc.  She is getting
   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   2)Respiratory distress / laryngeal stricture: now has trach, still on
   vent
   -- Wean vent & sedation with propofol
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and was found to be unresponsive. She was intubated and unable to be extubated, and a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, propofol sedation, and various medications for hypertension, type II diabetes, and ESRD.

The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, which are being treated with vancomycin. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood pressure is under control with labetalol, and she is receiving hemodialysis three times a week.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line infection: The patient has a femoral line and a tunneled dialysis catheter, which are at risk of infection. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, but the infection may not be fully cleared, and the patient may require broader coverage.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation and may require weaning and sedation with propofol. The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if the infection is not fully cleared or if the patient's underlying condition worsens.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is under control with labetalol, but the patient may require further treatment if the blood pressure increases.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is being managed with hemodialysis, but the patient may require further treatment if the disease progresses.
5. Type II diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels are well controlled, but the patient may require further treatment if the disease worsens.
6. Venous thrombosis: The patient is at risk of venous thrombosis due to her ESRD and may require further treatment if the condition develops.
7. Laryngeal stricture: The patient has a tracheostomy and may be at risk of laryngeal stricture, which could worsen her respiratory status.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to her underlying conditions and may require further treatment if an infection develops."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a tracheostomy and PEG tube in place. They are receiving propofol and mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 140/49 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7-7.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 266 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 4.9 mg/dL
* Sodium: 133 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Chloride: 20 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450-511 mL, respiratory rate of 10-15 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their sedated state, and their skin, peripheral vascular, and neurologic examinations are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and presence of a tracheostomy.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) due to the presence of central lines and arterial lines.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and the presence of central lines.
4. Pressure ulcers due to the patient's prolonged immobility and the presence of a tracheostomy and PEG tube.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's prolonged use of anticoagulants and the presence of a PEG tube.
6. Infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of central lines and PEG tube.
7. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, hypotension, or cardiac arrest due to the patient's underlying medical condition and the use of sedatives and analgesics.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure their optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#1 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   1) Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   2) Fevers/leukocystosis: Pt has been afebrile on Vanc.  She is getting
   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.
   7) Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped this
   AM.  Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation
   to fully clear.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory distress. She was intubated and required a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to difficulty weaning off the ventilator. She is currently on a ventilator with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 511 mL. Her blood pressure is 140/49 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. She has a central line infection and is being treated with vancomycin. Her mental status is minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is still elevated, and she is having difficulty weaning off the ventilator. She may require further support or invasive ventilation.
2. Line infection: The patient has a central line infection and is being treated with vancomycin. She may require further treatment or surgical intervention if the infection does not respond to antibiotics.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she may require further medication to control her hypertension.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week, and her kidney function is still compromised.
5. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels are well controlled, but she may require further medication adjustments to manage her diabetes.
6. Subglottic laryngeal edema: The patient has a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, which may predispose her to respiratory failure.
7. Mental status: The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for her cognitive impairment.
8. Venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of venous thrombosis, which may increase her risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
9. Infection: The patient has a central line infection and may be at risk for further infections due to her compromised immune system.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's line infection with vancomycin and consider further treatment or surgical intervention if the infection does not respond to antibiotics.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
4. Continue to provide hemodialysis three times a week and monitor the patient's kidney function.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's cognitive impairment.
7. Consider further treatment or prophylaxis for the patient's venous thrombosis.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic regimen as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#1 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   1) Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   2) Fevers/leukocystosis: Pt has been afebrile on Vanc.  She is getting
   tx
d for line infection given R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis
   catheter.  Vanc held yesterday b/c of supratherapeutic trough (30s).
   -- Recheck Vanc trough
   -- Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- F/U femoral line tip culture, negative to date
   -- f/u cultures
   3) Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   4)ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   5) Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   6) Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.
   7) Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped this
   AM.  Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation
   to fully clear.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a PMH of subglottic laryngeal edema, DM, HTN, and ESRD who was found unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress. She was intubated and has since undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. She is currently on a ventilator and is having difficulty weaning due to suspected deconditioning of her respiratory muscles. The patient has a history of hypertension, type II DM, and ESRD, and is currently receiving hemodialysis. She also has a line infection and is being treated with vancomycin. Her mental status is minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored for potential sedation-related complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty weaning from the ventilator increases the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she develops pneumonia or another respiratory complication.
2. Line infection: The patient's line infection is being treated with vancomycin, but there is a risk of developing resistance or experiencing side effects such as nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, but there is a risk of developing hypertensive urgency or crisis if her blood pressure becomes too high.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD increases her risk of developing complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and bone disease.
5. Type II DM: The patient's type II DM increases her risk of developing complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and nephropathy.
6. Venous thrombosis: The patient's history of venous thrombosis increases her risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Mental status: The patient's minimally responsive mental status increases her risk of developing delirium, confusion, or other cognitive impairments.
8. Sedation-related complications: The patient's history of sedation and her current minimally responsive mental status increase her risk of developing sedation-related complications such as respiratory depression, hypotension, or cardiac arrest."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient, a 75-year-old woman with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, remains intubated and ventilated. She has been tolerating minimal mechanical ventilation (MMV) and has a temperature of 101.3°F. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a tracheostomy and is being weaned off the ventilator. She has a history of fevers and is being treated for a possible line infection, with vancomycin therapy. Her stool is loose, and she is being tested for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff).

The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored for sedation clearance. Her blood pressure is well-controlled on labetalol, and she is receiving hemodialysis three times a week.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Line infection: The patient is at risk of developing a line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. C. diff: The patient's loose stool and positive C. diff test suggest a possible C. diff infection, which could lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Sedation-related complications: The patient's minimally responsive mental status and history of sedation suggest that she may be at risk of developing sedation-related complications, such as delirium or respiratory depression.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current blood pressure control suggest that she may be at risk of developing hypertension-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease or stroke.
5. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and current hemodialysis treatment suggest that she may be at risk of developing renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to identify potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory distress. She has been intubated and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 139/44 mmHg. She is receiving ventilator support and is tolerating minimal mandatory ventilation (MMV). Her mental status is minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored for sedation clearance.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a positive culture for bacteria and yeast, and is being treated with vancomycin. She also has loose stool, which may be related to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. Her blood sugar levels are well-controlled, and she is receiving hemodialysis three times a week.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and tracheostomy tube, she is at risk for developing VAP.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's loose stool and positive culture for C. diff suggest that she may have an active infection, which could worsen her condition if not properly treated.
3. Line infection: The patient's fevers and positive blood culture may indicate a line infection, which could be related to her dialysis catheter or other central lines.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing a hypertensive crisis if not properly managed.
5. Sedation clearance: The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, and it may take several days for her sedation to fully clear. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure that she is not oversedated.
6. Venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of venous thrombosis and is at risk for developing a new clot, especially given her fevers and prior catheter placement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#2 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   - Fevers: Pt w/ low grade fevers since OR.  She is currently getting
   tx
d for possible line infection given prior R femoral line vs.
   tunneled dialysis catheter.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- f/u cultures
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   -Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 75-year-old female, is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including subglottic laryngeal edema, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 139/44 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. She has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving antibiotics for a possible line infection.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and stable renal function. Her liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, weaning as tolerated, and encouragement of spontaneous breathing efforts. She is also receiving antibiotics for the possible line infection and will have blood cultures taken with hemodialysis.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and she is receiving Labetolol orally. Her ESRD requires continued hemodialysis on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Her type II diabetes is well-controlled, and she is receiving insulin aspart at half dose while NPO.

The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored. Her anemia is stable, and she will continue to be monitored and worked up as an outpatient.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not weaned from the ventilator successfully.
2. Line infection: The patient's possible line infection may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not controlled, leading to cardiovascular complications.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may lead to further kidney damage if not managed properly.
5. Diabetes: The patient's type II diabetes may worsen if not controlled, leading to complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased quality of life.
7. Mental status changes: The patient's minimally responsive mental status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of complications such as aspiration and pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 24-hour event, tolerating mechanical ventilation (MMV) with a low-grade fever (100.5°F).
* Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 139/44 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute.
* The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and famotidine (Pepcid).
* Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.7, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 66,000.
* The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is receiving antibiotic infusions.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's low-grade fever and WBC count of 11.7 suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the source of the infection and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient's respiratory support and WBC count may indicate the presence of pneumonia. A chest X-ray or CT scan may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
3. **DVT/PE:** The patient's history of penicillin allergy and prophylactic heparin sodium may indicate a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation, such as Doppler ultrasound or CT scan, may be necessary to rule out these conditions.
4. **Gastrointestinal bleeding:** The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and history of peptic ulcer disease may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. **Renal insufficiency:** The patient's creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL suggests potential renal insufficiency. Further evaluation, such as a urine output assessment and creatinine clearance, may be necessary to determine the severity of the condition.
6. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's glucose levels of 55-133 mg/dL suggest potential hyperglycemia. Further evaluation, such as a glucose tolerance test, may be necessary to determine the severity of the condition.

**Plan:**

1. Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Conduct further evaluation to identify the source of the infection, if present.
3. Consider additional antibiotic therapy if the infection is confirmed.
4. Monitor the patient's DVT/PE risk and consider further evaluation, such as Doppler ultrasound or CT scan.
5. Continue anticoagulant therapy and monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further evaluation, such as a urine output assessment and creatinine clearance.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and consider further evaluation, such as a glucose tolerance test, if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#2 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   - Fevers: Pt w/ low grade fevers since OR.  She is currently getting
   tx
d for possible line infection given prior R femoral line vs.
   tunneled dialysis catheter.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- f/u cultures
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   -Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#2 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has
   tracheostomy.  Still on vent, having difficulty weaning.  Suspect
   difficulty weaning primarily due to deconditioning of respiratory
   muscles.
   -- Wean vent as tolerated; will try on PS or MMV for a period to
   encourage her to work some on her own & strengthen her resp muscles
   - Fevers: Pt w/ low grade fevers since OR.  She is currently getting
   tx
d for possible line infection given prior R femoral line vs.
   tunneled dialysis catheter.
   -- Blood cx w/ HD
   -- Follow Vanc trough & Vancomycin 1gm qHD once trough <20
   -- Treat for 8 days total for line infection
   -- If clinically deteriorated, would broaden coverage to include gram
   negative rods
   -- f/u cultures
   - Hypertension: The patient initially presented with hypertensive
   urgency requiring Labetolol gtt. She has been off the gtt for several
   days now with excellent control of her blood pressures.
   - Continue Labetolol PO
   - ESRD:  Continue HD Tu/Th/Sat. Renal following (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 460**].
   - Type II DM: Blood sugars are well controlled on current regimen.
   -Continue NPH at half dose while NPO, with ISS
   -Anemia: stable. Con
t to monitor.  Workup as outpt
   - Venous thrombosis: Although not active at this time, would consider
   future intervention b/c of functional SVC syndrome.  Holding anticoag
   per renal team
   - Mental Status: minimally responsive even after sedation stopped.
   Con
t to monitor closely, suspect it will take days for sedation to
   fully clear.

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, remains critically ill in the ICU. She was intubated after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. A tracheostomy was performed, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation with difficulty weaning. She has been experiencing low-grade fevers since the operation and is being treated for possible line infection. Her blood pressure is well-controlled with Labetolol, and she is receiving hemodialysis three times a week. Her mental status remains minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty weaning from the ventilator and her history of subglottic laryngeal edema increase her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Line infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and history of prior R femoral line vs. tunneled dialysis catheter increase her risk of line infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current use of Labetolol increase her risk of hypertension-related complications.
4. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease increases her risk of complications related to chronic kidney disease, such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and bone disease.
5. Type II DM: The patient's history of type II diabetes mellitus increases her risk of complications related to diabetes, such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and nephropathy.
6. Venous thrombosis: The patient's history of venous thrombosis increases her risk of recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
7. Mental status changes: The patient's minimally responsive mental status increases her risk of developing further mental status changes, such as delirium or coma.
8. Infection: The patient's history of line infection and low-grade fevers increase her risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and was intubated. She was unable to be extubated and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Improved, with successful weaning from the ventilator and continued weaning of oxygen as tolerated.
* Fevers: Spiked yesterday afternoon but has remained hemodynamically stable. She is currently receiving treatment for possible line infection, including vancomycin and empiric levofloxacin and Flagyl.
* Mental status: Markedly improved, with suspicion that depressed mental status was related to lingering sedation which has now cleared.
* Hypertension: Well-controlled with labetalol and clonidine.
* ESRD: Continues to require hemodialysis three times a week, with follow-up by Dr. [First Name (STitle) 460].
* Type II DM: Blood sugars are well-controlled on current regimen, with continued use of NPH insulin.
* Anemia: Stable, with continued monitoring and workup as an outpatient.
* Venous thrombosis: Not active at this time, but consideration of future intervention due to functional superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Line infection: The patient is currently receiving treatment for possible line infection, which could lead to sepsis, bacteremia, or other complications if not effectively managed.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is receiving empiric treatment for C. difficile infection, which could lead to complications such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening colitis.
3. Tracheostomy complications: The patient's tracheostomy could lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or tracheal stenosis.
4. PEG complications: The patient's PEG could lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or obstruction.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to complications such as cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac failure, or cerebral hemorrhage if not effectively managed.
6. ESRD: The patient's ESRD could lead to complications such as uremic syndrome, electrolyte imbalances, or bone disease if not effectively managed.
7. Venous thrombosis: The patient's venous thrombosis could lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or post-thrombotic syndrome if not effectively managed.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving, but she remains at risk for various medical complications that require close monitoring and effective management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female, is a chronic illness patient with subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. She was admitted to the ICU after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on POD #3. She has been on invasive ventilation since admission and has tolerated the trach collar well. She developed a fever yesterday afternoon, which is being treated with empiric antibiotics for possible line infection. Her respiratory status has improved significantly since being weaned from the ventilator.

The patient's mental status is minimally responsive, and she is expected to take days to fully clear from sedation. Her hypertension is well-controlled, and she is on hemodialysis three times a week. Her blood sugar levels are well-controlled on her current regimen. Her anemia is stable, and she is being monitored closely. She has a history of venous thrombosis, and although not active at this time, future intervention may be considered due to functional superior vena cava syndrome.

Potential medical complications:

1. Line infection: The patient's fever and antibiotic treatment suggest the possibility of a line infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation increases her risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of respiratory infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is important.
3. Sedation-related complications: The patient's minimally responsive mental status may be related to sedation. Monitoring for signs of sedation-related complications, such as delirium or withdrawal, is essential.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of hypertension and recent hypertensive urgency increases her risk of developing a hypertensive crisis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting antihypertensive therapy as necessary is important.
5. Venous thrombosis: The patient's history of venous thrombosis and functional superior vena cava syndrome increases her risk of developing a new venous thrombosis. Monitoring for signs of venous thrombosis and adjusting anticoagulant therapy as necessary is important.
6. Anemia: The patient's stable anemia may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent complications.
7. Dialysis-related complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis, which may be complicated by issues such as access site infection or bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of dialysis-related complications is essential."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's abnormal blood pressure and heart rate
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcer due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and risk factors for bleeding
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors for thrombosis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged need for mechanical ventilation
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's abnormal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Empiric antibiotics for suspected sepsis
* Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding
* Glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia
* Nutrition support with Nutren Renal (Full) to meet the patient's nutritional needs
* Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to detect any potential complications."

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 4003**] is a 75F with a PMH s/f subglottic laryngeal edema, DM,
   HTN, and ESRD who found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic
   respiratory distress.  Pt unable to be extubated.  Now, POD#3 s/p trach
   & PEG.
   - Respiratory failure/ subglottic laryngeal edema: now has tracheostomy
   and has successfully weaned from vent. Overall respiratory status much
   improved.
   - Fevers: Pt spiked fever yesterday afternoon but has remained HD
   stable. She is currently getting tx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female with a history of subglottic laryngeal edema, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease, is currently in the ICU. She was found to be unresponsive after an episode of hypoxic respiratory distress and was unable to be extubated. She has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and has successfully weaned from ventilation. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, with a fever of 103.5°F, and is receiving empiric antibiotics for possible line infection. Her mental status remains minimally responsive, and she is being closely monitored. Her blood pressure is well-controlled, and she is receiving hemodialysis three times a week. Her anemia is stable, and she is being monitored for potential venous thrombosis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Line infection: The patient is at risk for developing a line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate, requiring reintubation or mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and empiric antibiotics suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
4. Venous thrombosis: The patient's history of subglottic laryngeal edema and end-stage renal disease increases her risk for venous thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status could continue to deteriorate, leading to confusion, agitation, or even coma.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's loose stool could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure."
