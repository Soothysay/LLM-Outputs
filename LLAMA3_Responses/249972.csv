   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable s/p
   chemoembolization with acute abdomen and free air now s/p ex lap sent
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer monitoring.
   .
   Plan:
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause? Possible causes include mesenteric ischemia from celiac axsis
   during chemo-embol, excessive narcotic, spontaneous, although clear
   cause is still uncertain. Pt went for ex-lap and had a dilated cecum to
   14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   - change pain meds to morphine
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics, 1 week ago his INR and
   albumin were normal, more recently post embolization his INR was 1.5
   and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and albumin 2.6
   - check ammonia level
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   .
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt was on
   PSV, tolerating and extubated..
   - Will cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.7.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   -follow urine output and avoid further insult and IVF
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications
   .
   # ?Pneumonia: the patient had been on levaquin for the past few days
   for a question of pneumonia.  L hilar opacity.
   -has rec'd a 5 day course of levoflox and rec'd 1 dose of vanc /
   meropenem today so has likely finished an adequate course of treatment
   for community acquired pneumonia
   - f/u CXR today
   .
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Known portal vein thrombosis, the patient had
   not been on anticoagulation until this past weekend (Sunday [**10-30**])-
   treatment doses of lovenox.  Will hold lovenox for now and d/w surgery
   when it is okay from a surgical standpoint to restart the lovenox
   safely.
   -          will order abdominal u/s to assess chronic vs. acute portal
   vein thrombosis
   -          - will f/u with surgery and onc
   .
   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: s/p chemoembolization on [**10-27**].
   -f/u Onc recs
   -has not rec'd any chemo, tumor was unresectable, may also have primary
   renal cell +/- primary prostate CA but these have not been biopsied /
   diagnosed as of yet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular cancer, unresectable, who underwent chemoembolization and developed an acute abdomen with free air. He was sent to the ICU for closer monitoring and has been diagnosed with pneumotosis intestinalis. The patient has undergone exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) and had a dilated cecum to 14cm, with a cecostomy tube placed.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, with a PaO2 of 265, and is at risk for further respiratory compromise due to pneumotosis intestinalis.
2. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3, and it has increased to 1.7, likely due to ATN caused by contrast given during chemoembolization.
3. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping, but increases when the patient is aroused and awakened.
4. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has known portal vein thrombosis, and treatment doses of lovenox were started on Sunday, but will be held for now.
5. Hepatocellular carcinoma: The patient has a history of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and has undergone chemoembolization.
6. Possible pneumonia: The patient has a question of pneumonia, with L hilar opacity, and has received a 5-day course of levofloxacin and one dose of vancomycin and meropenem.
7. Abdominal distension: The patient has diffuse tenderness and is obese, with a cecostomy tube draining stools.
8. Mental status changes: The patient was noted to be lethargic, but is able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.

The patient's medications include:

* Ciprofloxacin
* Flagyl
* Morphine
* Lovenox (held for now)
* H2 blocker (Famotidine)
* Prophylactic antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue ciprofloxacin and flagyl
* Aim for a slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 to benefit pneumotosis intestinalis
* Monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
* Bolus for urine output < 50cc, and weight is 100kg
* Follow up blood cultures and check ammonia level
* Hold sedation and reassess mental status
* Trend LFTs and INR/albumin
* Continue to monitor respiratory status
* Renally dose medications
* Follow urine output and avoid further insult and IVF
* Hold lovenox for now and discuss with surgery when it is okay to restart safely
* Order abdominal ultrasound to assess chronic vs. acute portal vein thrombosis
* Follow up with surgery and oncology recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable s/p
   chemoembolization with acute abdomen and free air now s/p ex lap sent
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer monitoring.
   .
   Plan:
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause, ? [**3-5**] chemo-embolization procedure? Pt went for ex-lap and had a
   dilated cecum to 14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics, 1 week ago his INR and
   albumin were normal, more recently post embolization his INR was 1.5
   and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and albumin 2.6
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   .
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt
   currently on PSV and tolerating.
   - will attempt to wean and extubate this AM if tolerating PSV, holding
   sedation
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.7.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   -follow urine output and avoid further insult and IVF
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications
   .
   # ?Pneumonia: the patient had been on levaquin for the past few days
   for a question of pneumonia.  L hilar opacity.
   -has rec'd a 5 day course of levoflox and rec'd 1 dose of vanc /
   meropenem today so has likely finished an adequate course of treatment
   for community acquired pneumonia
   - f/u CXR today
   .
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Known portal vein thrombosis, the patient had
   not been on anticoagulation until this past weekend (Sunday [**10-30**])-
   treatment doses of lovenox.  Will hold lovenox for now and d/w surgery
   when it is okay from a surgical standpoint to restart the lovenox
   safely.

   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: s/p chemoembolization on [**10-27**].
   -f/u Onc recs
   -has not rec'd any chemo, tumor was unresectable, may also have primary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assesment: 70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable s/p
   chemoembolization with acute abdomen and free air now s/p ex lap sent
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer monitoring.
   .
   Plan:
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause, ? [**3-5**] chemo-embolization procedure? Pt went for ex-lap and had a
   dilated cecum to 14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics, 1 week ago his INR and
   albumin were normal, more recently post embolization his INR was 1.5
   and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and albumin 2.6
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   .
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt
   currently on PSV and tolerating.
   - will attempt to wean and extubate this AM if tolerating PSV, holding
   sedation
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.7.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   -follow urine output and avoid further insult and IVF
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications
   .
   # ?Pneumonia: the patient had been on levaquin for the past few days
   for a question of pneumonia.  L hilar opacity.
   -has rec'd a 5 day course of levoflox and rec'd 1 dose of vanc /
   meropenem today so has likely finished an adequate course of treatment
   for community acquired pneumonia
   - f/u CXR today
   .
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Known portal vein thrombosis, the patient had
   not been on anticoagulation until this past weekend (Sunday [**10-30**])-
   treatment doses of lovenox.  Will hold lovenox for now and d/w surgery
   when it is okay from a surgical standpoint to restart the lovenox
   safely.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with unresectable hepatocellular cancer, who underwent chemoembolization and developed acute abdomen with pneumotosis intestinalis. He was taken to the operating room for exploration and a cecostomy tube was placed. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, but he has episodes of hypotension when sleeping. His mental status is lethargic, but he is able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions. The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis and is on anticoagulation therapy. He has also been diagnosed with acute kidney injury and is receiving renal-dose medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he is at risk for respiratory complications due to his underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has pneumotosis intestinalis, which can lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further deterioration of his renal function.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he is at risk for hypotension or hypertension.
5. Infections: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a history of portal vein thrombosis and is on anticoagulation therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding complications.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's mental status is lethargic, and he is at risk for further neurological deterioration due to his underlying condition and the need for sedation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and monitor for signs of bowel obstruction or perforation.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his medications accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust his antibiotics as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of bleeding complications and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: RUQ US: 1. Patent main portal and right portal vein. There is
   flow within the left portal vein but is not wall-to-wall suggesting
   non-occlusive thrombus. Since the horizontal branch of the portal vein
   is not seen the nonocclusive thrombus might be more affecting the
   horizontal branch. There is flow within the vertical branch.
   2. Heterogeneous but predominantly solid mass with vascular flow seen
   within
   the upper pole of the left kidney.
   3. Trace fluid seen around the gallbladder but no evidence for
   cholecystitis.
   4. Heterogenous mass in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with
   HCC status post chemoembolization.
   Assessment and Plan
   70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable, s/p chemoembolization
   complicated by acute abdomen w/ pneumatosis intestinalis, now s/p ex
   lap sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer monitoring.  Extubated [**2140-11-3**].
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause? Possible causes include mesenteric ischemia from celiac axis
   during chemo-embol, excessive narcotic, spontaneous, although clear
   cause is still uncertain. Pt went for ex-lap and had a dilated cecum to
   14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   - change pain meds to morphine
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED.  Still somewhat confused.  DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics,
   1 week ago his INR and albumin were normal, more recently post
   embolization his INR was 1.5 and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and
   albumin 2.6
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt was on
   PSV, tolerating and extubated..
   - Will cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.3.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications
   .
   # ?Pneumonia: the patient had been on levaquin for the past few days
   for a question of pneumonia.  L hilar opacity.
   -has rec'd a 5 day course of levoflox and rec'd 1 dose of vanc /
   meropenem today so has likely finished an adequate course of treatment
   for community acquired pneumonia
   - f/u CXR today
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Known portal vein thrombosis, the patient had
   not been on anticoagulation until this past weekend (Sunday [**10-30**])-
   treatment doses of lovenox.  Will hold lovenox for now and d/w surgery
   when it is okay from a surgical standpoint to restart the lovenox
   safely.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent chemoembolization. He has been admitted to the ICU due to acute abdomen with pneumotosis intestinalis, which was treated with exploratory laparotomy and placement of a cecostomy tube.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory rate (RR) is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 96%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure (BP) is 140/68 mmHg, and his heart rate (HR) is 90 beats per minute. He has a history of hypotension, which is currently being managed with boluses of fluid.
* Neurological: The patient is lethargic and confused, but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions. His mental status is being closely monitored, and he is being held for further evaluation.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL. His urine output is being closely monitored, and he is being treated with renally adjusted doses of medications.
* Hepatic: The patient has portal vein thrombosis, which is being treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (lovenox). He also has a history of HCC, which is being monitored and treated with oncological recommendations.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a cecostomy tube and is being managed with nasogastric tube (NGT) to low continuous suction. His stool output is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient had a question of pneumonia, which was treated with a 5-day course of levofloxacin. He is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of AKI and is at risk for developing sepsis due to his underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospitalization.
* Hepatic failure: The patient has portal vein thrombosis and a history of HCC, which may lead to hepatic failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospitalization.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypotension and is at risk for developing cardiovascular complications due to his underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospitalization.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide sedation as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal status and adjust his medications accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and provide nutritional support as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hepatic status and provide oncological recommendations as needed.
* Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his plan of care accordingly to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of unresectable hepatocellular cancer, complicated by acute abdomen with pneumatosis intestinalis, and now s/p ex-lap with placement of cecostomy. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on lovenox for portal vein thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/68 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 96% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated liver enzymes and troponin-T. The patient's creatinine has decreased from 2.1 to 1.3 mg/dL, suggesting resolution of acute kidney injury.

The patient's imaging studies show a patent main portal and right portal vein, with a non-occlusive thrombus in the left portal vein. There is also a heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.

The patient's medical history is significant for acute abdomen, pneumotosis intestinalis, and chemoembolization. The patient's current medications include lovenox, fentanyl, morphine, and famotidine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's non-occlusive thrombus in the left portal vein may lead to further complications, such as liver failure or sepsis.
2. Hepatocellular carcinoma: The patient's unresectable tumor may continue to grow and spread, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's recent episode of acute kidney injury may recur, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
4. Sepsis: The patient's recent episode of pneumotosis intestinalis and chemoembolization may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent episode of pneumotosis intestinalis and chemoembolization may lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure, if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the patient's potential medical complications are significant and potentially life-threatening. It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: RUQ US: 1. Patent main portal and right portal vein. There is
   flow within the left portal vein but is not wall-to-wall suggesting
   non-occlusive thrombus. Since the horizontal branch of the portal vein
   is not seen the nonocclusive thrombus might be more affecting the
   horizontal branch. There is flow within the vertical branch.
   2. Heterogeneous but predominantly solid mass with vascular flow seen
   within
   the upper pole of the left kidney.
   3. Trace fluid seen around the gallbladder but no evidence for
   cholecystitis.
   4. Heterogenous mass in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with
   HCC status post chemoembolization.
   Assessment and Plan
   70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable s/p chemoembolization with
   acute abdomen and free air now s/p ex lap sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer
   monitoring.
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause? Possible causes include mesenteric ischemia from celiac axsis
   during chemo-embol, excessive narcotic, spontaneous, although clear
   cause is still uncertain. Pt went for ex-lap and had a dilated cecum to
   14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   - change pain meds to morphine
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED.  Still somewhat confused.  DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics,
   1 week ago his INR and albumin were normal, more recently post
   embolization his INR was 1.5 and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and
   albumin 2.6
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt was on
   PSV, tolerating and extubated..
   - Will cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.3.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications
   .
   # ?Pneumonia: the patient had been on levaquin for the past few days
   for a question of pneumonia.  L hilar opacity.
   -has rec'd a 5 day course of levoflox and rec'd 1 dose of vanc /
   meropenem today so has likely finished an adequate course of treatment
   for community acquired pneumonia
   - f/u CXR today
   # Portal Vein Thrombosis: Known portal vein thrombosis, the patient had
   not been on anticoagulation until this past weekend (Sunday [**10-30**])-
   treatment doses of lovenox.  Will hold lovenox for now and d/w surgery
   when it is okay from a surgical standpoint to restart the lovenox
   safely.
   -   will order abdominal u/s to assess chronic vs. acute portal vein
   thrombosis
   - will f/u with surgery and onc
   # Hepatocellular carcinoma: s/p chemoembolization on [**10-27**].
   -f/u Onc recs
   -has not rec'd any chemo, tumor was unresectable, may also have primary
   renal cell +/- primary prostate CA but these have not been biopsied /
   diagnosed as of yet
   # FEN:  NPO for now, advance diet slowly- will f/u surgery recs re:

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of unresectable hepatocellular cancer, who underwent chemoembolization and developed an acute abdomen with free air, which led to an exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) and placement of a cecostomy tube. The patient was also found to have a non-occlusive thrombus in the left portal vein.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a FiO2 of 40% and SpO2 of 96%. The ABG results show a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 24 mmHg, which is being treated with a slightly higher PaO2 target of around 200 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has episodes of hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60's when sleeping, but increases when the patient is aroused and awakened.
* Neurological: The patient is lethargic, but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) likely caused by contrast given during chemoembolization, and is being treated with renally-dosed medications.
* Hepatic: The patient has a known portal vein thrombosis and is being treated with lovenox, but the medication will be held for now and restarted safely when cleared by surgery.
* Infections: The patient has a question of pneumonia, which has been treated with a 5-day course of levoflox and one dose of vancomycin and meropenem.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a cecostomy tube in place and is NPO for now, with plans to advance diet slowly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: Despite treatment, the patient's pneumonia may not be fully resolved, and there is a risk of progression or development of a secondary infection.
* ATN: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or need for dialysis.
* Portal vein thrombosis: The patient's known portal vein thrombosis may worsen or become occlusive, leading to liver dysfunction or failure.
* Hepatocellular carcinoma: The patient's unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma may progress, leading to further complications such as liver failure, portal hypertension, or development of metastases.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cecostomy tube may cause bleeding or obstruction, leading to further complications.
* Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and tubes may increase the risk of sepsis.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting treatment plans accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
