   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - start stress dose IV steroids as pt unable to continue taking POs
   - will discuss with GI about restarting home 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The patient has a portacath in place, and her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/51 mmHg. Her respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is notable for a soft, diffusely tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present, and a left-sided ostomy with dark guaiac-positive output.

The patient has a rising white blood cell count, lactate, and bilirubin, which is concerning for stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge after recent ERCP. Other potential etiologies of her abdominal pain include ischemic bowel, obstruction, perforation, abscess, and biliary or peritoneal fistula. The patient has received vancomycin and Unasyn, and her plan includes ERCP in the morning, surgical team co-management, and broadening antibiotics if her clinical presentation worsens.

The patient has a coagulopathy with an INR of 2.0, which is unclear in etiology. She has received IV vitamin K and FFP, and her DIC labs are not concerning. The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may be due to her known Crohn's disease, but also raises concerns for ischemic colitis, ulcers, or other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge after ERCP, leading to worsening abdominal pain and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Ischemic bowel, which could lead to bowel necrosis and perforation.
3. Obstruction, which could lead to bowel perforation and peritonitis.
4. Perforation, which could lead to peritonitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Abscess, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Biliary or peritoneal fistula, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for further interventions, such as ERCP, surgical management, and transfusions as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Initially her
   bilirubin was not elevated but now it is 2.3.  Pain developed shortly
   after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan pending.  WBC count and bilirubin
   rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - CT scan stat with IV contrast
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr
   - likely ERCP in the AM
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   - will get baseline CXR tonight
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs
   - monitor INR
   - FFP if necessary prior to ERCP in the AM
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen

   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The patient has a portacath inserted on [**2135-10-6**] and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/51 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% and a respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 326 K/μL. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 218 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 153 U/L. Her bilirubin level is elevated at 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal examination is notable for diffuse tenderness, and her stool is guaiac positive. She has a left-sided ostomy in place, and her urine output is normal.

The patient's diagnosis is complicated, with multiple potential etiologies for her abdominal pain, including stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge, ischemic bowel, obstruction, perforation, abscess, and biliary or peritoneal fistula. Her coagulopathy is also unclear, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 on presentation.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Trending liver function tests, white blood cell count, and bilirubin level.
2. Performing a computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast to evaluate for potential causes of abdominal pain.
3. Broadening antibiotic coverage if the patient's clinical presentation worsens.
4. Managing the patient's pain and nausea with medications.
5. Maintaining the patient's hydration with normal saline.
6. Monitoring the patient's electrolytes and coagulation profile.
7. Co-managing the patient with the surgical team.
8. Considering an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure in the morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 2.0 on presentation and the presence of guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of coagulopathy.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stools and elevated bilirubin level suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Ischemic bowel: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of ischemic bowel.
5. Perforation: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of perforation.
6. Abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of abscess.
7. Biliary or peritoneal fistula: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of biliary or peritoneal fistula.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated bilirubin level and guaiac positive stools suggest the possibility of pancreatitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RUQ PAIN
 concern for hepatobiliary disease, most concern for
   cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak (recent percutaneous drain),
   obstructed biliary stents.  Also consider intraabdominal abcess
   (multiple prior surgeries) or bowel ischemia.  No evidence for
   peritonitis or concern for bowel perforation.  Presence of coagulopathy
   and guiac + stool concerning for bowel ishcemia, and lipase elevated
   although HCO3 WNL.  Possible acute pancreatitis.  ABD CT does not
   demonstrate acute pathology (but limited study).  Plan monitor serial
   abd exam, iv fluids, empirical antimicrobials, ERCP team to evaluate
   --> ERCP today.  General Surgery to continue to follow.
   TACHYCARDIA -- persistent, suspect multifactorial including pain,
   anxiety and hypovolemia.  Monitor.  Replete iv fluid boluses.
   ELEVATED WBC -- increasing.  Concern for localized infection, likely
   biliary source.  Monitor.
   SEPSIS --  SIRS with likely intraabdominal infectious source.  Continue
   volume resussitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from central line placement for
   monitoring CVP and SvO2.  Await culture results.
   COAGULOPATHY
 corrected INR with vit K, FFP.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia. Replete with iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LFT ABNORMALITY
  concern for biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFTs, amylase, lipase.  ABD CT scan.
   HTN
 likely due to pain.  Now better controlled with optimized pain
   mangement.  Monitor BP.
   CROHNS -- initiate steroids, consult GI service to assist in
   management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 short gut syndrome.  TPN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RUQ PAIN
 concern for hepatobiliary disease, most concern for
   cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak (recent percutaneous drain),
   obstructed biliary stents.  Also consider intraabdominal abcess
   (multiple prior surgeries) or bowel ischemia.  No evidence for
   peritonitis or concern for bowel perforation.  Presence of coagulopathy
   and guiac + stool concerning for bowel ishcemia, and lipase elevated
   although HCO3 WNL.  Possible acute pancreatitis.  ABD CT does not
   demonstrate acute pathology (but limited study).  Plan monitor serial
   abd exam, iv fluids, empirical antimicrobials, ERCP team to evaluate
   --> ERCP today.  General Surgery to continue to follow.
   TACHYCARDIA -- persistent, suspect multifactorial including pain,
   anxiety and hypovolemia.  Monitor.  Replete iv fluid boluses.
   ELEVATED WBC -- increasing.  Concern for localized infection, likely
   biliary source.  Monitor.
   SEPSIS --  SIRS with likely intraabdominal infectious source.  Continue
   volume resussitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from central line placement for
   monitoring CVP and SvO2.  Await culture results.
   COAGULOPATHY
 corrected INR with vit K, FFP.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia. Replete with iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LFT ABNORMALITY
  concern for biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFTs, amylase, lipase.  ABD CT scan.
   HTN
 likely due to pain.  Now better controlled with optimized pain
   mangement.  Monitor BP.
   CROHNS -- initiate steroids, consult GI service to assist in

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, RUQ pain, and multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by an intraabdominal infectious source, possibly related to the recent percutaneous drain, obstructed biliary stents, or bowel ischemia. The patient's coagulopathy and elevated lipase levels are concerning for bowel ischemia and acute pancreatitis.
2. RUQ Pain: The patient's RUQ pain is likely related to hepatobiliary disease, possibly cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak. The patient's abdominal CT scan did not demonstrate acute pathology, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible biliary obstruction.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to sepsis and may be corrected with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia is likely related to sepsis and may be corrected with intravenous fluids.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including pain, anxiety, and hypovolemia.
6. Elevated WBC: The patient's increasing WBC count is concerning for localized infection, possibly related to the biliary source.
7. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is preserved, but the patient's urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels should be closely monitored.
8. LFT Abnormality: The patient's LFT abnormality is concerning for biliary obstruction and should be monitored with serial LFTs, amylase, and lipase levels.
9. HTN: The patient's HTN is likely related to pain and should be closely monitored and managed with optimized pain management.
10. Crohn's Disease: The patient's Crohn's disease should be managed with steroids and consultation with the GI service.
11. Nutritional Support: The patient's short gut syndrome requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
12. ICU Care: The patient requires close monitoring in the ICU, including glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.

In summary, the patient's complex condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple potential medical complications, including sepsis, RUQ pain, coagulopathy, hypovolemia, tachycardia, elevated WBC, renal function, LFT abnormality, HTN, Crohn's disease, and nutritional support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RUQ PAIN
 concern for hepatobiliary disease, most concern for
   cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak (recent percutaneous drain),
   obstructed biliary stents.  Also consider intraabdominal abcess
   (multiple prior surgeries) or bowel ischemia.  No evidence for
   peritonitis or concern for bowel perforation.  Presence of coagulopathy
   and guiac + stool concerning for bowel ishcemia, and lipase elevated
   although HCO3 WNL.  Possible acute pancreatitis.  ABD CT does not
   demonstrate acute pathology (but limited study).  Plan monitor serial
   abd exam, iv fluids, empirical antimicrobials, ERCP team to evaluate
   --> ERCP today.  General Surgery to continue to follow.
   TACHYCARDIA -- persistent, suspect multifactorial including pain,
   anxiety and hypovolemia.  Monitor.  Replete iv fluid boluses.
   ELEVATED WBC -- increasing.  Concern for localized infection, likely
   biliary source.  Monitor.
   SEPSIS --  SIRS with likely intraabdominal infectious source.  Continue
   volume resussitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from central line placement for
   monitoring CVP and SvO2.  Await culture results.
   COAGULOPATHY
 corrected INR with vit K, FFP.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia. Replete with iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LFT ABNORMALITY
  concern for biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFTs, amylase, lipase.  ABD CT scan.
   HTN
 likely due to pain.  Now better controlled with optimized pain
   mangement.  Monitor BP.
   CROHNS -- initiate steroids, consult GI service to assist in
   management.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have been experiencing abdominal pain, which has improved with morphine and dilaudid. The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and has a percutaneous drain in place. The assessment suggests concern for hepatobiliary disease, specifically cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak, as well as intraabdominal abscess or bowel ischemia. The patient has coagulopathy and guiac-positive stool, which may indicate bowel ischemia. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, likely due to pain, anxiety, and hypovolemia. The plan is to monitor serial abdominal exams, IV fluids, and empirical antimicrobials, and to consult with the ERCP team and General Surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure, septic shock, and death.
2. Intraabdominal Abscess: The patient's history of multiple surgeries and presence of a percutaneous drain increases the risk of developing an intraabdominal abscess, which can lead to further complications such as perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
3. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's guiac-positive stool and elevated lipase levels suggest the possibility of bowel ischemia, which can lead to necrosis, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Cholodocholithiasis or Biliary Leak: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak, which can lead to further complications such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, and sepsis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as hemorrhage, hypovolemia, and shock.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.
7. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated lipase levels and abdominal pain suggest the possibility of acute pancreatitis, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
8. Short Gut Syndrome: The patient's history of multiple surgeries and presence of a percutaneous drain increases the risk of developing short gut syndrome, which can lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
9. Infections: The patient's presence of a percutaneous drain and history of multiple surgeries increases the risk of developing infections, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death."

   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Respiratory Failure
 Patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday.  Plan
   to extubate once pain control and agitation are better controlled.
   Patient is hypertensive this morning likely due to agitation
   - extubate today once pain under control and patient is less
   hypertensive
   - hydralazine IV x 1 to control hypertension
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  T bili elevated this AM, 4.8
 8.9.  ERCP
   was notified, they are of the opinion that she likely clotted again,
   but they want to wait until after she
s stopped bleeding before they
   repeat ERCP.
   - fractionate bili
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - f/u culture data
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 100 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP, INR 1.3 today.  DIC labs are not concerning.
   - monitor INR daily
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - consult GI regarding steroid dosing and restarting 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, cholecystitis, and short gut syndrome, who presented to the ICU with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. She underwent ERCP with stent placement on 9/30 and was intubated for ERCP yesterday. She has been experiencing bleeding from the ampulla, and fresh blood was seen oozing from the ampulla during ERCP. She was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has a hematocrit of 32.1.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is 32.1, indicating anemia.
2. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute pain and chronic pain, and is receiving morphine and other pain medications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.0, and is at risk for bleeding and clotting complications.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, and is at risk for further bleeding and complications.
5. Crohn's disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, and is at risk for further complications and flares.
6. Short gut syndrome: The patient has short gut syndrome, which can lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for further bleeding from the ampulla, and may require additional transfusions and medical management.
2. Coagulopathy complications: The patient's elevated INR may lead to bleeding and clotting complications, and may require further medical management.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further complications, such as perforation or abscesses.
4. Crohn's disease complications: The patient's Crohn's disease may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Short gut syndrome complications: The patient's short gut syndrome may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and coagulation status, and provide further transfusions and medical management as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort with morphine and other pain medications.
3. Consult with gastroenterology and surgery to determine the best course of management for the patient's Crohn's disease and short gut syndrome.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide repletion as needed.
5. Consider repeating ERCP to evaluate the ampulla and determine the source of the bleeding."

   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. After ERCP, she was found to have large blood clots extracted, fresh blood seen oozing from the ampulla, and was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells. She has been experiencing diffuse abdominal pain, leukocytosis with a left shift, and rising liver function tests. She is currently being managed with antibiotics, pain control, and is awaiting further evaluation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge: The patient's abdominal pain developed shortly after ERCP, which may indicate stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge.
2. Ischemic bowel: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools may indicate ischemic bowel.
3. Obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain and distended gallbladder may indicate obstruction.
4. Perforation: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools may indicate perforation.
5. Abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and rising liver function tests may indicate abscess.
6. Biliary/peritoneal fistula: The patient's abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools may indicate biliary/peritoneal fistula.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 2.0 on presentation may indicate coagulopathy, which may be due to nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stools may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be due to Crohn's disease, ischemic colitis, or other etiologies.
9. Infection: The patient's rising liver function tests and leukocytosis with a left shift may indicate infection.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's short gut syndrome may indicate malnutrition, which may worsen her condition.

The patient requires close monitoring and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-kg individual admitted to the ICU with sepsis, post-ERCP, and a history of Crohn's disease, cholecystitis, and calculous. The patient remains intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has ongoing bleeding from the biliary tree, with clots extracted during the ERCP procedure. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells and is being treated with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam.

The patient has a range of comorbidities, including anemia, pain, and coagulopathy. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of biliary obstruction, with increasing levels of total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with tachypnea and hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary tree is still bleeding, and there is a risk of further obstruction or perforation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, and there is a risk of further decline in their condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is ongoing, and there is a risk of further bleeding or clotting complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is ongoing, and there is a risk of further decline in their hemoglobin levels.
6. Pain: The patient is experiencing ongoing pain, and there is a risk of further exacerbation.
7. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient's biliary tree is still bleeding, and there is a risk of intra-abdominal infection.
8. Bowel ischemia: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of bowel ischemia, and there is a risk of further complications.
9. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of elevated lipase levels, and there is a risk of acute pancreatitis.
10. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is preserved, but there is a risk of further decline in their condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's biliary tree and potential complications.
4. Continue to optimize the patient's pain management with morphine and other analgesics.
5. Consider further consultation with the gastroenterology and general surgery services to evaluate the patient's ongoing bleeding and potential complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide maintenance IV fluids.
7. Consider further consultation with the nephrology service to evaluate the patient's renal function and potential complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and provide further treatment as needed.
9. Consider further consultation with the infectious disease service to evaluate the patient's ongoing sepsis and potential complications.
10. Continue to provide ongoing care and management to the patient in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and a history of cholelithiasis, who presented with sepsis and biliary obstruction. She underwent ERCP, which revealed bleeding from the biliary tree, and was found to have large clots in the biliary tree. The patient remains intubated and is being managed with empiric antibiotics, pain control, and coagulopathy correction. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and her bilirubin level is increasing, which is concerning for recurrent obstruction. The patient is at risk for bleeding from the biliary tree and has a history of recurrent biliary obstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent biliary obstruction: The patient's bilirubin level is increasing, which may indicate recurrent obstruction, potentially leading to further complications such as jaundice, pruritus, and cholestasis.
2. Bleeding from the biliary tree: The patient has a history of bleeding from the biliary tree, which may recur, potentially leading to hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a history of respiratory failure, which may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Tachycardia and hypertension: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be due to agitation, pain, or anxiety, and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which may worsen if not managed properly, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis, which may recur if not managed properly, potentially leading to further complications such as organ failure or death.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving IV fluids and is NPO, which may lead to malnutrition if not managed properly.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, which may not be effective in preventing stress ulcers, potentially leading to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to intubation, which may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, or death.
10. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility, which may lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism or death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-8**]
   -Extubated today - pt refused post extubation ABG. Mentating well, SaO2
   95% NC, denies SOB.
   .
   - WBC elevated yesterday afternoon to 27-29. Entire CBC was elevated.
   At 1AM labs, counts were more consistent with yesterday AM. Etiology
   still unclear.
   .
   CBC increased -> most likely pre-renal as all counts up; leukocytosis
   may be due to steroids, C. diff; given IVF at 150cc/hr and urine lytes
   sent (forgot to get Cr!), C. diff sent.
   -Surgery: no recs
   -ERCP: repeat ERCP when bleeding stops. Today, LFTs looking better, can
   do stent tmrw [**10-9**] if pt looks like she has biliary sepsis given
   elevated WBC to 29. But, pt afebrile, comfortable, mentating well.
   -
   -Tachycardic/hypertensive - did not respond to fluids; gave 5mg IV
   metoprolol with SBP 130s and HR 80s. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to rebound from
   holding BB.
   .
   -Steroids: unclear if started by endo for adrenal insufficiency vs GI
   for Crohn's dz.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She was admitted with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NC) without desaturations. Her white blood cell count (WBC) was elevated yesterday afternoon, but returned to normal levels at 1 AM. The etiology of the leukocytosis is unclear, but may be related to steroids, C. difficile, or pre-renal causes. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and hypertension, which was treated with metoprolol. She has also been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated yesterday, but may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a central line and has been experiencing leukocytosis, which may indicate the presence of bacteremia. The patient does not meet the SIRS/sepsis criteria, but may still be at risk for sepsis.
3. Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis: The patient's abdominal pain and leukocytosis may be related to her underlying Crohn's disease, but may also be indicative of a more serious condition such as ischemic colitis or pancreatitis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be related to her underlying nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may be related to her underlying Crohn's disease or ischemic colitis.
6. Short Gut Syndrome: The patient's short gut syndrome may lead to malabsorption of nutrients and electrolytes, which may require close monitoring and management.
7. Infection: The patient has a central line and may be at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
8. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which may require aggressive management.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and leukocytosis, and consider further evaluation with imaging studies or endoscopy.
3. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further evaluation with imaging studies or endoscopy.
5. Continue to manage the patient's short gut syndrome with close monitoring of electrolytes and nutrition.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and sepsis, and consider further evaluation with imaging studies or endoscopy.
7. Consult with the patient's gastroenterologist and surgeon to determine the best course of management for her underlying Crohn's disease and short gut syndrome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and previous abdominal surgeries, including ileostomy and cholecystectomy. She was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of biliary obstruction and was found to have a biliary stent in place.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.3°C, Tcurrent 37.1°C, HR 71 bpm, BP 114/54 mmHg, RR 13 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 15.1 K/μL, Hct 26.4%, Plt 232 K/μL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, TCO2 28 mmHg, Glucose 153 mg/dL, ALT 86 IU/L, AST 80 IU/L, Alk Phos 344 IU/L, T Bili 4.8 mg/dL, Amylase 90 IU/L, Lipase 23 IU/L, Differential-Neuts 91.1%, Lymph 4.2%, Mono 4.2%, Eos 0.4%, Fibrinogen 615 mg/dL, LDH 381 IU/L, Ca++ 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.2 mg/dL, PO4 2.8 mg/dL.
* Imaging: No new imaging was performed.
* Microbiology: The patient has GNR/staph bacteremia, with a pending culture result.
* Assessment and plan:
	+ The patient has biliary obstruction, leukocytosis, blood loss anemia, and bleeding from the biliary tree.
	+ She has GNR/staph bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
	+ The patient's bilirubin is decreasing slowly, and the plan is to repeat ERCP and possibly replace the stent.
	+ She is being managed with active T and C, and her goal Hct is 25.
	+ The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and adrenal insufficiency, and is being tapered off hydrocortisone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's bacteremia and potential source of infection in the biliary tree.
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and history of bleeding from the biliary tree.
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, given the patient's immunocompromised state.
* Nutritional deficiencies due to the patient's short gut syndrome and history of malnutrition.
* Adrenal insufficiency exacerbation due to the tapering of hydrocortisone.
* Potential complications related to the patient's Crohn's disease, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her for signs of sepsis, bleeding, and other complications, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   67 yo F w/ Crohn
s ds s/p multiple prior abd surgeries, ileostomy,
   short gut syndrome, h/o cholelithiasis s/p recent biliary stent
   placement presents with pre-sepsis in setting of recurrent biliary
   obstruction. Now s/p repeat ERCP with evidence of clot and bleeding
   from biliary tree.
   Issues include:
   Biliary obstruction
   Leukocytosis
   Blood loss anemia, bleeding from biliary tree (stabilized)
   GNR/staph bacteremia
   Crohn
   H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   Short gut syndrome
   Biliary obstruction appears [**3-14**] stones and clot from prior biliary
   stent trauma/bleeding. Stent now removed. Her bilirubin is slowly
   decreasing.  Her wbc remains stably elevated and may be [**3-14**] infection
   or stress sterioids.  Bl cx
s now pos for GNR/staph. On vanco/zosyn
   awaiting sensitivities.  D/w surgery regarding possibility of infected
   port given staph in addition to biliary infection.  Low threshold for
   double PSA coverage in setting of clinical decline, though at this time
   appears to be responding well to current regimen.  Will send
   surveillancecx
s and monitor.  Will address with ERCP team plan for
   repeat procedure and possibly stent replacement now that bleeding has
   stabilized.  Maintain active T and C, follow hcts, goal hct 25.
   Coagulopathy was likely nutritional related in setting of short gut
   syndrome, now corrected. Tachycardia and hypertension likely from
   agitation/pain/anxiety as well as possibly withdrawal from beta
   blocker--nowresolved. CROHNS and history of ? adrenal insufficiency
will taper stress hydrocort to IV equivalent of home steroid dose
   while NPO.  Continue maintenance IVFs while NPO for procedure. Continue
   co-management with surgical team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Biliary obstruction appears [**3-14**] stones and clot from prior biliary
   stent trauma/bleeding. Stent now removed. Her bilirubin is slowly
   decreasing.  Her wbc remains stably elevated and may be [**3-14**] infection
   or stress sterioids.  Bl cx

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and cholelithiasis, who presented with sepsis and biliary obstruction. The patient has undergone multiple abdominal surgeries, including ileostomy and recent biliary stent placement.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/54 mmHg.
* Respiratory status: SpO2 of 97% on nasal cannula oxygen.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: stable, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) of 14 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: the patient has received 4,869 mL of fluid and lost 1,775 mL of fluid, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 3,094 mL.
* Laboratory results: the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, with a value of 233 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 10.6 g/dL, and the platelet count (PLT) is 232 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL, and the creatinine (Cr) level is 0.9 mg/dL.
* Imaging: no new imaging studies have been performed.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* The patient has a history of recurrent biliary obstruction and has undergone recent ERCP with evidence of clot and bleeding from the biliary tree.
* The patient has a positive blood culture for GNR/staph, and is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
* The patient has a history of short gut syndrome and is at risk for malnutrition and dehydration.
* The patient's Crohn's disease is being managed with stress hydrocortisone, and the patient is being tapered off stress hydrocortisone while NPO.
* The patient's coagulopathy has been corrected, and the patient is being monitored for signs of bleeding.
* The patient's tachycardia and hypertension are being managed with beta blockers and vasodilators.
* The patient's biliary obstruction is being managed with ERCP and stent placement, and the patient is being considered for repeat ERCP and stent replacement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bacterial sepsis and septic shock
* Biliary obstruction and pancreatitis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhage
* Malnutrition and dehydration
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Tachycardia and hypertension
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Infection and sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal failure

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, bleeding, and organ dysfunction. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted as necessary to address any complications that arise."
