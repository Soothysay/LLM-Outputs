You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastases who was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. She underwent fasciotomy on [**12-10**] for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She has had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was treated with Adenosine and converted to sinus rhythm.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy
* Compartment syndrome of the left leg, which was treated with fasciotomy and closure
* Normocytic anemia with a baseline hemoglobin level of around 30

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Diltiazem 60mg po tid for SVT
* Coumadin restarted last night with an INR > 2.0
* Cefazolin perioperatively for closure of fasciotomy
* IVFs and replete lytes prn
* Regular diet
* PPI, coumadin, and bowel regimen

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 128/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.1%
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Recurrence of SVT
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) despite coumadin therapy
* Complications related to compartment syndrome, such as nerve damage or muscle weakness
* Anemia worsening or bleeding complications due to low platelet count
* Metastatic disease progression or spread to other organs

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and medication regimen to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, was admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hypotension after a recent bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis and fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She underwent surgery to close the fasciotomy wound without complication. However, she experienced SVT again last night, which was converted to sinus rhythm with adenosine. Heparin infusion was stopped due to concerns of allergic reaction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm and blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg. She is receiving IV fluids, oxygen, and antibiotics. Laboratory results show normocytic anemia, with a HCT of 32.1%. The patient's condition is being monitored, and plans are in place for anticoagulation and further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged SVT or atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of SVT and the recent episode may indicate a higher risk for future episodes, which could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
2. Allergic reaction to heparin: The patient's reaction to heparin infusion may indicate an allergic response, which could lead to anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions if not properly managed.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of liver metastases and recent surgery may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if anticoagulation therapy is not properly managed.
4. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and indwelling lines may increase the risk of infection, particularly if proper infection control measures are not in place.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of PE and recent surgery may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSCLC and liver metastases may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of NSCLC and liver metastases may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of NSCLC with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral PEs and developed compartment syndrome in her left calf, requiring fasciotomy. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension, which was converted to sinus rhythm with adenosine. She underwent closure of the fasciotomy wound in the OR yesterday and was started on heparin, but had to stop it due to an allergic reaction. She has a history of allergies to morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her laboratory results show a normocytic anemia with a HCT of 32.1%, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. She is currently on various medications, including Coumadin, Adenosine, and Cefazolin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. PEs: The patient's bilateral PEs are likely secondary to her known metastatic malignancy. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to various causes, including recent surgery, missed doses of diltiazem, new PE, hyperthyroidism, or MI. Monitoring on telemetry and restarting diltiazem may help manage this condition.
3. Normocytic anemia: The patient's anemia may be fluctuating due to recent surgery. Monitoring daily HCTs and transfusing for HCT <24 may be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation may be due to her recent surgery and may require bowel regimen and prophylactic medications.
5. Headache: The patient's headache may be due to various causes, including recent surgery, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions.
6. Wound complications: The patient's wound may be at risk for complications, including infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing. Close monitoring and wound care may be necessary to prevent these complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may fluctuate due to her recent surgery and may require close monitoring and adjustments to her medications and fluids.
8. Infection: The patient may be at risk for infection due to her recent surgery and may require prophylactic antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of infection."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission who has undergone fasciotomy closure without complications. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. The patient has experienced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was converted to sinus rhythm (SR) with adenosine. The patient received heparin, but it was stopped due to concerns of an allergic reaction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/66 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show normal ranges for complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests.

The patient's assessment and plan include constipation, SVT, and headache. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrence of SVT: The patient's history of SVT and the need for adenosine conversion to SR suggest a risk of recurrent SVT.
2. Allergic reaction to heparin: The patient's reaction to heparin may indicate an allergy, which could lead to anaphylaxis or other severe reactions if heparin is re-administered.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, which could cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
4. Headache: The patient's headache may be a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which could lead to cerebral edema and neurological deterioration.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of antibiotics increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's use of heparin and history of DVT suggest a risk of recurrent DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of corticosteroids and history of stress ulcer suggest a risk of recurrent stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had undergone right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and had developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) one month prior. She was admitted to the ICU with a left calf compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy and closure. She also developed atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) twice, which was treated with adenosine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 157/67 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with crackles throughout the right side of her chest.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. Her blood chemistry results are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated troponin-T level of 0.04 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* S/p fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome
* S/p AVNRT x2, which resolved with adenosine
* Continued pain management with dilaudid
* Bowel regimen and ortho recs
* CXR to assess for possible fluid overload
* Long-term anticoagulation with coumadin or lovenox, depending on the patient's primary oncologist's decision
* Diltiazem 60mg PO tid restarted overnight, with a plan to increase to q6Hr
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Fluid overload, which could worsen the patient's respiratory status
* Pulmonary embolism, which could be exacerbated by the patient's history of PE
* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which could be precipitated by the patient's underlying heart disease and electrolyte imbalances
* Infection, which could be caused by the patient's indwelling catheters or other invasive devices
* Hemorrhage, which could occur due to the patient's coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia
* Metastatic disease progression, which could lead to further complications and worsen the patient's overall prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   note, including assessment and plan. Recurrent episode of SVT
   overnight, requiring adenosine.  Currently in sinus rhythm, though
   tachycardic. Suboptimal pain control likely contributing. Plan to
   increase diltiazem and pain regimen. Appears okay for floor transfer.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, bilateral PE, and AVNRT. She was admitted to the ICU due to a left calf compartment syndrome and subsequent fasciotomy. The patient has experienced two episodes of AVNRT, which were resolved with adenosine. The note highlights several potential medical complications, including:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's lung crackles suggest possible fluid overload, which could be exacerbated by her underlying respiratory issues.
2. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, with a baseline of 90's and reaching 110's during the episode of AVNRT. The etiology of this tachycardia is unclear and requires further evaluation.
3. Poor pain control: The patient's pain score is only 4-9 out of 10, indicating suboptimal pain control. This could be contributing to her tachycardia and other complications.
4. Risk of bleeding: The patient is on Coumadin for prophylaxis against DVT and has a history of PE. This increases her risk of bleeding, particularly with the potential for further anticoagulation with Lovenox.
5. Potential for cardiac issues: The patient's history of NSCLC, bilateral PE, and AVNRT suggests a high risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and ischemia.
6. Nutritional concerns: The patient is on a cardiac PO diet, which may not be optimal for her nutritional needs.
7. Potential for medication interactions: The patient is taking multiple medications, including Coumadin, Lovenox, and diltiazem, which may interact with each other and increase the risk of adverse effects.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of fluid status and respiratory function to prevent fluid overload.
2. Further evaluation of the patient's tachycardia, including a 12-lead ECG and possible stress testing.
3. Optimization of pain control to reduce the patient's tachycardia and improve her overall comfort.
4. Careful management of the patient's anticoagulation therapy to minimize the risk of bleeding.
5. Ongoing monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and potential for cardiac complications.
6. Nutritional assessment and optimization to ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition.
7. Regular medication reviews to identify potential interactions and optimize the patient's medication regimen."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with liver metastases, who has recently been diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE) and underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been managed with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers in the past. Currently, she is on max dose oral diltiazem and has had multiple episodes of SVT, which have been terminated with adenosine. The patient's INR is elevated, and coumadin has been restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of SVT and the need for frequent adenosine administration may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart block.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated INR and use of coumadin may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematuria.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's bilateral PE may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and recent surgery may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord compression.
5. Infection complications: The patient's recent surgery and use of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection complications, such as surgical site infections or sepsis.
6. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's history of metastatic NSCLC may increase the risk of disease progression and spread to other organs.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust coumadin dosing as needed to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide supportive care as needed to prevent respiratory complications.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and provide supportive care as needed to prevent neurological complications.
5. Monitor the patient's infection status closely and provide antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent infection complications.
6. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's metastatic NSCLC, including palliative care and symptom management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is still receiving Coumadin, despite being scheduled for transfer to the floor, due to a peak in SVT to 170-190 bpm and concerns about further uptitration of dilt.
* The patient has a history of delirium and confusion, and is currently experiencing nausea and vomiting.
* The patient has a codeine allergy and is receiving other medications, including Adenosine, Oxycontin, and Prednisone.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.4°C, Tcurrent of 36.2°C, HR of 93 bpm, BP of 147/63 mmHg, RR of 17 breaths/min, and SpO2 of 96%.
* The patient has a history of constipation, supraventricular tachycardia, and headache.

**Potential Complications:**

* Prolonged use of Coumadin may lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of falls.
* The patient's history of delirium and confusion may indicate a risk of further cognitive decline or falls.
* The patient's nausea and vomiting may indicate a risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
* The patient's supraventricular tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure.
* The patient's history of constipation may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation.
* The patient's codeine allergy may indicate a risk of allergic reaction to other medications.
* The patient's history of DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis may indicate a risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to address the patient's nausea and vomiting.
* Consult with the patient's primary care physician to discuss the patient's codeine allergy and potential alternatives.
* Consider ordering additional laboratory tests to rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.
* Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.
* Consider consulting with a cardiologist to discuss the patient's supraventricular tachycardia and potential treatment options."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who recently underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient has experienced two episodes of SVT, with the second episode occurring last night. The patient's tachycardia is likely related to compartment syndrome of the left leg.
2. Bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of bilateral PE, which is likely secondary to her known metastatic malignancy.
3. Normocytic anemia: The patient has a hematocrit (HCT) of 26.8%, which is stable over this hospitalization.
4. Metastatic NSCLC: The patient's cancer is not actively being treated during this hospitalization.

The patient is receiving the following medications:

1. Diltiazem: 60mg PO tid for SVT
2. Coumadin: Restarted last night, with an INR > 2.0
3. Adenosine: PRN for SVT
4. Cefazolin: Perioperative antibiotic for compartment syndrome
5. Prednisone: Not specified

The patient's vital signs are:

1. Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
2. Heart rate: 93 bpm (91-183 bpm)
3. Blood pressure: 147/63 mmHg (79-161/102 mmHg)
4. Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (9-23 breaths per minute)
5. Oxygen saturation: 96%
6. Blood glucose: 146 mg/dL

The patient's laboratory results are:

1. White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
2. Hematocrit: 32.1%
3. Platelet count: 261 K/uL
4. Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
5. Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
6. Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
7. Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
8. Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent SVT and tachycardia, which may require further interventions such as cardioversion or ablation.
2. Pulmonary embolism recurrence, which may require further anticoagulation therapy.
3. Compartment syndrome recurrence, which may require further surgical interventions.
4. Anemia worsening, which may require transfusions.
5. Metastatic cancer progression, which may require further cancer treatment.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions closely to prevent or manage potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and is currently in the ICU due to compartment syndrome of the left calf, which required fasciotomy and closure. She also had two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) that resolved with adenosine. The patient's current vital signs are: temperature 36.2°C, heart rate 93 beats per minute, blood pressure 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. She has a slight fever and is receiving antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid Overload: The patient's lung crackles may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to respiratory distress and cardiac complications.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy. The risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism is high, and close monitoring is necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's sinus tachycardia may progress to atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Infection: The patient's compartment syndrome and recent surgery increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and recent surgery increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's lung crackles and possible fluid overload increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiac function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and recently developed left calf compartment syndrome, which required fasciotomy and closure. She also experienced atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) and was treated with adenosine.

Currently, the patient is experiencing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute, which is being managed with diltiazem 60mg PO q6Hr. Her blood pressure is 147/63 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. She is receiving cardiac PO diet and has good glucose control.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of SVT and AVNRT, there is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of bilateral PE and ongoing anticoagulation with coumadin increase the risk of recurrent PE.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient's recent development of left calf compartment syndrome highlights the risk of further compartment syndromes in other extremities.
4. Wound complications: The patient's recent surgery and fasciotomy may increase the risk of wound complications, including infection or dehiscence.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung cancer and recent PE may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she develops further cardiac arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism.

Based on this information, I recommend close monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm, pulmonary status, and wound healing, as well as ongoing anticoagulation with coumadin and management of her SVT with diltiazem."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She is doing better with IV esmolol now and has no issues with
   recurrent SVT. She does not tolerate HR when greater than 140 well. She
   is due to have EP evaluation in am [**2188-12-15**]. We will hold
   anticoagulation for this and when cleared start low dose coumadin for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, bilateral PE, and s/p RML lobectomy and chemo. She is currently in the ICU due to a recent fasciotomy and closure for L calf compartment syndrome [**3-10**] hematoma and s/p AVNRT. The patient has had multiple episodes of SVT, which have been managed with adenosine and other medications. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is receiving various medications, including adenosine, ativan, and dilaudid, to manage her SVT and pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of SVT and recent episodes of tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of PE and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
4. Infection: The patient's history of PE and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory or urinary tract.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of PE and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the respiratory or urinary tract.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's history of PE and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly in the deep veins of the legs.
7. Chronic illness: The patient's history of metastatic NSCLC and recent episodes of SVT may increase her risk of chronic illness, particularly cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm closely.
2. Consider ordering further cardiac testing, such as an echocardiogram or stress test, to assess the patient's cardiac function.
3. Consider ordering further respiratory testing, such as a pulmonary function test or arterial blood gas analysis, to assess the patient's respiratory function.
4. Consider ordering further neurological testing, such as a head computed tomography (CT) scan or electroencephalogram (EEG), to assess the patient's neurological function.
5. Consider ordering further infection testing, such as a complete blood count (CBC) or blood culture, to assess the patient's risk of infection.
6. Consider ordering further bleeding testing, such as a prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), to assess the patient's bleeding risk.
7. Consider ordering further venous thromboembolism testing, such as a Doppler ultrasound or venous duplex ultrasound, to assess the patient's risk of venous thromboembolism.
8. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or pulmonologist to further assess the patient's cardiac and respiratory function.
9. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further assess the patient's neurological function.
10. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to further assess the patient's risk of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) in the past. She recently underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome due to a hematoma. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which have been treated with adenosine. Her current medications include diltiazem, lopressor, ativan, and dilaudid.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is notable for tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or gallop.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/μL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 261 K/μL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.04 ng/mL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes management of her SVT, continued pain medication, bowel regimen, and orthotic recommendations. Her coumadin has been held due to her recent surgery, and she will be monitored for INR levels. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management of her SVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT and recent surgery may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of bilateral PE and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing further pulmonary emboli.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient's recent surgery for compartment syndrome may increase her risk of developing further compartment syndromes, particularly in other extremities.
4. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing infections, particularly in the surgical site or urinary tract.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the surgical site or other areas where the patient has been catheterized.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly if she experiences further complications or develops a respiratory infection.
7. Renal failure: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing renal failure, particularly if she experiences further complications or develops a urinary tract infection."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   79 yo F with F with history of NSCLC with liver mets with recent
   bilateral PE diagnosis now s/p fasciotomy on [**12-10**] for left calf
   hematoma-related compartment syndrome, transferred to MICU for
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   #  SVT:  Pt has a long hx of SVT. Likely AVNRT. Previously, she was
   always able to manage this with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers. After 7
   episodes of AVRNT yesterday morning, that would briefly convert and
   recur, esmolol gtt was started. This seems to have worked well. HR
   maintained in the 80s. All episodes have been symptomatic.
   - plan for EPS and ablation today
   - cont esmolol gtt
d/c-ed all other BB and CCBs
   -coumadin restarted, INR > 2.0, hold today
s dose in anticipation of
   procedure tomorrw
   -continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # bilateral PEs: likely secondary to known metastatic malignancy.
   Heparin attempted last night but patient became tachycardic and felt
   hot.  Would recommend to not use heparin in the future.  Restarted
   coumadin which she tolerated well
   - cont coumadin
holding today in the setting of procedure
   - follow INR
   -  Onc OK with coumadin over lovenox evening setting of maligancy

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism and had a fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has a long history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been managed with diltiazem and vagal maneuvers. However, she had 7 episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) yesterday morning, which were managed with esmolol infusion. The plan is to perform an electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation today.

The patient's current vital signs are: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 100/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -564 mL, and she is receiving esmolol infusion at 75 mcg/kg/min. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 294 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrence of SVT: The patient's history of SVT and recent episodes of AVNRT suggest a high risk of recurrence. Close monitoring and prompt management with esmolol infusion or other anti-arrhythmic medications may be necessary.
2. Complications from electrophysiology study and ablation: The patient is scheduled to undergo EPS and ablation today, which carries a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, and arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary embolism increases her risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and current use of fosaprepitant may increase her risk of constipation. Close monitoring and management with laxatives or stool softeners may be necessary.
5. Normocytic anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia may be exacerbated by her recent surgery and may require transfusion.
6. Metastatic cancer: The patient's metastatic non-small cell lung cancer may continue to progress and require further treatment. Close monitoring and management with oncologists may be necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with liver metastases, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with a SpO2 of 100% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a distended and tense abdomen, without tenderness or guarding. Her extremities are without peripheral edema, and her pulses are 2+. Her neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a normocytic anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.6%. Her white blood cell count is 7.7 K/uL, and her platelet count is 294 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.04 ng/mL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L and a magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs), which are likely secondary to her known metastatic malignancy. She had a fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome and has been treated with heparin and coumadin in the past. Her current anticoagulation regimen consists of coumadin, which she tolerates well.

The patient's medications include esmolol, metoprolol, adenosine, hydromorphone, and cefazolin. She has been prescribed a low-dose beta blocker and is being monitored on telemetry.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Recurrence of bilateral PEs: The patient's history of PEs and metastatic malignancy make her at risk for recurrent PEs, which can be life-threatening.
2. Complications from liver metastases: The patient's liver metastases can cause a range of complications, including liver failure, ascites, and portal hypertension.
3. Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and history of PEs make her at risk for infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension can lead to cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and metastatic malignancy can cause neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. Her anticoagulation regimen should be continued, and her anemia should be monitored and treated as necessary. Her respiratory and cardiovascular status should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly for any signs of infection or cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old admitted to the ICU with a rapid heart rate. They had an episode of AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia) in the morning, which was treated with adenosine. The patient received 11 doses of adenosine over the course of the morning and was started on esmolol infusion. An electrocardiogram (ECG) consultation was performed, and the plan is to proceed with ablation this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 7.7 K/uL, and their hemoglobin level is 9.9 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular: The patient's history of AVNRT and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) may increase their risk of developing arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The esmolol infusion may help to control the heart rate, but the patient may require further management to prevent arrhythmias.
2. Renal: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate underlying kidney damage. The patient's urine output is stable, but they may require further monitoring to ensure that their renal function remains stable.
3. Gastrointestinal: The patient's constipation may worsen if they do not receive adequate hydration and nutrition. The patient may require further management, including the use of laxatives or enemas, to prevent constipation.
4. Neurological: The patient's headache may be related to their underlying medical condition or medication side effects. The patient may require further evaluation to determine the cause of their headache and to manage their symptoms.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient's temperature is normal, but they may require further evaluation to determine if they have an underlying infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including their heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's arrhythmias with esmolol infusion and consider further management, including the use of anti-arrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further management, including the use of diuretics or dialysis, if necessary.
4. Manage the patient's constipation with adequate hydration and nutrition, and consider the use of laxatives or enemas if necessary.
5. Evaluate the patient's headache and manage their symptoms with pain medication or other appropriate therapies.
6. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider further evaluation if the patient's temperature is elevated or if they have other signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, s/p RML lobectomy and chemo, and bilateral PE. She is currently in the ICU due to complications from surgery, including a compartment syndrome, AVNRT, and PE.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her neurological status is also stable, with the patient attentive and responsive.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. The first is the risk of bleeding due to her supratherapeutic INR and recent surgery. The second is the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her PE and Coumadin therapy. The third is the risk of arrhythmias due to her AVNRT and Esmolol therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show stable renal function, with a creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and stable liver function, with a bilirubin of 0.8 mg/dL. Her electrolytes are also stable, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and a sodium level of 137 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a right-sided effusion on chest X-ray, which has improved since her previous imaging study. There are no other imaging abnormalities noted.

The patient's plan of care includes continued ICU care, with a focus on stabilizing her heart rate issues after the EP study. She will also continue to receive pain management with Dilaudid, bowel regimen, and ortho recommendations. The patient's primary oncologist will need to weigh the risk-benefit of Lovenox versus Coumadin for this oncology patient.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU until her heart rate issues have stabilized after the EP study, and then she will be transferred to the floor on PO medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent a right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequently underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome.

The patient has been experiencing atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) twice, which resolved with adenosine administration. She is currently receiving esmolol infusion and is scheduled for an electrophysiology (EP) study today.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 73 bpm
* Blood pressure: 99/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion, which has improved since the previous day.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continued pain management with dilaudid
* Bowel regimen
* Orthopedic recommendations
* Esmolol infusion
* EP study today
* Coumadin therapy with supratherapeutic INR, and vit K and FFP for EP study today
* Long-term consideration of lovenox versus coumadin therapy for the patient's oncology condition

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and PE
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including AVNRT, which may recur
* Infection, particularly in the context of the patient's compromised immune system and central line
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and anticoagulation therapy
* Renal failure, particularly if the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise
* Sepsis, which may be triggered by the patient's underlying condition and potential infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, followed by bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) one month ago. She was admitted to the ICU for compartment syndrome and AVNRT (atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia) which resolved with adenosine. The patient is currently receiving esmolol, metoprolol, and hydromorphone for heart rate control and pain management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 2 L. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with clear breath sounds and no signs of distress. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with the patient being attentive and responsive to verbal commands.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L and a sodium level of 137 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's CXR shows right effusion, which may be related to fluid overload. The patient's fluid balance is also positive, with a total fluid input of 1,076 mL and a total fluid output of 1,640 mL.
2. AVNRT recurrence: The patient has had two episodes of AVNRT, which resolved with adenosine. However, there is a risk of recurrence, especially with the patient's history of bilateral PE.
3. Bleeding risk: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with coumadin, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Infection risk: The patient has a central line and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, and the patient is receiving multiple medications for heart rate control. There is a risk of cardiovascular instability, especially with the patient's history of bilateral PE.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure, especially with the patient's history of bilateral PE and fluid overload.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis, especially with the patient's history of bilateral PE and the presence of central lines.
8. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may be related to fluid overload or other underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and compartment syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for fasciotomy and closure of left calf compartment syndrome. The patient had two episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) that resolved with adenosine. She is currently receiving esmolol infusion and is scheduled for an electrophysiology (EP) study today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/48 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 2 L. Her respiratory support includes a nasal cannula with a flow rate of 2 L.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 0.04 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL. Her imaging studies show a right effusion that has improved since the previous day.

The patient's plan includes continued pain management with dilaudid, bowel regimen, and orthopedic recommendations. She is also scheduled for an EP study today and will receive vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct her supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). Her long-term anticoagulation plan will be determined by her primary oncologist.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of bilateral PE and compartment syndrome increases her risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AVNRT and her current esmolol infusion increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and history of compartment syndrome increase her risk of infection. Close monitoring of her temperature and white blood cell count is necessary.
4. Bleeding: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of compartment syndrome increase her risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her platelet count and hemoglobin level is necessary.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and her current creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL increase her risk of renal failure. Close monitoring of her creatinine level and urine output is necessary.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and her current bowel regimen increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of her stool output and hemoglobin level is necessary.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of bilateral PE and her current anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of deep vein thrombosis. Close monitoring of her lower extremities for signs of thrombosis is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and liver metastases, who was admitted to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. She underwent a successful ablation procedure for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was started on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. 

The patient experienced wheezing after the procedure, which was treated with Lasix 20mg IV with good response. She also had abdominal pain, which resolved overnight. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. 

The patient has a history of bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and liver metastases, which is likely contributing to her tachycardia and hypotension. Heparin was attempted in the past but was stopped due to tachycardia and hot flashes. Coumadin was restarted and is being closely monitored. 

The patient's laboratory results show a normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and a hematocrit of 28.9%. Her platelet count is 261 K/uL, and her white blood cell count is 7.7 K/uL. Her liver function tests are slightly elevated, with a bilirubin level of 0.8 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 109 mg/dL. 

The patient's plan includes continuing metoprolol and monitoring her on telemetry. She will be restarted on coumadin tomorrow and will have her INR closely monitored. Her oncologist is aware of her coumadin use and has given permission for its use over low-molecular-weight heparin in the setting of malignancy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding due to the patient's low platelet count and use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Respiratory failure due to her bilateral PEs and potential for further thrombotic events.
3. Infection due to her immunocompromised state and use of central venous catheters.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to her use of anticoagulant medications and potential for gastrointestinal ulcers.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias due to her SVT and potential for further cardiac complications.
6. Metastatic spread of her NSCLC, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and poor prognosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with liver metastases, who was recently diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and underwent fasciotomy for left calf hematoma-related compartment syndrome. She was transferred to the MICU for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient underwent successful ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is currently being monitored on telemetry. She has a history of constipation, headache, and normocytic anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 131/74 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. She has a central line and an arterial line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7-8.5 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 28.8-32.1%
* Platelet count: 261-304 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.03-0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 109-146 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* PEs: The patient has a history of bilateral PEs, which may increase her risk of further thrombotic events.
* Normocytic anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her underlying malignancy or chemotherapy.
* Constipation: The patient's constipation may be related to her medication regimen or underlying medical conditions.
* Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient's SVT may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Headache: The patient's headache may be related to her underlying medical conditions or medication side effects.

Recommendations:

* Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for any changes.
* Continue to monitor the patient's SVT on telemetry and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
* Consider restarting coumadin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
* Continue to manage the patient's constipation and headache symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes.
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as necessary.
* Consider consulting with a palliative care team to address the patient's symptom burden and quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient underwent an ablation procedure yesterday, which was deemed successful by the EP fellow. However, the patient experienced wheezing and increased vascular congestion after the procedure, which was treated with Lasix 20mg IV with good response. The patient has a history of allergies to Morphine, Oxycontin, Penicillins, and Prednisone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/74 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's respiratory support includes SpO2 monitoring.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.7-8.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.8-33.6%
* Platelet count: 261-308 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03-0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 109-146 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to assess certain areas, such as the peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory systems.

The patient's assessment and plan include constipation, supraventricular tachycardia, and headache. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Respiratory failure due to increased vascular congestion
* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest
* Constipation, which can lead to bowel obstruction and other complications
* Headache, which can be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition
* Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which can arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's platelet count and the use of anticoagulant medications
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which can arise from the patient's medications and laboratory results."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy. She developed bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome. She also required EP ablation for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg, and a sinus tachycardia rhythm.
* Respiratory support is not required, with an SpO2 of 95%.
* The patient is receiving metoprolol, furosemide, and hydromorphone for pain management.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL.
* Imaging studies reveal pulmonary edema with right effusion.
* The patient is receiving coumadin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema with right effusion may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia rhythm and potential cardiac arrhythmias may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection.
4. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of DVT and receiving coumadin may increase the risk of thrombotic events such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to complications such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of compartment syndrome and potential neurological deficits may increase the risk of neurological complications such as paralysis or cognitive impairment.
7. Oncological complications: The patient's history of metastatic NSCLC may lead to complications such as tumor progression or recurrence.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE), was admitted to the ICU for fasciotomy and closure of left calf compartment syndrome and EP ablation for atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). The patient underwent EP ablation yesterday and is currently receiving metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, and their heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination is significant for right lower extremity edema, which is absent, and left lower extremity edema, which is also absent. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with a slight increase in white blood cell count. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte levels are stable, with a slight increase in potassium and magnesium levels.

Imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right-sided effusion, which is consistent with the patient's underlying lung cancer and pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's underlying lung cancer and pulmonary embolism, there is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient develops further pulmonary edema or effusion.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of AVNRT and recent EP ablation increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and chemotherapy increases the risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of PE and current use of coumadin increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of bowel obstruction and current use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage potential complications, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who underwent right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). She recently underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and had an episode of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring EP ablation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 132/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished, no acute distress
* PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light)
* Normocephalic
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Respiratory: clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present
* Extremities: no lower extremity edema
* Skin: not assessed
* Neurologic: attentive, responds to stimuli, but movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Glucose: 146 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and differential neutrophil count are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right-sided effusion.

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Metastatic NSCLC
* Bilateral PE
* Calf compartment syndrome
* AVNRT
* Pulmonary edema with right-sided effusion
* Possible precipitant for AVNRT is unclear but may include the surgery

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and PE
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including AVNRT and atrial fibrillation
* Sepsis due to potential infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections
* Thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
* Neurological complications, including stroke and seizures
* Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and bowel obstruction
* Renal failure due to dehydration and hypotension
* Cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and myocardial infarction

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended to continue close monitoring and management of her medical conditions, including anticoagulation therapy, pain management, and respiratory support. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address the patient's ongoing medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, s/p right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE). She underwent fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and s/p atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) requiring epicardial ablation.

The patient has been experiencing wheezing after the procedure, which was diuresed with improvement. She was started on metoprolol 12.5mg and has not had any further episodes of SVT. She also experienced abdominal pain after the procedure, which resolved with disimpaction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, hydromorphone, and metoprolol. She has also been receiving antibiotic treatment, which was stopped on [**2188-12-16**] 08:50 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with a slight increase in white blood cell count. Her platelet count is within normal limits. Her liver enzymes and renal function tests are normal. Her troponin-T level is normal, and her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema with right effusion, which was confirmed by imaging studies. She has also been diagnosed with compartment syndrome and post-operative fasciotomy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema with right effusion may lead to respiratory failure, especially if not treated promptly.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and chemotherapy may increase her risk of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding, especially if her platelet count is low.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AVNRT and sinus tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially if her heart rhythm is not monitored closely.
5. Compartment syndrome: The patient's history of compartment syndrome may lead to further complications, such as nerve damage or muscle weakness, if not treated promptly.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of bilateral pulmonary embolism may increase her risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism, especially if she is not receiving adequate anticoagulation therapy.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, including pulmonary edema with right effusion, compartment syndrome, and post-operative fasciotomy. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, s/p right middle lobe lobectomy and chemotherapy, and bilateral pulmonary embolism. She has undergone fasciotomy and closure for left calf compartment syndrome and has a history of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).

The patient is currently in the ICU after undergoing an electrophysiology (EP) ablation procedure. She experienced wheezing after the procedure, which was diuresed with improvement. She was also started on metoprolol 12.5mg.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable cardiac output and adequate blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show a slight decrease in hemoglobin levels, with a value of 9.3 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is within normal limits, with a value of 7.7 x 10^9/L. Her platelet count is also within normal limits, with a value of 261 x 10^9/L.

The patient's imaging studies show pulmonary edema with right effusion, which may be related to her history of bilateral pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and right effusion may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her history of bilateral pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AVNRT and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications, such as coumadin, may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to her history of cancer and chemotherapy may increase the risk of infection, which could be complicated by her central venous catheter and other invasive devices.
5. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's history of bilateral pulmonary embolism and her use of anticoagulant medications may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, which could be complicated by pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."
