   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - f/u Lipid profile
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Hold ACE in setting of worsening renal function
   - Wean nitro drip as able
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure
   - TTE today to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - will continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip overnight
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will keep NPO for now
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/30 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin and creatinine levels, indicating ongoing cardiac injury and renal dysfunction. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 21.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 366 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 18 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 13 U/L.

The patient's medical history and physical examination findings suggest a high risk of complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current use of amiodarone increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing end-stage renal disease and ongoing nephrotoxicity from medications may worsen her renal function, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and use of anticoagulant medications increase her risk of bleeding complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which may be exacerbated by her immunosuppressed state.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory support and elevated troponin levels may indicate ongoing cardiac injury, which may lead to respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical history to identify potential complications early and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or manage them."

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Unclear timing of NSTEMI and may have been on
   prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Lipid profile in am
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Hold ACE in setting of worsening renal function
   - Wean nitro drip as able
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure
   - TTE in am to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - will continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Will attempt to wean down nitro overnight, however, unable to give PO
   meds given AMS so may need to continue for now until able to take POs
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will keep NPO for now
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Unclear timing of NSTEMI and may have been on
   prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Lipid profile in am
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Hold ACE in setting of worsening renal function
   - Wean nitro drip as able
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure
   - TTE in am to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - will continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Will attempt to wean down nitro overnight, however, unable to give PO
   meds given AMS so may need to continue for now until able to take POs
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will keep NPO for now
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.
   #. GERD: Will continue PPI
   #. HL: will continue statin
   FEN: Cardiac diet post cath
   ACCESS: peripheral line in foot and Right IJ triple lumen which was
   placed at OSH [**2173-3-30**], a-line
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Pain management with  nothing for now given sedation/AMS
   -Bowel regimen with  colace, lactulose per home regimen
   CODE: DNR/DNI - confirmed with daughter. Reversed only for cath.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who was admitted to the ICU with acute CHF exacerbation and NSTEMI. She underwent cardiac catheterization with DES placement in the LAD and LMCA. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status (AMS) due to multiple sedating medications and lack of dialysis. She is currently receiving treatment for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Function: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is not receiving dialysis. This may lead to further deterioration in her renal function, potentially requiring urgent dialysis.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and CHF exacerbation. Her troponin levels are elevated, and she has a reduced ejection fraction. This may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of GERD and is receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy. She may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient is experiencing AMS, which may be due to multiple sedating medications, lack of dialysis, or underlying neurological disorders. This may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of central lines and other invasive devices.
7. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy and has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. She may be at risk for bleeding complications, especially with the use of anticoagulation therapy.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent or minimize these complications and ensure optimal care."

   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE today to assess pump function and WMA

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and had a cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries. She has been experiencing cardiac symptoms, including acute CHF exacerbation, and has been treated with various medications, including aspirin, plavix, statin, and beta blocker.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/30 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a lethargic but arousable patient with a supple neck, soft abdomen, and no extremity edema. Her skin is without stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin and creatinine levels, with a normal white blood cell count and platelet count. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 18 units per liter and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 13 units per liter.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and placement of DES in the LAD and left main coronary arteries increases her risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
2. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and history of acute CHF exacerbation increase her risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury and worsening of renal function.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and use of oxygen therapy increase her risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of stroke and use of sedating medications increase her risk of neurological complications, including seizures and delirium.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and use of anticoagulant medications increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.
6. Infection: The patient's history of recent surgery and use of immunosuppressive medications increase her risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and use of anticoagulant medications increase her risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE today to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip overnight
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat schedule
   . Renal aware, will get HD today
   .
   #. GERD: Will continue PPI

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and was found to have mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. She had a cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient is currently receiving various medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of heart failure and the presence of diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures increase the risk of heart failure exacerbation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the presence of pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of diabetes and the presence of catheters increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and the presence of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Stroke: The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) increase the risk of stroke.
8. Septic shock: The patient's history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) increase the risk of septic shock.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old elderly female in the ICU with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), impaired skin integrity, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She has been dialyzed, with overall even parameters. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/30 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 98% and is receiving oxygen therapy. Her physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure of 7 cm, and her cardiac examination shows a soft S2 sound with early peaking radiating to the carotids.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/μL, hemoglobin of 25.7 g/dL, platelet count of 322 K/μL, and creatinine of 5.2 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L. She has received antibiotics, and her wound is being managed with dressing changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's impaired skin integrity and recent dialysis, she is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's AMI and CAD may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and recent dialysis may increase her risk of developing a wound infection.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L is slightly low, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness if not corrected.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is 311 mL, which may lead to fluid overload and cardiovascular instability if not managed properly.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, which may indicate hemodynamic instability and the need for further monitoring and management.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's lethargy may be a sign of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or sepsis-related encephalopathy."

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Can start ACE as she has end stage renal failure
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip yesterday
   - continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 81-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and has undergone cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries (LMCA).
* She has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
* She has mild aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation and trivial mitral regurgitation.

**Recent Developments:**

* The patient complained of neck and chest pain today, with electrocardiogram (EKG) showing ST depressions laterally and LVH.
* Her blood pressure is 125/30 mmHg, and her heart rate is 72 beats per minute (bpm).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEMI)**: The patient's recent chest pain and EKG changes suggest ongoing ischemia, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. **Heart Failure**: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures may worsen her heart failure symptoms, leading to increased fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, or even cardiac arrest.
3. **Aortic Stenosis**: The patient's mild aortic valve stenosis may worsen over time, leading to increased pressure gradients across the valve, which may cause symptoms such as angina, syncope, or even cardiac arrest.
4. **Mitral Regurgitation**: The patient's trivial mitral regurgitation may worsen over time, leading to increased pressure gradients across the valve, which may cause symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or even cardiac arrest.
5. **Renal Complications**: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) may lead to further complications, such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, or even cardiac arrest.
6. **Infections**: The patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling lines may increase her risk of developing infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) or ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs).
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications**: The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

**Plan:**

1. Continue aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin therapy to manage her cardiovascular risk factors.
2. Monitor her blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes to detect any signs of cardiac complications.
3. Continue hemodialysis (HD) and adjust her fluid management plan to prevent fluid overload.
4. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Continue prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections and monitor for any signs of sepsis.
6. Monitor her gastrointestinal symptoms and adjust her medication regimen as needed to prevent gastrointestinal complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, renal complications, infections, and gastrointestinal complications. Close monitoring and management of her cardiovascular risk factors, fluid management, electrolyte levels, and medication regimen are crucial to prevent these complications and improve her overall outcome."

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL), admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and acute heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries (LMCA). Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, beta blocker, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

The patient's recent laboratory results show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures, and mild aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. Her troponin-T levels are elevated, but creatine kinase (CK) levels are not.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and the presence of LVH, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter or fibrillation.
2. Heart failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation and LVH may lead to further decompensation, resulting in increased symptoms and potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing ESRD and potential acute kidney injury (AKI) from contrast-induced nephropathy or cardiac medications may worsen her renal function, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and need for dialysis.
4. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central venous catheters (CVCs) may increase her risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and other infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and use of anticoagulants, such as warfarin, may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's use of diuretics and potential AKI may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's CHF and potential need for mechanical ventilation may increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of hypertension and potential cardiac medications may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral vasospasm and stroke."

   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - f/u Lipid profile
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Can start ACE as she has end stage renal failure
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE today to assess pump function and WMA
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - Weaned nitro drip overnight
   - Consider changing PO metoprolol to IV for BP control
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: Multiple etiologies for AMS but most likely are: 1. multiple
   sedating medications in both caths today 2. No dialysis since Saturday
   (longest she's ever gone without dialysis).
   - Will check LFTs although reportedly WNL at OSH so unlikely ALF as
   cause of AMS
   - Will monitor overnight and plan for dialysis in am
   - If MS does not improve with dialysis and time for sedation to wear
   out will consider head CT to eval for other pathology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), Hypertension (HTN), and Hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with an acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents in the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and Left Main Coronary Artery (LMCA) arteries.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), Heart Rate 72 beats per minute, Blood Pressure 125/30 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 16 breaths per minute, and SpO2 98%.
* Physical Examination: The patient is lethargic but arousable, with no signs of pallor, cyanosis, or xanthalesma.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 21.0 K/uL, Hct is 25.7%, and Platelet count is 322 K/uL. Her Troponin-T is elevated at 31 mg/dL, and her Creatinine is 5.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she may be at risk for cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) may worsen, and she may require more frequent hemodialysis or consideration for renal transplantation.
* Neurological complications: The patient's lethargic state may be due to her underlying medical condition or the sedating medications she is receiving. She may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
* Infection complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to her ESRD and cardiac condition may increase her risk for infection.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and her current use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continue aspirin and Plavix X for antiplatelet therapy.
* Continue statin and beta blocker therapy for cardiac risk reduction.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue hemodialysis on a regular schedule.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Consider changing the patient's anticoagulation therapy to warfarin if her international normalized ratio (INR) is within a therapeutic range."

   TEE
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.
   Assessment and Plan

   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted to the hospital with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). She has been experiencing chest pain and neck pain, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows ST depressions laterally and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 125/30 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98%, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen. Her respiratory support includes a flow rate of 16 breaths per minute, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a supple neck, a normal cardiac examination, and no signs of respiratory distress. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 21.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 366 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD, HTN, HL, and acute CHF exacerbation one month ago. She has been taking aspirin, clopidogrel, and statins, and has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ST depressions on her EKG suggest ongoing myocardial injury, which may lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and her current oxygen saturation of 98% suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which may worsen if she experiences further complications such as sepsis or hypotension.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GIB and her current use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) suggest that she may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and her current use of antibiotics suggest that she may be at risk for infection, particularly in her respiratory tract or urinary tract.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
   hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
   1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
   Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild aortic
   valve stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted to the ICU with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and acute heart failure exacerbation. She underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient has been experiencing symptoms of shortness of breath, nausea, and chest pain, and has had elevated blood pressures. She has also been experiencing depression and has a history of severe depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is also unstable, and she may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she may be at risk for further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.
4. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk for infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or sepsis, due to her compromised immune system and the presence of indwelling lines and catheters.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and she may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain death, due to her cardiac and respiratory instability.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding, due to her cardiac and respiratory instability.
7. Psychiatric complications: The patient's psychiatric status is compromised, and she may be at risk for further psychiatric complications, such as depression, anxiety, or psychosis, due to her underlying medical conditions and the stress of her hospitalization.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries (LMCA).

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Acute CHF exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF, and her current symptoms, including shortness of breath (SOB), nausea, and chest pain (CP), suggest an exacerbation of her condition.
2. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure (BP) has been elevated, requiring treatment with nitroglycerin and metoprolol.
3. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's EKG shows ST depressions, and her troponin levels are elevated, suggesting ischemic heart disease.
4. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently experiencing symptoms of depression, including feelings of hopelessness and a desire to die.
5. Delirium/dementia: The patient's mental status is impaired, and she is experiencing delirium/dementia, which may be related to her depression or underlying medical conditions.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 8.9 g/dL, indicating anemia.
7. Chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on HD, which may contribute to her anemia and other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ischemic heart disease and CHF exacerbation increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's SOB and CP may indicate respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium/dementia and depression may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of catheterization increase her risk of infectious complications, such as sepsis or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GERD and stress ulcer disease may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

In light of these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted
   hydral this AM.
   -          continue metoprolol
   -          Restart home nifedipine
   #. AMS:  Pt has severe depression.  Most likely her depression is
   causing a pseudo dementia on top of ICU psychosis.  Attempted zyprexa
   last night with not much effect.  Restarted home Zoloft.  Consulted

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted to the ICU with acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and had undergone catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C (97.8°F), HR 75 bpm, BP 201/50 mmHg, RR 16 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressures have been elevated, with readings up to 230s mmHg. She has required additional medication to control her blood pressure, including metoprolol and nitroglycerin.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 501 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a net balance of 1 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute.
* Neurological status: The patient is lethargic but arousable.
* Laboratory results: The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.87 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 3.8 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating ongoing cardiac injury. This could lead to further complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressures have been elevated, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, cerebral edema, or even hypertensive encephalopathy.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids over the past 24 hours, which could lead to fluid overload and further compromise her cardiovascular status.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, but she may require further respiratory support if her oxygenation status deteriorates.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of depression and is currently receiving psychoactive medications. She may be at risk for developing delirium, which could further complicate her clinical course.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly given her prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppressive therapy.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency), renal failure, end-stage (end-stage renal disease, ESRD), impaired skin integrity, myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI), and coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease).

The patient's recent events include:

* 24-hour events: The patient complained of shortness of breath (SOB) and feeling of a ""heart attack"" at 11:16 PM, which was followed by an EKG at 11:45 PM.
* Renal dialysis was scheduled for the day to get back on the T, Th, Sat schedule, and iron studies were ordered for anemia of chronic disease.
* Psych consultation was requested for depression, and the patient reported wanting to die, which was attributed to delirium/dementia. Opiates were avoided, and zoloft was restarted.
* Speech and swallow consultation was requested for subjective dysphagia.
* Social work consultation was requested.
* The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 60s during hemodialysis (HD) as the needle came out of the graft, and one unit of blood was given.
* The patient's mental status is normally very sharp, according to the daughter.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 201/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28.1%
* Platelet count: 366
* Creatinine: 8.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL
* Glucose: 131 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
* Renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and increased risk of infections.
* Myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
* Impaired skin integrity, which can lead to infections, skin breakdown, or delayed wound healing.
* Coronary artery disease, which can lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or angina.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Renal dialysis
* Iron studies
* Psych consultation
* Speech and swallow consultation
* Social work consultation
* Hemodynamic monitoring
* Medications: nitroglycerin, metoprolol, zoloft, and hydralazine.

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below)
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year, most likely continue indefinitely
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   - Discontinue ACE
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - Beta blocker as able
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.
   - continue metoprolol and captopril
   - Avoid hydral as reflex tachycardia would be undesirable in setting of
   NSTEMI
   #. AMS: improved likely was secondary to sedation medication and no
   dialysis..
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, (at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat
   schedule)
   .
   #. GERD: Will continue PPI
   #. HL: will continue statin

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) and had a cardiac catheterization with deployment of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary arteries (LMCA). The patient's current condition is marked by elevated blood pressures, tachycardia, and shortness of breath (SOB). She has been experiencing episodes of SOB and feeling like she is having a ""heart attack.""

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which may be due to the NSTEMI or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Her kidney function is impaired, and she requires dialysis. She also has anemia, which is being managed with iron studies and erythropoietin therapy.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous distension (JVD) of 7 cm, indicating right atrial hypertension. Her cardiac examination shows a soft S2 sound, which may indicate aortic stenosis. Her lung examination is clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's medication list includes aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, captopril, and warfarin. She is also taking a statin, beta blocker, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ongoing myocardial infarction (MI)
	* Left ventricular dysfunction with possible heart failure (HF)
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT)
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension or inadequate dialysis
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
4. Neurological complications:
	* Confusion or delirium due to electrolyte imbalance or medication side effects
	* Seizures or stroke due to hypoxia or hypoperfusion
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to anticoagulation therapy or peptic ulcer disease
	* Nausea and vomiting due to medication side effects or gastrointestinal infections

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81yo F with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, acute CHF exacerbation 1 month
   ago, admitted from OSH with NSTEMI now s/p cath with DES in LAD and
   LMCA.
   # CORONARIES: S/P NSTEMI. Cath at OSH, 80% LAD stenosis.  Cath here two
   DES placed one to LAD distally and one to LM.  Unclear timing of NSTEMI
   and may have been on prior admission (see below).  Had ST depressions
   in the setting of hypertensive urgency last night, most likely demand
   ischemia.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue plavix X at least 1 year
   - Continue statin, beta blocker
   # PUMP:  Had EF 56% on adenosine stress test at OSH per report less
   than one month ago. In retrospect admission for ""multifocal PNA"" was
   more likely for acute CHF exacerbation. With trops elevated on this
   admission but CKs not more likely that she had an ischemic event on
   last admission leading to acute CHF and now the only enzyme elevated is
   troponin because 1) its half life is longer than CK and 2) she had
   renal failure  EKG shows LVH
   - TTE here showed mild LVH, diastolic dysfunction, no regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   - continue beta blocker
   - Monitor daily weights
   # RHYTHM: NSR currently but h/o AF.
   - continue amiodarone
   - Not on coumadin because of history of GIB.
   - ASA for anti-coagulation
   - Will monitor on tele
   # HTN: Patient with h/o severe HTN and elevated pressures in cath lab
   so was started on nitro gtt.   As she did not complete HD yesterday and
   required a blood transfusion overnight, her blood pressures were
   significantly elevated again.  Attempted increase in PO medications,
   however had to restart nitro drip, with not much result.  Attempted
   hydral this AM.  Will likely need HD today
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart home nifedipine
   # AMS:  Pt has severe depression.  Most likely her depression is
   causing a pseudo dementia on top of ICU psychosis.  Attempted zyprexa
   last night with not much effect.  Restarted home Zoloft.  Consulted
   Psych yesterday.  SW to see her today
   # Chronic renal failure:  Continue HD, (at home on T, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat
   schedule)
   # GERD: Will continue PPI
   # HL: will continue statin

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HL). She was admitted with acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left main coronary artery (LMCA). She has been experiencing symptoms of Shortness of Breath (SOB), nausea, and chest pain (CP).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Blood pressure: 201/50 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Temperature: 36.6°C (normal range: 36.5-37.5°C)

The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypertension, including a blood pressure of 230/126 mmHg at 11:45 PM, which was treated with a nitroglycerin drip. She has also been experiencing episodes of tachycardia, including a heart rate of 96 bpm at 11:45 PM.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 21.0 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 366 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 8.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.87 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.1 ng/mL)
* Glucose: 131 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)

The patient's EKG shows ST depressions and a flat T-wave, which may indicate demand ischemia. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.87 ng/mL, which may indicate a recent myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and elevated cardiac enzymes may indicate a high risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, which may lead to a hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure. The patient's history of ESRD and HD may increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Depression: The patient's history of depression and pseudo-dementia may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
6. Medication side effects: The patient's medication regimen, including beta blockers, statins, and anticoagulants, may cause side effects, including hypotension, bradycardia, and bleeding.

Based on the patient's medical history, laboratory results, and clinical presentation, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored for cardiac complications, hypertensive crisis, renal failure, infection, depression, and medication side effects."
