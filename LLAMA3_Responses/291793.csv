   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation: Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation
   with heparin has been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is
   stable at 35.7.  She denies any pain currently.
   - Active type and screen.
   - Immediate Hct check now and trend for q6h
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # CORONARIES: Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH,
   however her CK here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no
   history of chest pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the
   likelihood of CAD high.  She has had no previous catheterizations in
   our system.
   - Defer workup for possible CAD to primary [**Hospital1 1896**] team/outpatient setting
   once her acute situation has resolved.
   - Will continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the
   [**Hospital1 1896**] team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   - Will continue holding her home lasix for now.
   # RHYTHM: She had complete heart block s/p pacemaker placement.
   Admission EKG showed V-paced rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # Tobacco use:
   - Smoking cessation counceling.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 85-year-old female, is being monitored in the ICU for a hematoma following a distal peroneal artery perforation during right leg thrombectomy. She has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and complete heart block with a pacemaker. She is currently being managed for potential complications, including cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematoma expansion: The patient's hematoma is being monitored for potential expansion, which could lead to further complications such as bleeding, hypovolemic shock, or cardiac tamponade.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's history of complete heart block and possible CAD make her susceptible to cardiac ischemia, which could lead to arrhythmias, angina, or even myocardial infarction.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and recent thrombectomy increase her risk of pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure, hypotension, or even death.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation with heparin has been reversed, but she is still at risk for bleeding due to her underlying conditions and recent surgical procedures.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and recent surgical procedures make her susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or even death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and possible CAD increase her risk of respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her recent surgical procedures.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and possible CAD increase her risk of renal failure, which could be exacerbated by her recent surgical procedures and underlying conditions.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of complete heart block and possible CAD make her susceptible to neurological complications, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, or even brain death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hematoma for potential expansion and bleeding.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac rhythm and potential cardiac ischemia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary embolism risk and consider prophylactic anticoagulation.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider transfusions as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and consider prophylactic antibiotics as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider mechanical ventilation as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological function and consider neurological consults as necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female who underwent a right leg thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation. She is currently being monitored in the ICU for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/52 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a faint heart sound, and her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities show no signs of edema or tenderness.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, and platelet count of 330 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are 16 mg/dL and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Monitoring for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.
2. Active type and screen.
3. Immediate Hct check now and trending for q6h.
4. Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
5. Hold off anticoagulation currently.
6. Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
7. Monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
8. Defer workup for possible CAD to primary [**Hospital1 1896**] team/outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.
9. Continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the [**Hospital1 1896**] team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
10. Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
11. Will continue holding her home lasix for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome due to the small perforation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of PVD and recent thrombectomy.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD) due to the patient's history of hypertension, PVD, and severe PVD.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's history of complete heart block and pacemaker placement.
5. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's age and recent surgery.
6. Infection or sepsis due to the patient's compromised immune system and recent surgery.
7. Renal failure or electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's age, recent surgery, and potential for hypovolemia.
8. Neurological complications such as stroke or seizures due to the patient's age and recent surgery.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat potential complications."

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 13471**] is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU for monitoring of hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome following a thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation. She has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and complete heart block with a pacemaker. She is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which has been reversed with protamine. Her initial hemoglobin (Hct) is stable at 35.

The patient is experiencing right leg ischemia, with a tender hematoma and bruise around the incision site, and cooler right toes compared to the left. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 124/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient has been assessed and planned for:

1. Ischemic right foot: Vascular surgery has been consulted, and the patient will be monitored for compartment syndrome, with daily trend of Hct and calf circumference and peripheral pulses every 2 hours.
2. NSTEMI/Demand Ischemia: The patient will be referred to the primary floor Cardiology team for further workup once her acute situation resolves.
3. PUMP/Hypertension: The patient will continue to receive home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily and will hold her home Lasix for now.
4. RHYTHM: The patient will be monitored on telemetry.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Compartment syndrome: The patient is at risk of developing compartment syndrome due to the small perforation and right leg ischemia.
2. Hematoma expansion: The patient's right leg has a tender hematoma and bruise, which may expand and cause further complications.
3. Cardiovascular events: The patient has a history of complete heart block and PVD, which increases her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PVD and is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism, especially with the pneumoboots prophylaxis in place.
5. Wound infection: The patient's right leg incision site is at risk of developing wound infection due to the small perforation and ischemia.
6. Osteomyelitis: The patient's right leg ischemia may lead to osteomyelitis, especially if the infection spreads to the bone.
7. Amputation: The patient's right leg ischemia may lead to amputation if the condition does not improve with treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram. She is currently monitored in the ICU for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/46 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%. She has a first-degree atrioventricular block and faint heart sounds.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-healing incision on her right femoral area with staples and a large old bruise. Her right leg is covered with a pressure dressing, and her left femoral area has a dressing with slight oozing of red blood. Her pulses are non-palpable in both feet, and her right leg circumference is stable.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 95 K/μL. Her creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, and her glucose is 122 mg/dL. Other laboratory results include a partial thromboplastin time of 23.2 seconds, international normalized ratio of 1.1, calcium of 9.0 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 3.3 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma formation: The patient's history of small perforation during the thrombectomy and RLE angiogram increases the risk of hematoma formation.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient's ischemic right leg and history of thrombectomy and RLE angiogram increase the risk of compartment syndrome.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery increases the risk of DVT.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery increases the risk of PE.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of complete heart block and recent pacemaker placement increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's history of recent surgery and hospitalization increases the risk of infection.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of recent surgery and hospitalization increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block, and a recent ischemic right leg with a small perforation following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no worsening signs of compartment syndrome or hematoma formation. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped slightly, but it is now stable at 30%. She has been experiencing some leg pain, which was managed with oxycodone and has improved.

The patient is receiving various medications, including metoprolol tartrate, aspirin, and plavix. Her anticoagulation has been reversed with protamine, and she is currently not receiving anticoagulation. She is also receiving pain management with oxycodone.

The patient has a high risk of developing potential medical complications, including:

1. Compartment syndrome: The patient's leg is at risk of developing compartment syndrome due to the small perforation and potential bleeding. Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome, such as pain, numbness, and tingling, is crucial.
2. Hematoma formation: The patient's leg is also at risk of developing a hematoma, which could worsen her condition. Monitoring for signs of hematoma formation, such as swelling, bruising, and pain, is essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her PVD and recent surgery. Ambulation and prophylaxis measures are necessary to reduce this risk.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is also at risk of developing PE due to her PVD and recent surgery. Monitoring for signs of PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and tachycardia, is crucial.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection due to her recent surgery and prolonged hospital stay. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, and swelling, is essential.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent ischemic event and complete heart block make her at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Monitoring for signs of cardiac complications is crucial.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, including compartment syndrome, hematoma formation, DVT, PE, infection, and cardiac complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 13471**] is a 85 year-old female with hypertension, PVD, complete
   block s/p pacemaker placement, and an ischemic right leg s/p
   thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation being
   monitored in the CCU for hematoma formation or possible compartment
   syndrome.
   # Ischemic R foot s/p thrombectomy and RLE angiogram with small
   performation:
   Vascular surgery has been consulted.  Her anticoagulation with heparin
   had been reversed with protamine.  Her initial Hct is stable at 35.
   She denies any pain currently.  Hct now stable at 30 but no worsening
   signs on exam, no signs of compartment syndrome.
   - Active type and screen.
   - trend Hct daily and monitor for compartment syndrome
   - Appreciate vascular surgery consult, will f/u recs.
   - Will monitor calf circumference and peripheral pulses q2h.
   - Hold off anticoagulation currently.
   - Continue plavix 75 mg po daily.
   # NSTEMI/Demand Ischemia:
   Patient was reported to have elevated CEs at the OSH, however her CK
   here was normal and her trop was 0.03.  She has no history of chest
   pain, but does have severe PVD which makes the likelihood of CAD high.
   She has had no previous catheterizations in our system.
   - Defer workup for possible CAD to primary floor Cardiology
   team/outpatient setting once her acute situation has resolved.
   - Will continue the B-blocker and ASA which was started here by the
   floor Cardiology team unless she has evidence of bleeding.
   # PUMP/Hypertension:  The patient appears euvolemic.
   - Continue home Amlodipine 5mg PO daily.
   - Will continue holding her home lasix for now.
   # RHYTHM: She had complete heart block s/p pacemaker placement.
   Admission EKG showed V-paced rhythm.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   # Tobacco use:
   - Smoking cessation counseling.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), complete heart block, and an ischemic right leg following thrombectomy and RLE angiogram complicated by a small perforation. She is currently monitored in the ICU for hematoma formation or possible compartment syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 150/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-healing incision with staples in place on the right femoral area, which is tender with a hematoma and bruise. Her right leg circumference is stable, and sensation is intact. Her toes are cooler than the left but slightly warmer than yesterday.

Laboratory results show a slight decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) from 35.7% to 30.7%, but no worsening signs of compartment syndrome. Her platelet count is 307 K/uL, and her creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Active type and screen for blood transfusions.
2. Trending Hct daily and monitoring for compartment syndrome.
3. Appreciating vascular surgery consult and following up with recommendations.
4. Monitoring calf circumference and peripheral pulses every 2 hours.
5. Holding off anticoagulation currently.
6. Continuing Plavix 75 mg orally daily.
7. Defering workup for possible coronary artery disease (CAD) to primary floor Cardiology team/outpatient setting once the acute situation has resolved.
8. Continuing beta-blocker and aspirin unless evidence of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hematoma expansion or compartment syndrome, which could lead to further tissue damage or even amputation.
2. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of PVD and recent surgery.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, given the patient's history of complete heart block and ischemic right leg.
4. Infection or sepsis, which could be exacerbated by the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of foreign bodies (staples and catheters).
5. Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition, which could impact the patient's overall health and recovery.
6. Medication-related adverse effects, such as bleeding or allergic reactions, given the patient's complex medication regimen.

Close monitoring and careful management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent or minimize these potential complications."
