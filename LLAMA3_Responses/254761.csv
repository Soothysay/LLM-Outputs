You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and anaphylaxis. Their vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%. They are receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory support, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs): The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, increasing the risk of CRBSIs.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to their prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids may increase their risk of developing stress ulcers.
5. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's history of anaphylaxis, it is essential to monitor them closely for any signs of an allergic reaction.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation may increase their risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's use of diuretics and their critical illness may increase their risk of developing renal insufficiency.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged intubation and respiratory support may increase their risk of developing respiratory failure.
9. Sepsis: The patient's critical illness and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing sepsis.
10. Multi-organ failure: The patient's critical illness and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is an elderly Caucasian male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. He was given CPR, atropine, and epi, and was intubated. He was also given two units of blood.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and his electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a normal sinus rhythm. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, a pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 25/15 mmHg, and a cardiac index (CI) of 2.5 liters per minute per square meter.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 x 10^9 per liter, a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.3 g/dL, and a platelet count (PLT) of 236 x 10^9 per liter. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 20 mg/dL, and his creatinine (Cr) level is 3.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes a history of aspirin allergy and anaphylaxis. He has also received antibiotics, fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole.

The patient's physical examination shows a pale complexion, and his skin is dry and pale. His neurologic examination is abnormal, with a decreased level of consciousness and a lack of spontaneous movement.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation, and his oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube. His ventilator mode is set to assist/control (A/C) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, a respiratory rate (RR) of 8 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as bacteremia or septic shock.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic complications may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a stroke or a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal complications may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a gastrointestinal bleed or a bowel obstruction.

Based on the patient's progress note, it appears that he is at risk for developing these complications, and it is important to monitor him closely for any signs of deterioration."

   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers, may rule in
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol in peri-MI setting, increase
   statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn
   -- consider change to PSV as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%. Does not appear
   decompensated currently given CXR
   -- given GI bleed, will hold on diuresis (no lasix, aldactone)
   -- care with IVF, blood products
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in
   setting of cardiac arrest.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- send urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - liekly from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including CAD, s/p MI and CABG, who presented with lethargy and black stools, and was found to have a GI bleed. He experienced a cardiac arrest, was resuscitated, and is now in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is:

* Cardiac: Sinus bradycardia, cardiac arrest, elevated troponin-T, and possible demand ischemia.
* Respiratory: Intubated, receiving invasive ventilation, and on 50% FiO2.
* GI: GI bleed, anemia, and possible ischemic ATN.
* Renal: Acute on chronic renal failure, with elevated creatinine and possible prerenal etiology.
* Metabolic: Lactic acidosis, possible from ischemia, and hyperglycemia.
* Hemodynamic: Hypotension, with a blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac:
	+ Myocardial infarction
	+ Cardiogenic shock
	+ Ischemic ATN
* Respiratory:
	+ Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	+ Barotrauma
* GI:
	+ Further bleeding
	+ Ischemic colitis
* Renal:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
* Metabolic:
	+ Hyperglycemic crisis
	+ Lactic acidosis exacerbation
* Hemodynamic:
	+ Hypotension
	+ Hypovolemic shock

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Cardiac: Continue cardiac monitoring, trend biomarkers, and consider echo to evaluate LVEF.
* GI: Continue IV PPI gtt, transfuse to HCT of 30, and hold coumadin.
* Respiratory: Wean O2 as tolerated, consider change to PSV, and monitor ABGs prn.
* Renal: Trend creatinine, send urine lytes, osms, and eo's, and renally dose meds.
* Metabolic: Trend lactate, and consider insulin therapy for hyperglycemia.
* Hemodynamic: Continue volume resuscitation, and monitor blood pressure.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers, may rule in
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol in peri-MI setting, increase
   statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn
   -- consider change to PSV as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%. Does not appear
   decompensated currently given CXR
   -- given GI bleed, will hold on diuresis (no lasix, aldactone)
   -- care with IVF, blood products
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in
   setting of cardiac arrest.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- send urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - liekly from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC will need to be resited
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin, and chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%. He presented with lethargy and black stools, leading to a diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, and epinephrine. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 57 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute (ipm), and his oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial infarction, and elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows changes consistent with ischemia.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac history and ECG changes suggest that the cardiac arrest may have been triggered by demand ischemia due to the GI bleed.
2. GI Bleed: The patient has a GI bleed, which may have contributed to his cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 15 ipm.
4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated LVEF of 35%.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating AKI.
6. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, likely due to ischemia.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, with a last A1c level of 6.1%.
8. History of PE: The patient has a history of PE on coumadin, which was reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the emergency department.
9. Hip Fracture: The patient has a history of hip fracture, with previous hardware survey appearing intact.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac history and ECG changes suggest that he may be at risk for cardiogenic shock.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and elevated lactate levels may increase his risk for ARDS.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and respiratory failure may increase his risk for sepsis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's AKI and history of PE may increase his risk for renal failure.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac history and ECG changes suggest that he may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Cardiac Monitoring: The patient will be monitored for cardiac arrhythmias and signs of cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Support: The patient will continue to receive invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
3. GI Bleed Management: The patient will receive transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of 30 g/L and will continue to receive IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient's anticoagulation therapy will be held due to the GI bleed and potential risk of demand ischemia.
5. Pain Management: The patient will receive pain management as needed, including IV morphine and fentanyl.
6. Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition support, including IV fluids and electrolytes.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers, may rule in
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol in peri-MI setting, increase
   statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn
   -- consider change to PSV as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35%. Does not appear
   decompensated currently given CXR
   -- given GI bleed, will hold on diuresis (no lasix, aldactone)
   -- care with IVF, blood products
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in
   setting of cardiac arrest.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- send urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - liekly from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC will need to be resited
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   -- no sQ heparin given GIB, pboots
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would
   not want life to be prolonged by life support
   .

Based on the patient's 24-hour events and laboratory results, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
	* Cardiogenic shock
	* Ventricular dysfunction with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure with possible need for mechanical ventilation
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with possible need for transfusions
	* Ischemic colitis or bowel perforation
4. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal azotemia or ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation
5. Metabolic complications:
	* Lactic acidosis due to ischemia or cardiac arrest
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus (DM)
6. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia due to bleeding or bone marrow suppression
	* Thrombocytopenia due to platelet dysfunction or bleeding
7. Infectious complications:
	* Sepsis due to GIB or other sources
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
8. Neurological complications:
	* Confusion or altered mental status due to cardiac arrest, hypoxia, or medications
	* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hypoxia or bleeding

Given the patient's extensive cardiac history, including coronary artery disease and cardiac arrest, it is essential to closely monitor his cardiac function and address any potential complications promptly. Additionally, the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and possible ischemic colitis or bowel perforation require close monitoring and potential surgical intervention. The patient's renal function, electrolyte balance, and fluid status should also be closely monitored to prevent and address potential complications."

   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol (held [**1-15**] brady) in peri-MI
   setting, increase statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed: Follow HCT. Will transfuse, recheck after transfusion
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn. Most recent ABG this am during
   rounds c/w hypoventilation on MMV and pt had episodes of apnea
   overnight. Pressure support increased from 10 to 15. Will repeat ABG
   once stabilized on these settings to re eval
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   - Increase pressure support to 15
   -- wean sedation as tolerate
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Currently
   CXR not c/w worsening CHF but pt
s respiratory pattern c/w some CHF and
   is overall 2.5L positive this am so likely fluid overloaded and will
   need buffing of respiratory status prior to extubation.
   --  care with IVF, blood products
   -- Will give lasix 40 IV x 1 to assess response, change in resp status
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol, although held for
   brady)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Stabilized since admission.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- F/U urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE. If HCT stable, will restart
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC. Will DC R fem line after receives blood products
   if can obtain another PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn

   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient presented with lethargy and black stools, and was found to have a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He suffered a cardiac arrest, which was successfully resuscitated, and is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's cardiac condition is complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic renal failure, which may be contributing to his elevated troponin levels. His echocardiogram shows a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, with mild aortic regurgitation (AR) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR).

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 446. His ABG results show a pH of 7.38, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 223 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, with a decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.3 g/dL and a platelet count (Plt) of 36 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 61 mg/dL, and his creatinine (Cr) level is 3.2 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are mildly elevated, with a potassium (K+) level of 4.4 mEq/L and a phosphorus (PO4) level of 5.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol, which may be contributing to his bleeding complications. His allergies include aspirin and anaphylaxis.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of his cardiac and respiratory status, as well as management of his bleeding complications. He will receive transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as needed. His anticoagulation therapy will be held for now, but may be restarted in the future.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complicated by AKI and chronic renal failure, which may be contributing to his elevated troponin levels. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 446. He may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a GI bleed and a cardiac arrest. He may be at risk for further bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic shock or bleeding into his chest or abdomen.
4. Renal complications: The patient's chronic renal failure may be worsening, which could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or uremic syndrome.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's R hand weakness may be a sign of a neurological complication, such as a stroke or a peripheral neuropathy. He may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or coma.

In summary, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, chronic renal failure, and a history of bleeding complications. He is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, and is at risk for further cardiac, respiratory, bleeding, renal, and neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest due to demand ischemic on a background of ischemic heart failure. The patient was resuscitated with CPR, atropine, epi, and intubation. The patient was then started on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and trans-thoracic echo.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 64 bpm
* Blood pressure: 141/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 236 K/uL
* Platelet count: 61 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 3.3 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 20 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Calcium: 83 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 109 mEq/L
* Phosphorus: 140 mEq/L
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 310 IU/L

The patient's plan includes:

1. Cardiac arrest: to try low-dose Lasix and assess response.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: to try [**4-17**] and assess response.
3. GI bleed: to give 2 more units of blood and assess response.
4. ARF: to follow UOP and CR, and renally dose all meds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
3. GI bleeding due to continued bleeding or delayed bleeding.
4. ARF due to inadequate renal function or delayed response to treatment.
5. Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) 0.5 mg/hour
* Fentanyl 35 mcg/hour
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 8 mg/hour
* Dextrose 50% 8:55 AM
* Simvastatin
* Plavix
* Chlorhex

The patient's plan for nutrition is to receive TF this afternoon if not extubatable. The patient's glycemic control is being monitored, and lines are being managed. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being implemented. The patient's communication plan includes speaking with the wife. The patient's status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who suffered a cardiac arrest, GI bleed, and is currently receiving intensive care in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex, and multiple medical complications can arise. Here are some potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Continued cardiac dysfunction, including biventricular dysfunction, may lead to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
	* Volume overload, as noted in the echo, may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction and increase the risk of cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential respiratory muscle weakness.
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections may develop, particularly with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Continued GI bleeding may lead to further blood loss, hypovolemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
	* The patient's GI bleed may be a sign of underlying gastrointestinal pathology, such as a bleeding ulcer or varices, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) may worsen due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition, hypovolemia, and potential nephrotoxic medications.
	* Chronic kidney disease may evolve into end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Pneumonia, sepsis, or other infections may develop, particularly with prolonged mechanical ventilation, catheters, and other invasive lines.
	* The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the underlying medical conditions, increasing the risk of infections.
6. Neurological Complications:
	* The patient's neurological status may worsen due to the underlying cardiac condition, hypoxia, and potential medication side effects.
	* The patient may develop neurological deficits, such as stroke or seizures, particularly if the cardiac arrest was prolonged or if there is underlying cardiac disease.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who has been experiencing respiratory distress. They were intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a rate of 12 and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/51 mmHg. They are receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management agents.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin levels, indicating potential complications such as sepsis, acute kidney injury, and cardiac injury. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with an elevated PT and PTT, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential AKI, which can worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Cardiac Injury: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac injury, which can lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased mortality.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's abnormal coagulation profile suggests the possibility of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and organ failure.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of VAP, which can lead to secondary infections and increased mortality.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged stay in the ICU increase the risk of pressure ulcers, which can lead to skin breakdown and infection.
7. Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CABSI): The patient's multiple central lines and catheters increase the risk of CABSI, which can lead to sepsis and increased mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol (held [**1-15**] brady) in peri-MI
   setting, increase statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed: Follow HCT. Will transfuse, recheck after transfusion
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- continue IV PPI gtt
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn. Most recent ABG this am during
   rounds c/w hypoventilation on MMV and pt had episodes of apnea
   overnight. Pressure support increased from 10 to 15. Will repeat ABG
   once stabilized on these settings to re eval
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   - Increase pressure support to 15
   -- wean sedation as tolerate
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Currently
   CXR not c/w worsening CHF but pt
s respiratory pattern c/w some CHF and
   is overall 2.5L positive this am so likely fluid overloaded and will
   need buffing of respiratory status prior to extubation.
   --  care with IVF, blood products
   -- Will give lasix 40 IV x 1 to assess response, change in resp status
   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol, although held for
   brady)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Stabilized since admission.
   -- volume resuscitation as above
   -- F/U urine lytes, osms, eo's
   -- renally dose meds
   -- trend Cr
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE. If HCT stable, will restart
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives execpt BB
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV, R femoral TLC. Will DC R fem line after receives blood products
   if can obtain another PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would
   not want life to be prolonged by life support
   .
   # Dispo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo to eval LVEF-> depressed
   -- defib pads in place
   -- trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and low-dose carvedilol (held [**1-15**] brady) in peri-MI
   setting, increase statin to 80mg
   -- hold coumadin for now, would prefer not to anticoagulate given GI
   bleeding leading to demand ischemia.
   -- no ASA given allergy
   .
   # GI bleed: Follow HCT. Will transfuse, recheck after transfusion
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs

   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
   -- wean O2 as tolerated, check ABGs prn. Most recent ABG this am during
   rounds c/w hypoventilation on MMV and pt had episodes of apnea
   overnight. Pressure support increased from 10 to 15. Will repeat ABG
   once stabilized on these settings to re eval
   -- fentanyl/versed gtts to sedation
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- no e/o PTX on CXR following code
   - Increase pressure support to 15
   -- wean sedation as tolerate
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Currently
   CXR not c/w worsening CHF but pt
s respiratory pattern c/w some CHF and
   is overall 2.5L positive this am so likely fluid overloaded and will
   need buffing of respiratory status prior to extubation.
   --  care with IVF, blood products

   -- continue BB with afterload reduction (carvedilol, although held for
   brady)
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Stabilized since admission.
   -- volume resuscitation as above

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to demand ischemia, potentially triggered by GI bleeding.
	* Cardiac arrest, which may lead to further complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
	* Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may indicate a high risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure, including hypoventilation and apnea, which may require increased pressure support and close monitoring.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis is necessary due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
	* The patient's respiratory pattern suggests fluid overload, which may require diuresis and careful management of IV fluids.
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* GI bleeding, which may lead to further bleeding, anemia, or hypovolemic shock.
	* The patient's GI bleed may be due to demand ischemia, which may worsen cardiac function.
4. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ischemia, which may require close monitoring of renal function and volume resuscitation.
	* The patient's chronic renal failure may be exacerbated by the cardiac arrest and GI bleeding.
5. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's R hand weakness may be due to focal neurological findings, which may require further evaluation and imaging.
	* The patient's sedation and respiratory status may impact their neurological function.
6. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia due to GI bleeding, which may require transfusion support.
	* The patient's coagulopathy may be due to Coumadin therapy, which may need to be adjusted or held due to the GI bleed.
7. Infection complications:
	* VAP prophylaxis is necessary due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
	* The patient's chronic renal failure may increase their risk of infection.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications due to their complex medical history, current conditions, and therapies. Close monitoring and careful management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam, though Cr increased.
   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE.
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would
   not want life to be prolonged by life support, will reassess after
   extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam, though Cr increased.
   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 90+ year old male, is admitted to the ICU with a history of extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents with lethargy, black stools, and a GI bleed, which led to cardiac arrest. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 50 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He is sedated and responsive to voice.

The patient has received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 2 large bore IVs. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1,148 mL, with an output of 2,505 mL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slight increase in creatinine.

The patient's cardiac status is of concern, with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% compared to his previous echocardiogram. His troponin-T levels are elevated, and his CK/CKMB levels are normal. His electrocardiogram (EKG) shows changes consistent with ischemia, likely due to demand from GI bleeding.

The patient's GI bleed is being managed with transfusions and close monitoring. His respiratory status is stable, with a pressure support of 15/5 cmH2O and a SpO2 of 99%. He is being weaned off the ventilator and is expected to be extubated in the afternoon.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated lactic acid level, likely due to ischemia from cardiac arrest. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, possibly due to prerenal azotemia. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slight increase in potassium.

The patient's medication regimen includes fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and lasix. His allergies include aspirin and anaphylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history, decreased LVEF, and elevated troponin-T levels increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk of developing respiratory failure, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. GI complications: The patient's GI bleed is being managed, but he is at risk of developing GI complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and prerenal azotemia increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
5. Neurological complications: The patient's decreased level of consciousness and focal neuro findings increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and cerebral edema.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase his risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's GI bleed and anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of developing bleeding complications, such as hematemesis, melena, and epistaxis."

   Gi aware holding off on scope unless fulminant bleeding
   4.            ARF:slight bump with diuresis- will run even and trend ,
   renally dose all meds
   5.            Remianing issues as per housstaff notes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 90-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with a gastrointestinal bleed and cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 164/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He has a mild left lower quadrant tenderness and no edema.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 243 K/uL, and creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.94 ng/mL and a CK-MB level of 111 IU/L.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiac arrest, hypoxemic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, and ischemic heart failure. He is receiving treatment for these conditions, including diuresis, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and ischemic heart failure put him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac rupture.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation increase his risk for respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed and continued bleeding risk increase his risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure and continued risk for further kidney damage increase his risk for renal complications, such as dialysis, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and invasive lines and tubes increase his risk for infection, including sepsis, bacteremia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypoxemic respiratory failure increase his risk for neurological complications, such as brain injury, stroke, and seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with a GI bleed and cardiac arrest. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Their hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 164/68 mmHg and a heart rate of 71 beats per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 98%, and they are receiving 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). They have a mild left lower quadrant (LLQ) tenderness and no evidence of edema. Their lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 243 K/uL. They have a troponin-T level of 0.94 ng/mL, indicating myocardial injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to demand ischemia on a background of ischemic heart failure. They are currently receiving treatment with Plavix, a statin, and esmolol drip, and will be restarted on a beta blocker if they tolerate extubation.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to their underlying cardiac disease and respiratory failure. Aggressive diuresis and non-invasive ventilation may be necessary to manage their respiratory status.
3. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed is stable, but they are at risk for further bleeding due to their underlying coagulopathy and cardiac disease. They are receiving IV PPI and will be monitored closely for signs of bleeding.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to their underlying cardiac disease and hypotension. They will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function, and their medications will be adjusted accordingly.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to their underlying cardiac disease and respiratory failure. They will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection and sepsis.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to their prolonged intubation and respiratory failure. They will need to be closely monitored for signs of pneumonia, and prophylactic antibiotics will be considered.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to their prolonged immobility and cardiac disease. They will need to be closely monitored for signs of DVT, and prophylactic anticoagulation will be considered.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam and Cr stable.
   n        will attempt to keep fluid balance even today and will restart
   home lasix
   n        restart home lasix
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Creatinine trending down now. Acute renal failure likely prerenal in
   etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in setting of
   cardiac arrest.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even
   -- restart home lasix
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improved
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain on exam. Lactate trending
   down. He has not had BM since admission, likely [**1-15**] constipation.
   Started bowel regimen yesterday. Will continue and consider imaging if
   pain worsens or persists  despite BM. Changed bowel regimen from prn to
   standing
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   n        fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   n        would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider restart soon given recent h/o
   PE.
   n        Will d/w GI
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam and Cr stable.
   n        will attempt to keep fluid balance even today and will restart
   home lasix
   n        restart home lasix
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Creatinine trending down now. Acute renal failure likely prerenal in
   etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in setting of
   cardiac arrest.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even
   -- restart home lasix
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improved
   .
   #Abdominal pain: Pt has mild abdominal pain on exam. Lactate trending
   down. He has not had BM since admission, likely [**1-15**] constipation.
   Started bowel regimen yesterday. Will continue and consider imaging if
   pain worsens or persists  despite BM. Changed bowel regimen from prn to
   standing
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   n        fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   n        would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider restart soon given recent h/o
   PE.
   n        Will d/w GI

   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look

   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam, though Cr increased.
   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE.
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV
   -- R radial arterial line

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90+ year old male with extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He has also had a pulmonary embolism and is on coumadin.

The patient was intubated and sedated, but was successfully extubated. He reported chest pain and was found to have anaphylaxis to aspirin. He was given meperidine and tylenol, and ASA was held.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 148/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He has a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin T levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction. His cardiac enzymes are also elevated, and his lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L, indicating possible ischemia.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 20%. He has also had a gastrointestinal bleed and is at risk for further bleeding due to his cardiac status and use of anticoagulant medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Myocardial infarction: Given the patient's history of cardiac disease and elevated troponin T levels, there is a risk of further myocardial infarction.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already had a gastrointestinal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to his cardiac status and use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to his chronic heart failure and potential pulmonary embolism.
4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in his renal function due to his cardiac status and use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to his prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hip fracture and is at risk of developing neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
7. Anaphylaxis: The patient had an anaphylactic reaction to aspirin, and there is a risk of further anaphylaxis due to his allergy.

In summary, the patient is at risk of developing a range of medical complications due to his extensive cardiac disease, gastrointestinal bleed, and use of anticoagulant medications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent or minimize these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to demand from GI bleeding. Trop-T was elevated in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index was positive,
   again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have triggered
   myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest. Less likely
   to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- no signs of cardiogenic shock
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed  decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO to eval if improved.
   -- Consult cardiology for recs
   -- will continue to trend biomarkers
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy, will re-assess when pt
   extubated.
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will start esmolol drip to
   reduce BP prior to extubation.
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5uints pRBCs.
   -- GI aware, will follow
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt, to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt satting well on pressure support of 15/5
   overnight, reduced to [**11-17**] and then [**7-18**] during morning. Breathing
   well.  Sedation off in the AM.
   -- VAP ppx, HOB elevation
   -- continue to wean off vent during morning
   -- SBTs in afternoon, repeat ABG and lactate
   -- Extubate in PM if improving
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   -1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam, though Cr increased.
   --  will attempt to keep fluid balance even today.
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Likely prerenal in etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN
   in setting of cardiac arrest. Increased slightly overnight, possibly
   from diuresis, but CHF w/ EF of 20% more pressing concern.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even today
   -- if worsens consider renal consult for recs
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis - likely from ischemia [**1-15**] cardiac arrest, improving
   -- trend lactate, improving with volume resuscitation
   .
   # DM - last A1c was 6.1%
   -- fixed and SSI, FSG qid
   .
   # h/o PE: INR was therapeutic in the ED, but pt was reversed with FFP
   in setting of GI bleed.
   -- would hold anticoagulation given GIB possibly causing demand
   ischemia, MI for now but will consider retart tomorrow given recent h/o
   PE.
   .
   # s/p Hip fracture:
   -- previous hardware survey appears intact
   -- pain control
   .
   # ? R hand weakness: Will follow. Upon later exam, pt more awake with
   equal strength. Consider imaging if focal neuro findings.
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold antihypertensives
   -- esmolol drip as above
   .
   # Access
   -- PIV
   -- R radial arterial line
   .
   # FEN
   -- npo for now. Will start TF if will not extubate today
   -- replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx
   -- IV PPI gtt
   - SC heparin
   -- no bowel regimen needed given GIB
   .
   # Code - Full code confirmed with family, but if pt deteriorates would
   not want life to be prolonged by life support, will reassess after
   extubation.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to demand ischemia from GI bleeding
	* Cardiogenic shock due to decreased LVEF
	* Ischemic ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis) due to cardiac arrest and potential prerenal azotemia
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Respiratory failure due to continued need for mechanical ventilation
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal azotemia and potential ischemic ATN
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression due to continued cardiac disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* GI bleeding due to ongoing ischemia and potential re-bleeding
	* Small bowel obstruction or bowel perforation due to previous surgery and potential adhesions
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Focal neurological findings due to potential ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
	* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to potential cerebral edema
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia due to ongoing blood loss and potential bone marrow suppression
	* Coagulopathy due to potential bleeding disorder and anticoagulation therapy
7. Infection-related Complications:
	* Sepsis due to potential bacterial or fungal infections
	* Meningitis or encephalitis due to potential central nervous system infections

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest a high risk of these complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or minimize their occurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture

   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including CAD, s/p MI and CABG, who presented with lethargy and black stools, found to have a GI bleed, and subsequently had a cardiac arrest. He was extubated successfully and is currently being managed in the ICU. His current condition is stable, but he has several ongoing medical issues, including chronic systolic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's extensive cardiac disease and recent cardiac arrest, there is a high risk of cardiac complications, including recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to the recent GI bleed and cardiac arrest, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the potential for aspiration pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's GI bleed may lead to further bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, and his abdominal pain may worsen or become a sign of a more serious condition, such as pancreatitis or small bowel obstruction.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's recent cardiac arrest may have led to neurological damage, including cerebral edema, stroke, or seizures, which could worsen his cognitive function and overall condition.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent GI bleed may increase his risk of infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
7. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anaphylactic allergy to aspirin and his recent GI bleed may lead to further bleeding complications, including bleeding from the GI tract, lungs, or other sites.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour post-extubation, who experienced chest pain at 11:00 PM and was given MS 1.0 mg and 2 tylenol. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to aspirin and is currently on PO diet, which was tolerated well.

Physiological parameters:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 70 bpm, BP 148/81 mmHg, RR 20 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 12 mmHg, MAP 85 mmHg, CO 4.2 L/min, SVR 1,400 dyne·s/cm⁵.
* Fluid balance: Total In 838 mL, Total Out 1,815 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -977 mL.
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device nasal cannula, Ventilator mode PSV/SBT, FiO2 50%.

Laboratory results:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 9.5 K/uL, Hct 31.5%, Plt 243 K/uL.
* Biochemistry: Na 143 mEq/L, K 4.2 mEq/L, Cl 109 mEq/L, CO2 21 mmHg, Glucose 68 mg/dL.
* Coagulation profile: PT 15.2 seconds, PTT 31.2 seconds, INR 1.3.
* Troponin-T 1.02 ng/mL.
* Other labs: CK 81 IU/L, CKMB 9 IU/L, TCO2 22 mmHg, Lactic acid 1.2 mmol/L, Albumin 3.3 g/dL, LDH 287 IU/L, Ca++ 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 5.7 mg/dL.

The patient's condition is stable, with no significant changes noted in the past 24 hours. However, the following potential medical complications should be monitored closely:

1. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain could be a sign of cardiac or pulmonary complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia.
2. Anaphylaxis: The patient's history of anaphylaxis to aspirin and the current use of MS 1.0 mg may indicate a risk of anaphylaxis to other medications.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's negative fluid balance may indicate a risk of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Respiratory support: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy may indicate a risk of respiratory failure or complications.
5. Coagulation profile: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may indicate a risk of bleeding or coagulopathy.
6. Troponin-T elevation: The patient's elevated Troponin-T level may indicate a risk of cardiac injury or infarction.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any potential medical complications. Further evaluation and management should focus on addressing the patient's chest pain, fluid imbalance, respiratory support, coagulation profile, and troponin-T elevation."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam and Cr stable.
   n        will attempt to keep fluid balance even today and will restart
   home lasix
   n        restart home lasix
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Creatinine trending down now. Acute renal failure likely prerenal in
   etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in setting of
   cardiac arrest.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with extensive cardiac disease including CAD s/p
   MI and CABG, PE on coumadin, who presents with lethargy and black
   stools, found to have a GI bleed, who is now s/p cardiac arrest.
   .
   # CAD s/p Cardiac Arrest: Extensive previous cardiac history s/p CABG.
   His EKG on this admission demonstrated changes c/w ischemia, most
   likely due to increased demand from anemia and GI bleeding. Trop-T was
   elevated in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, but MB-index
   was positive, again likely due to demand ischemia. This could have
   triggered myocardial infarction and potentially his cardiac arrest.
   Less likely to be ACS/unstable plaque rupture
   -- echo immediately after arrest showed decreased LVEF to 20%, from
   30-35%. Will re-ECHO in approximately 1 week to reassess
   -- cardiac monitoring
   -- continue plavix and statin at 80mg
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now, given risk of GI bleeding and
   recurrent demand ischemia but will d/w GI when can restart given recent
   PE.
   -- ASA held given reported anaphylactic allergy which was confirmed by
   pt
   -- hypertensive today, but not tachycardic, will continue carvedilol,
   add home lasix, consider adding aldactone if real function remains
   stable/improved
   .
   # GI bleed: HCT stable after transfusions, totaling 5units pRBCs. No
   further transfusions needed at this time. HCT stable>30
   -- GI aware
   -- transfuse to HCT of 30 given CAD, recent cardiac arrest
   -  HCT trending up
   -- 2 large bore IVs
   -- change  IV PPI gtt to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- hold coumadin as above, will d/w GI
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: pt extubated, doing well
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF of 35% now 20%. Diuresed
   1.5 L yesterday in response to lasix 40mg IV x1. CXR continues to look
   good and no evidence of CHF on exam and Cr stable.
   n        will attempt to keep fluid balance even today and will restart
   home lasix
   n        restart home lasix
   .
   # A on chronic RF - Baseline Cr has been 2.2-2.5 in early [**Month (only) **].
   Creatinine trending down now. Acute renal failure likely prerenal in
   etiology given recent GIB. Concern for ischemic ATN in setting of
   cardiac arrest.
   -- will continue to trend Cr.
   -- keep fluid balance even
   -- restart home lasix

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with extensive cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with lethargy and black stools, was found to have a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and subsequently had a cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Extubated, doing well, with a SpO2 of 94% on nasal cannula oxygen.
* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% from 30-35%. The patient is on cardiotonic medications, including carvedilol, and is being monitored for cardiac rhythm.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient had a GI bleed, which was managed with transfusions and is currently stable.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal causes, and is being monitored for creatinine levels.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 g/dL.
* Neurological: The patient is awake and alert, with equal strength in both upper and lower extremities.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and decreased LVEF increase the risk of further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and extubation may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's GI bleed and history of GI bleeding may increase the risk of further GI bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, and the patient may require dialysis.
* Infectious complications: The patient's history of PE and current condition may increase the risk of further infectious complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and wound infections.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue cardiac monitoring and cardiotonic medications.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's GI bleed and monitor for signs of further bleeding.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management and diuretic therapy as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's hematological status and transfuse as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medication as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's infectious status and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
* Consider imaging studies to evaluate the patient's cardiac and respiratory status.

The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, and the physician will reassess the patient's condition and plan of care as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed arrest. The patient had a cardiac arrest on the previous day, which was likely due to demand ischemic on a background of ischemic heart failure. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and he is receiving medications such as Plavix, Statin, Carvedilol, and Imdur. The patient is also on room air after being extubated.

The patient's GI bleed is stable, with a hematocrit of 29.1 after receiving 5 units of blood over the past 48 hours. The patient has good access and is receiving IV PPI. The GI team is holding off on performing a scope unless the bleeding becomes fulminant.

The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) has improved, and he is being managed with home Lasix. The patient's urine output and creatinine are being trended to monitor renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and ischemic heart failure make him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac tamponade.
2. GI complications: The patient's GI bleed may continue to bleed or worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, or other complications.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to further decline in renal function, electrolyte imbalances, or the need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise or the need for reintubation.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or other bleeding events.
6. Infection complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and invasive lines and devices make him at risk for infection, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or line-related infections.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypoxic respiratory failure may have caused neurological damage, leading to cognitive impairment, seizures, or other neurological complications.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate them."

   Assessment and Plan
   1.  Cardiac Arrest: likely due to demand ischemic on a background of
   ischemic heart failure. Peri arrest echo shows bivent dysfunction
likely better now- hemodynamics stable. Plavix, Statin. Carvedilol and
   Imdur. Appreciate Cardiology consultation.
   2.  Hypoxemic Resp Failure: resolves s/p extubation now on room air
   3.  GI bleed: stable HCT 29.1 after 5 units (last 48 hrs ago) good
   access, IV PPI, GI aware holding off on scope unless fulminant bleeding
   4.  ARF: improved, keep on home Lasix, trend UOP and CR renally dose
   all meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of GI bleed arrest. The patient has been stabilized after a cardiac arrest, and hemodynamics are stable. The patient is on invasive ventilation, but has been extubated and is now on room air. The patient has a history of ischemic heart failure, and an echocardiogram showed biventricular dysfunction. The patient's GI bleed is stable, and the plan is to hold off on endoscopy unless bleeding is fulminant.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of ischemic heart failure and the recent cardiac arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's GI bleed is stable, but there is still a risk of further bleeding or perforation.
4. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
5. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections, given the invasive lines and devices in place.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but there is still a risk of instability, particularly if the patient's cardiac function deteriorates.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and there is a risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."
