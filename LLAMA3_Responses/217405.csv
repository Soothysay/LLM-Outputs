   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ a h/o CKD presents with ACS in setting of severe anemia
   likely secondary to UGI bleed.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI given lack of ST elevations on EKG, did have pain
   and positive troponins.  He is high risk and ideally would undergo
   maximal medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization however he
   has a high risk given large GI bleed.  In addition his symptoms began
   48 hours ago and are likely secondary to his bleed rather than plaque
   rupture.  Given bleed will need to medically manage.
   -high dose statin
   -low dose beta blocker, up titrate as tolerated
   -transfuse for hct < 30
   -start ACEi eventually when Cr stabilized and out of acute setting
   -aspirin 325mg daily
   -EKG in a.m.
   .
   # PUMP: obtain echo to evaluate EF as well as for valvular disease or
   possible complications of missed infarction.  The patient is in acute
   heart failure with signs of both L and R heart failure.  Lasix drip
   with goal diuresis 1 liter negative today.
   -continue BiPAP, with blood transfusions may need intubation if
   oxygenation worsens
   -BP currently normal, hold antihypertensives for now and start as
   needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, monitor on tele
   .
   # GI bleed: Melena with a hct drop.  Likely bleeding source, given ACS
   will have to transfuse to goal HCT of 30.
   -maintain active type and screen
   -GI consult- f/u recs
   -protonix drip at 8mg / hr
   -2 large bore IVs (has 4 PIV now)
   -other causes for anemia would be chronic or possibly hemolysis
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   -? cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any further characterization,
   since then has cut down his drinking.  will send albumin.  No other
   stigmata of liver disease.  Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Given GI bleed and MI / CHF likely a
   result of pre-renal causes. (bleed vs. poor forward flow from CHF)
   FENA 23.9
   -send u/a and urine lytes
   -if not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   -baseline cr from 1 year ago was 1.6
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap is 18.  Given CHF and bleed this is
   possibly due to a lactic acidosis.
   -send lactate and trend
   -glucose is 242, patient is possibly a diabetic but given this degree
   of hyperglycemia his gap is unlikely related to DKA.  F/u U/a
   -another possibility would be uremia although lactic acidosis is still
   more likely.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: possibly related to acute renal failure.
   -send p.m. hct, likely will come down with lasix drip
   -recheck p.m. potassium
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: likely as a result of acute MI however will need to
   rule out other causes.
   -f/u final read on CXR
   -send urine culture, u/a.  Blood cultures, f/u final read of CXR
   -re-culture if [**Last Name (LF) 2180**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on antibiotics for now but did
   recieve broad spectrum abx upon initial presentation.
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   -qid finger stick glucose
   -hold oral hypoglycemics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of severe anemia likely secondary to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. He has a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is at high risk for cardiac complications. The patient has signs of both left and right heart failure, with acute heart failure symptoms, and is being managed with diuretics and blood transfusions.

The patient has a significant anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.6 g/dL, and is being transfused to a goal Hb level of 30. He has a history of cirrhosis, but it is unclear if it is still active, and is being evaluated for possible causes of anemia, including chronic or hemolytic anemia.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 23.9, and is being evaluated for possible causes, including pre-renal causes, such as bleeding or poor forward flow from heart failure.

The patient has an anion gap acidosis, possibly due to lactic acidosis, and is being evaluated for possible causes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and uremia.

The patient has hyperkalemia, possibly related to acute renal failure, and is being monitored for possible causes and treatment.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to acute MI, and is being evaluated for possible causes, including infection.

The patient has a history of diabetes and is being managed with insulin and sliding scale insulin, with a goal blood glucose (BG) level of <150 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, due to the patient's NSTEMI and heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure, due to the patient's respiratory support and possible aspiration of gastric contents.
3. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease progression, and electrolyte imbalances, due to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure and possible pre-renal causes.
4. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and sepsis, due to the patient's UGI bleed and possible gastrointestinal obstruction.
5. Infection complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs), due to the patient's immunocompromised state and possible invasive procedures.
6. Hyperglycemic complications, such as DKA, due to the patient's diabetes and possible insulin resistance.
7. Acid-base imbalance complications, such as metabolic acidosis, due to the patient's anion gap acidosis and possible lactic acidosis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance complications, such as hyperkalemia, due to the patient's acute renal failure and possible electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ a h/o CKD presents with ACS in setting of severe anemia
   likely secondary to UGI bleed.
   .
   # CORONARIES: NSTEMI given lack of ST elevations on EKG, did have pain
   and positive troponins. He is high risk and ideally would undergo
   maximal medical therapy and undergo cardiac catheterization however he
   has a high risk given large GI bleed. In addition his symptoms began 48
   hours ago and are likely secondary to his bleed rather than plaque
   rupture. Given bleed will need to medically manage.
   -high dose statin
   -low dose beta blocker, up titrate as tolerated
   -transfuse for hct < 30
   -start ACEi eventually when Cr stabilized and out of acute setting
   -aspirin 325mg daily
   -EKG in a.m.
   .
   # PUMP: obtain echo to evaluate EF as well as for valvular disease or
   possible complications of missed infarction. The patient is in acute
   heart failure with signs of both L and R heart failure. Lasix drip with
   goal diuresis 1 liter negative today.
   -continue BiPAP, with blood transfusions may need intubation if
   oxygenation worsens
   -BP currently normal, hold antihypertensives for now and start as
   needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, monitor on tele
   .
   # GI bleed: Melena with a hct drop, however Hct stable overnight.
   Likely bleeding source, given ACS will have to transfuse to goal HCT of
   30.
   -maintain active type and screen
   -GI consult- f/u recs
   -protonix drip at 8mg / hr
   -2 large bore IVs (has 4 PIV now)
   -other causes for anemia would be chronic or possibly hemolysis
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future

   stigmata of liver disease. Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely

   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Given GI bleed and MI / CHF likely a
   result of pre-renal causes. (bleed vs. poor forward flow from CHF)
   -send u/a and urine lytes
   -if not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   -baseline cr from 1 year ago was 1.6
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap improved to 14 from 18. Lactate mostly
   normal, but may have been more elevated at time of gap. Elevated BUN
   may suggest a small component of uremia. Glucose was 242, but given
   this degree of hyperglycemia his gap is unlikely related to DKA. No
   ketones on UA
   - Continue to trend lytes

   # HYPERKALEMIA: possibly related to acute renal failure.
   -send p.m. hct, likely will come down with lasix drip
   -recheck p.m. potassium

   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Afebrile with downtrending WBC. Elevated WBC likely as
   a result of acute MI however will need to rule out other causes.
   -f/u final read on CXR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of severe anemia, likely secondary to upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. He has a large GI bleed and is at high risk for further bleeding. The patient has been started on high-dose statin, low-dose beta blocker, and aspirin, and is being transfused for anemia. He is also receiving diuretics for heart failure and has a goal diuresis of 1 liter negative today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's large GI bleed is a significant risk factor for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's ACS and heart failure increase his risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increase his risk for further renal complications, including worsening kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely secondary to UGI bleed, increases his risk for further anemia, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, cardiovascular instability, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient's UGI bleed and ACS increase his risk for infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and potential need for intubation increase his risk for respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's UGI bleed and potential need for endoscopy increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, including perforation, bleeding, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and anion gap acidosis increase his risk for metabolic complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and potentially life-threatening complications.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   likely atrial tachycardia with intermittent conduction.  Received
   lopressor and dilt IV and then increased PO doses of both meds.
   Returned to NSR around midnight.  Had some leg pain, LENIs ordered.
   CXR showed no new consolidation.  PM labs repleated.  Daughter raised
   possibility of transferring back to be closer to family but agreed that
   it might be safer to keep him here.
   This morning he complains of leg pain but no chest pain, dyspnea, or
   pain anywhere else

   IU/L, Ca++:10.1 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.7 mg/dL
   BCX NGTD;  Chest PA/Lat: stable pulm edema, no consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 9L
   negative for LOS.  Cr is mildly elevated today but still seems to have
   fluid overload, as he stil has an O2 requirement.  ECHO showed no WMA
   or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.  Tachycardia has
   generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with decreased lasix drip rate (2.5 mg/hr)
   with a goal of -500 cc.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, DVT, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.  CXR with no evidence of new infiltrate.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes
   .
   # LEG PAIN:  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to compression from pneuomboots.  No
   swelling, but must r/o DVT.  Also possibly related to gout in setting
   of diuresis, but no evidence of joint symptoms on exam.
   - vascular ultrasound today
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 25 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PPI given GI bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Called out but then called back in.  Overnight developed irregular SVT,
   likely atrial tachycardia with intermittent conduction.  Received
   lopressor and dilt IV and then increased PO doses of both meds.
   Returned to NSR around midnight.  Had some leg pain, LENIs ordered.
   CXR showed no new consolidation.  PM labs repleated.  Daughter raised
   possibility of transferring back to be closer to family but agreed that
   it might be safer to keep him here.
   This morning he complains of leg pain but no chest pain, dyspnea, or
   pain anywhere else
   Allergies:
   No Known Drug Allergies

   # LEG PAIN:  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to compression from pneuomboots.  No
   swelling, but must r/o DVT.  Also possibly related to gout in setting
   of diuresis, but no evidence of joint symptoms on exam.
   - vascular ultrasound today
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 25 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF, with symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and leg pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/47 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on 3L desaturation with coughing.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, and mild elevation in creatinine. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild elevation in potassium.

The patient's physical examination reveals a non-displaced pulse at the apex of the heart, a 3-cm palpable liver edge, and bilateral pedal edema. The patient's lungs are clear, and the abdomen is moderately distended.

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, which was diagnosed 30 years ago. The patient has a history of smoking and has cut down on his drinking.

The patient's medications include furosemide, metoprolol, diltiazem, aspirin, statin, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that can arise are:

1. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF, which can lead to further decompensation and worsening of symptoms.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count can be a result of acute MI, DVT, or infection.
3. Leg pain: The patient's leg pain can be secondary to compression from pneuomoboots, DVT, or gout.
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient's presentation is consistent with NSTEMI, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is mildly elevated, which can be a result of prerenal causes, ATN, or postrenal causes.
6. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap was elevated on admission, which can be a result of lactate or ketones, and modestly elevated BUN.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was mildly elevated, which can be a result of diuresis.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, which can lead to further complications.

Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the plan is to continue diuresis with decreased lasix drip rate, continue to wean oxygen as tolerated, and follow cultures for leukocytosis. The patient will also undergo vascular ultrasound for leg pain and stress testing for NSTEMI. The patient's medications will be adjusted as necessary to manage his symptoms and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 8L
   negative for LOS.  He has not had elevations in Cr or hypotension.
   ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation.
   Tachycardia has generally resolved.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip with a goal of 1-2L
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - Will check PA and lateral today to eval for brewing PNA that may have
   been masked by volume
   - Consider CT if worsening.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today.
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Has was tachycardic since coming off BiPAP.
   Originally this was refractory to increasing doses of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID, that was done to allow for diastolic filling
   time.   His tachycardia has since improved with improving respiratory
   status, suggesting tachycardia was secondary to resp discomfort.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Given ACS transfuse to goal HCT
   of 30 with symptoms.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any
   further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix PO BID
   - having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS: pneumoboots, PPI given GI bleed

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient presented with chest pain, acute kidney injury (AKI), and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a peak of 15.2 K/uL
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 256 IU/L
* Elevated troponin-T at 1.41 ng/mL
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) at 334 IU/L
* Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 29 IU/L
* Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 20 IU/L
* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALK) at 61 IU/L
* Elevated total bilirubin (T Bili) at 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Echocardiogram (ECHO) showing impaired relaxation and no wall motion abnormality (WMA) or valvular disease
* Chest X-ray (CXR) showing no new consolidation

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

* Diastolic congestive heart failure (DCHF): The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF, and he is being managed with diuresis and oxygen therapy.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI or a slowly brewing infection. The patient is being monitored for signs of infection and has had negative urine and blood cultures.
* Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has had positive troponins and is being managed with medical therapy, including aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.
* Sinus tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has improved with improving respiratory status, suggesting that it was secondary to respiratory discomfort.
* GI bleed: The patient has had a history of cirrhosis and has been transfused for anemia. He is being managed with proton pump inhibitors and is scheduled for an endoscopy.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has had a peak creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL and is being managed with diuresis and close monitoring of renal function.
* Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap is elevated at 16, and he is being monitored for signs of ketoacidosis or uremia.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has resolved with diuresis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and history of NSTEMI make him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for respiratory failure due to his CHF and NSTEMI.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and negative cultures make him at risk for infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's AKI and history of CKD make him at risk for renal failure.
* GI bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and GI bleed make him at risk for further GI bleeding.
* Cardiovascular events: The patient's history of NSTEMI and CHF make him at risk for further cardiovascular events."
