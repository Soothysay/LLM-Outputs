   Assessment and Plan
   69F with DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis presents
   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  CXR clear, no localizing
   pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonia.  PE unlikely given acuity,
   degree of fever and lack of hypoxia.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff although leukocytosis lower
   than previously and no diarrhea.  Also had treatment for diverticulitis
   2 months ago with associated microperforation, although non-tender on
   abd exam with no recent abd pain or change in stool.  Did have
   relatively recent knee tap, but without evidence for prior or ongoing
   infection in the joint.
   -blood cultures
   -urine cultures
   -Empiric antibiotics with vanc (given recent procedure), cipro/ctx for
   double GNR coverage for potential GU source
   -Tylenol PRN fevers
   -c. diff toxin
   -r/o flu
   -Low threshold for CT abd to eval for abscess if continues to spike.
   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach.  Pt most likely dry based on subjective
   thirst, procedurization, febrility and prolonged NPO status prior to
   procedure.
   -PO and IV hydration overnight
   -Check TSH
   -1gram tylenol prn fever
   -tx likely infection as above.
   # ARF: Creatinine has ranged 1.0-2.0 in past 3 months, baseline likely
   1-1.3.  Had ARF in setting of diverticulitis which fully resolved, had
   cr of 2.0 as outpatient for unclear reasons, was 1.6 prior to procedure
   and 1.9 currently.  Urine lytes with FeNa 2%, in setting of pt being on
   HCTZ yesterday and after hydration, so is less informative. Elevation
   likely pre-renal despite this.
   -Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely
   -Agressive IVF/PO hydration
   -Tx infection as above
   -consider repeat GU imaging if persists to ensure no new obstruction in
   setting of instrumentation, although unlikely given stent in place.
   # Nephrolithiasis: s/p lithotripsy/ureteral stent replacement
   -f/u urology recs
   -foley in place
   # HTN:
   -continue atenolol, hold HCTZ/ACEI as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis, who presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. She was empirically started on antibiotics, including Vanc, Cipro, and Ceftiaxone. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg. She is tachycardic, but without signs of hypoxia. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for a soft and non-tender abdomen.

The patient has a high fever with rigors, concerning for bacterial infection or bacteremia, likely originating from the urine. She has a history of recent antibiotic treatment, raising concern for C. diff. The patient is also at risk for ARF due to her pre-existing kidney disease and recent instrumentation. She is being treated with aggressive IVF and PO hydration, and her creatinine level is currently 1.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bacterial infection or bacteremia: The patient's high fever with rigors and tachycardia suggest a bacterial infection, likely originating from the urine. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's history of recent antibiotic treatment and lack of diarrhea suggest a possible C. diff infection. If left untreated, this could lead to severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's pre-existing kidney disease and recent instrumentation put her at risk for ARF. If left untreated, this could lead to chronic kidney disease, dialysis dependence, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
4. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of nephrolithiasis and recent lithotripsy/ureteral stent replacement put her at risk for further stone formation and obstruction. If left untreated, this could lead to recurrent kidney stones, chronic kidney disease, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of DM2 and recent instrumentation put her at risk for hyperglycemia. If left untreated, this could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, and potentially life-threatening complications."

   with fevers, rigors and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral
   stent placement.
   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff and now with elevated WBC
   count there is a high concern for C. diff even without diarrhea.  Also
   had treatment for diverticulitis 2 months ago with associated
   microperforation, although non-tender on abd exam with no recent abd
   pain or change in stool.  Did have relatively recent knee tap, but
   without evidence for prior or ongoing infection in the joint.
   -F/u Blood and urine Cx.

   -r/o flu
   -t/c CT ab to look for evidence of colitis or diverticulitis.

   procedure.
   -PO and IV hydration overnight
   -Check TSH
   -1gram tylenol prn fever

   # ARF: Creatinine has ranged 1.0-2.0 in past 3 months, baseline likely
   1-1.3.  Currently she has decreasing cr post procedure that is
   resolving with fluids giving some creedednce to a pre-renal etiology
   for ARF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis, who presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after undergoing lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F) with a current temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 107 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 98-117 bpm
* Blood pressure: 116/60 mmHg with a normal range of 93-120/59-80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (ins/min) with a normal range of 21-31 ins/min
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Tachycardia with a regular rhythm and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Minimal rhales in the lower lobes of the lungs
* Soft and non-tender abdomen with + bowel sounds
* No edema or changes in the extremities

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 29.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 27.2%
* Platelet count: 350 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 138 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, anemia, and hypokalemia.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Fever: The patient is at high risk for bacterial infection or bacteremia, particularly given her recent GU manipulation and positive urine culture. Empiric antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.
* Tachycardia: The patient is likely dehydrated based on her subjective thirst, fever, and prolonged NPO status prior to the procedure. IV and PO hydration have been ordered, and the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level will be checked.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has decreased since the procedure, which suggests a pre-renal etiology for the ARF. IV fluids and antibiotics will continue, and the patient will be reevaluated for repeat GU imaging if her condition does not improve.
* Hypokalemia: The patient is likely diuresed some potassium, and oral potassium repletion will be ordered as needed.
* Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and has undergone lithotripsy and ureteral stent replacement. She will be followed up with urology recommendations.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure will be monitored, and her atenolol medication will be continued. Her HCTZ and ACEI medications will be held acutely.
* Diabetes: The patient's oral antihyperglycemic medications will be held, and she will be started on a diabetic diet and HISS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial infection
* Acute kidney injury or worsening kidney function
* Hypokalemia or other electrolyte imbalances
* Dehydration or worsening dehydration
* Nephrolithiasis or worsening nephrolithiasis
* Hypertension or worsening hypertension
* Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome
* C. difficile colitis or other gastrointestinal complications

The patient's condition will need to be closely monitored, and adjustments to her treatment plan will be made as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis and nephrolithiasis. She underwent ureteral stent replacement and lithotripsy, but developed post-operative tachycardia and fever, which is concerning for sepsis. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Flagyl, CTX, and Cipro, to cover for possible urinary sources of infection. Her abdominal exam is reassuring, with no evidence of diverticulitis or intraperitoneal process. The patient has acute renal failure, and IV fluids have been administered to support volume. She is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis worsening: The patient's sepsis may continue to progress, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as dialysis.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient may develop a urinary tract infection, which could lead to further complications such as pyelonephritis.
4. Influenza: The patient may have influenza, which could lead to further complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient may develop gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea or constipation, which could worsen her sepsis.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient may develop neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status, which could worsen her sepsis.
9. Infection Spread: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of her body, leading to further complications.
10. Delayed Recovery: The patient's recovery may be delayed due to the severity of her illness and the need for further interventions."

   -micro data- GNR in blood from [**5-16**], started cefepime (curbsided ID, if
   decompensates, give meropenem); uro attdg was concerned that patient
   had +bcx after dose of ceftriaxone; however, ID agreed that cefepime
   offers better GNR/pseudomonal coverage than ceftriaxone and was the
   next best antibiotic to use
   -cefepime (pseudomonas) + vanco (enterococcus), stopped Cipro
   -Flaygl (empiric C dif)
   -CT [**Last Name (un) 42**]/pelv- 1. interval placement of ureteral stent, 2. minimal
   residual nephrolithiasis, 3. no evidence of further diverticulitis, 4.
   left adrenal adenoma
   -CXR- there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could
   reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac silhouette
   appears somewhat more prominent, supporting this diagnosis. There is
   also some increasing opacification at the left base consistent with
   atelectasis and possible small pleural effusion.
   -progressed diet- ADAT
   -wrote for prn nebs for wheezing
   -difficult access for lab draws; consider A-line versus PICC

   # Fever: High fever with rigors concerning for bacterial
   infection/bacteremia.  Given recent GU manipulation most likely source
   is urine, especially given positive UA.  Pt has history of recent
   antibiotic tx raising concern for c. diff and now with elevated WBC
   count there is a high concern for C. diff even without diarrhea.  Also
   had treatment for diverticulitis 2 months ago with associated
   microperforation, although non-tender on abd exam with no recent abd
   pain or change in stool.  Did have relatively recent knee tap, but
   without evidence for prior or ongoing infection in the joint.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -micro data- GNR in blood from [**5-16**], started cefepime (curbsided ID, if
   decompensates, give meropenem); uro attdg was concerned that patient
   had +bcx after dose of ceftriaxone; however, ID agreed that cefepime
   offers better GNR/pseudomonal coverage than ceftriaxone and was the
   next best antibiotic to use
   -cefepime (pseudomonas) + vanco (enterococcus), stopped Cipro
   -Flaygl (empiric C dif)
   -CT [**Last Name (un) 42**]/pelv- 1. interval placement of ureteral stent, 2. minimal
   residual nephrolithiasis, 3. no evidence of further diverticulitis, 4.
   left adrenal adenoma
   -CXR- there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could
   reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The cardiac silhouette
   appears somewhat more prominent, supporting this diagnosis. There is
   also some increasing opacification at the left base consistent with
   atelectasis and possible small pleural effusion.
   -progressed diet- ADAT
   -wrote for prn nebs for wheezing
   -difficult access for lab draws; consider A-line versus PICC
   -Urine and blood cx from [**5-16**] growing budding yeast, started on
   fluconazole
   -Started on IV fluids for low bicarb and increasing anion gap

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis. She presented to the ICU with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after undergoing lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Fever: High fever with rigors, concerning for bacterial infection or bacteremia, likely originating from the urinary tract.
2. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia, likely due to dehydration and febrility.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Decreasing creatinine levels post-procedure, potentially due to pre-renal etiology.
4. Hypokalemia: Potassium levels decreased, likely due to diuresis and fluid therapy.
5. Nephrolithiasis: Patient underwent lithotripsy and ureteral stent replacement.
6. Hypertension: Patient has a history of hypertension, currently being managed with atenolol.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, currently being managed with dietary restrictions and HISS.

The patient's lab results indicate:

* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 29.9-26.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet Count (Plt): 350-331 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.8-1.7 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 17 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138-163 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Potassium (K+): 3.9 mEq/L, Sodium (Na+): 137 mEq/L, Chloride (Cl-): 25.4%
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.6/26.1/1.3, Differential-Neuts: 93.0%, Band: 7.0%, Lymph: 0.0%, Mono: 0.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.8 g/dL, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

1. Empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for potential urinary tract source and C. difficile coverage.
2. Tylenol PRN for fever.
3. CT abdomen to look for evidence of colitis or diverticulitis.
4. Aggressive IVF and PO hydration for ARF.
5. Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely.
6. Consider repeat GU imaging if ARF persists.
7. Replete potassium orally as needed.
8. Continue atenolol for hypertension.
9. Hold oral antihyperglycemics for diabetes mellitus.
10. Follow-up with urology recommendations.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial infection or bacteremia.
2. C. difficile colitis or diverticulitis.
3. ARF or worsening kidney function.
4. Hypokalemia or worsening electrolyte imbalance.
5. Nephrolithiasis or ureteral stent complications.
6. Hypertensive crisis or worsening blood pressure control.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis or worsening hyperglycemia.
8. Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to atelectasis or small pleural effusion.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, recent diverticulitis, and nephrolithiasis, who presented with fevers, rigors, and tachycardia after lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. She has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia and candidemia, and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Her condition has improved overnight, with a decrease in fever and leukocytosis. She has also experienced a mild decrease in bicarbonate levels, which is being monitored and treated with IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and candidemia pose a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have ranged from 1.0-2.0 in the past three months, and her current levels are decreasing, which may indicate a pre-renal etiology for AKI.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis may be caused by lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or diarrhea, and requires close monitoring and treatment.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may be caused by diuresis, and requires close monitoring and treatment.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of HTN and DM2 may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia.
6. Left Adrenal Mass: The patient's incidentally discovered left adrenal mass may be benign or malignant, and requires further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancomycin and cefepime for GNR bacteremia and candidemia.
2. Monitor the patient's bicarbonate levels and treat any metabolic acidosis promptly.
3. Continue IV fluids to manage AKI and hypokalemia.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat any respiratory complications promptly.
5. Further evaluate and treat the patient's left adrenal mass.
6. Consider repeat GU imaging to ensure no new obstruction in the setting of instrumentation.
7. Hold lisinopril and HCTZ acutely to manage HTN.
8. Continue atenolol and hold HCTZ/ACEI as above.
9. Hold oral antihyperglycemics and manage DM with diabetic diet and HISS.
10. F/u urology recs for nephrolithiasis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 69-year-old female admitted with nephrolithiasis, who has undergone ureteral stent placement and lithotripsy. She has developed significant bacteremia and fungemia with a likely urinary source. Despite reasonable response to fluids, the patient has worsening acidosis, acute renal failure, and sepsis. She is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl) and IV fluids, and further management is being planned.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis**: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. **Acidosis**: The patient's acidosis may be related to renal failure, diarrhea, and NS given, which may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further compromise of her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. **Acute Renal Failure**: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly and effectively, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
4. **Fungemia**: The patient's fungemia may lead to further complications, such as septic shock, disseminated fungal infection, and organ failure, if not properly managed.
5. **Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)**: The patient's need for central access may increase the risk of CLABSI, which can lead to serious complications, including sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
6. **Ventricular Arrhythmias**: The patient's tachycardia may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and mortality.
7. **Respiratory Failure**: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and increased morbidity and mortality.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary based on culture results and patient response.
3. Manage acidosis with bicarbonate administration and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Continue IV fluids and consider diuretics to manage fluid overload.
5. Consider placement of a PICC line to minimize blood draws and reduce the risk of CLABSI.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider antiarrhythmic therapy if necessary.
7. Consider respiratory support, including non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation, if necessary."
