You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, with multiple comorbidities, including advanced laryngeal cancer, COPD, and anemia. The patient has experienced a significant gastrointestinal bleed, requiring transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells and surgical oversewing of the bleeding site. The patient also has a left lower lobe pneumonia, which is not progressing, and is receiving antimicrobial therapy for a 7-day course. The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, likely due to demand ischemia, and is experiencing expressive aphasia and confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's significant blood loss due to the gastrointestinal bleed puts them at risk for hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleed increase their risk for developing secondary infections, which can worsen their condition.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and anemia increase their risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and anemia can lead to respiratory failure, which can worsen their condition and increase their risk for mortality.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's expressive aphasia and confusion may be indicative of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures, which can worsen their condition.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's anemia and recent blood transfusions increase their risk for thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed and anemia increase their risk for gastrointestinal complications, including perforation, obstruction, and bleeding."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and has a history of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy for upper gastrointestinal bleed 4 days ago and has been experiencing ongoing melena. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 98.5°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 129 bpm, blood pressure of 151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 1.5 LPM. The patient's chest x-ray shows a possible effusion on the left side and stable bibasilar infiltrates. 

The patient has a history of anemia, and his recent laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 10.9 K/uL, and his platelet count is 91 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 23 mEq/L, and his creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.09 ng/mL, and his lactic acid level is 0.8 mmol/L. 

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.53, pCO2 of 33 mmHg, and pO2 of 69 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, with soft and non-tender abdominal wounds. The patient's neurologic examination shows that he is attentive and follows simple commands. 

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including pneumonia, hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may be related to mucus plugging, and his gastrointestinal bleed may be related to recent surgery and ongoing melena. The patient's altered mental status may be related to recent head trauma and may require further evaluation. 

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for pneumonia, captopril and metoprolol for hypertension, and holding ASA and plavix for gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through a gastrostomy tube, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleed. He is undergoing XRT and had undergone an exploratory laparotomy for upper gastrointestinal bleed 4 days ago. The patient has developed a larger effusion and infiltrates on chest x-ray, requiring increased oxygen support. He is experiencing tachypnea, hypertension, and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 98.5°F (36.9°C)
* Heart rate: 129 bpm
* Blood pressure: 151/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96% on 1.5 LPM

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.4-10.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 91-248 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Overweight/obese
* Soft, non-tender, stapled abdominal wound
* Absent radial and pedal pulses on both sides
* Edema in both lower extremities
* Neurological examination shows attentive patient, following simple commands, and responding to stimuli

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and increased oxygen requirements suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count indicate a potential risk of sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed and recent surgery increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia, which is likely hospital-acquired, may worsen and require further antibiotic therapy.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential sepsis increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and recent head CT unrevealing may indicate a risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure.
8. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed and recent surgery increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status, as well as his laboratory results and imaging studies."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 78 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute. He has a history of recent bleed and has been on hold for antibiotics and antiplatelet agents. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tunneled Hickman line inserted.

Physically, the patient appears pleasant and well-appearing, with no signs of trauma or conjunctival pallor. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with a regular rhythm and normal rate. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 351 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 13.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.09 ng/mL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hypertension, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. He has been receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, pain control, and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory acidosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Pneumonia: Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction.
* Gastrointestinal bleed: Hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, and electrolyte imbalances.
* Hypertension: Hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and cardiac complications.
* Neurological symptoms: Stroke, seizures, and cerebral edema.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve his overall outcome."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary
   PPx: SCDs and PPI
   Access: Right Hickman (single lumen), midline both placed at OSH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of laryngeal cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with hospitalization complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) following an esophageal laparotomy. The patient is currently on day 9 of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for HAP and has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR) suggesting possible aspiration event or pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of hypertension, and the CXR also shows slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, which could be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or underlying failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk for respiratory failure due to the development of a new infiltrate on CXR.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a high risk of PE due to recent surgical procedure, active malignancy, and DVT prophylaxis only with sequential compression devices (SCDs).
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for further bleeding due to the ongoing use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for further complications due to the ongoing use of antihypertensive medications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk for cardiac complications due to the ongoing use of anticoagulant medications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of altered mental status and is at risk for further neurological complications due to the ongoing use of sedatives and analgesics.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for HAP and has a new infiltrate on CXR suggesting possible aspiration event or pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for further complications due to the ongoing use of antihypertensive medications. The patient has a history of GIB and is at risk for further bleeding due to the ongoing use of anticoagulant medications. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk for cardiac complications due to the ongoing use of anticoagulant medications. The patient has a history of altered mental status and is at risk for further neurological complications due to the ongoing use of sedatives and analgesics.

The plan is to continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for HAP, continue antihypertensive medications, and monitor the patient's condition closely for any signs of further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  PE is a possibility in a patient with tachycardia
   and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient is at high
   risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy, and DVT
   prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Finally, intracardiac shunt may be
   Tracheal edema appears to be less likely as the patient has had no
   problems with ventilation.  COPD exacerbation also unlikely given lack
   of wheezing on exam.  Patient received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary
   PPx: SCDs and PPI
   Access: Right Hickman (single lumen), midline both placed at OSH.

Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old female with laryngeal cancer, CAD, and COPD, is admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) following an upper endoscopy and is currently on day 9 of antibiotics. The patient's oxygen requirements have been fluctuating overnight, and a neuro consult has been obtained, suspecting a possible right temporal stroke. A head and neck MRI has been ordered, but the patient refused. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the neurologist recommends keeping it between 160-200 mmHg.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, and blood pressure of 173/90 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 88%. She is on aerosol-cool face tent oxygen therapy and has a slight A-a gradient.

The patient's physical examination reveals a drowsy patient who follows commands but is nonverbal. Her neurologic examination is limited due to her altered mental status. She has diffuse crackles and decreased breath sounds in her lungs, and her abdomen is soft and nontender.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 351 K/uL. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary concerns are respiratory failure, acute pain, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on day 9 of antibiotics for HAP and has a high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her recent surgical procedure, active malignancy, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she has a slight A-a gradient, which may indicate respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen requirements have been fluctuating, and she may require further oxygen therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at high risk of developing a PE due to her recent surgical procedure, active malignancy, and DVT prophylaxis. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) has been ordered to rule out PE.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a history of GIB and is at risk of further bleeding. Her hemoglobin level is slightly elevated, but she may require further transfusions.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she may require further medication to control her hypertension.
5. Stroke: The patient's neurologist suspects a possible right temporal stroke, and a head and neck MRI has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for HAP and monitor the patient's response.
2. Obtain a CTA to rule out PE.
3. Continue oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's oxygen requirements.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medication as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust transfusions as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust medication as necessary.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, to rule out stroke."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements
 ranging from
   4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2.  Suctioning copius, bloody thick plugs
   from nasopharynx and back of throat.  Possible etiologies of increased
   oxygen requirements most likely include mucus plug with inability to
   clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP,
   aspiration event, intracardiac shunt or pulmonary emboli.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - TTE to evaluate volume status and possible PFO (see below)
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and has
   continued to have guiac positive stools.  She is now POD 4 from
   ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee grounds.
   Serial Hct have been stable
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists.
   Likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure,
   intubation, respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with
   question of parietal lobe hypodensity.  Neurology consult suspects
   right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left
   sided hypoaesthesia.  Neuro also recommended MRI/MRA of head and neck
   which the patient refused.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - talk to neuro regarding starting ASA, hold off on plavix
   - carotid dopplers and TTE with bubble study to evaluate for source of
   possible emboli
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   -Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   -neuro recommends keeping BP elevated from 160-200 to prevent further
   ischemia
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates hemodynamic
   instability or additional melanotic stools will hold cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of laryngeal cancer, CAD, and COPD, admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap, now transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements ranging from 4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2, with possible etiologies including mucus plug, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, intracardiac shunt, or pulmonary emboli.
* Melena: Patient has had one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and has continued to have guiac positive stools. Serial Hct have been stable.
* HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo, with plans to continue current antimicrobials.
* AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists, likely due to toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation, respiratory distress, and HAP.
* HTN: BP currently elevated at 180/100, with plans to titrate BP meds.
* Onc: Per primary oncologist, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
* CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
* COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's fluctuating oxygen requirements and possible etiologies of increased oxygen requirements, such as mucus plug, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, intracardiac shunt, or pulmonary emboli, may lead to respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guiac positive stools and melena may indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
* Stroke: The patient's suspected right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left sided hypoaesthesia may lead to further neurological complications, such as increased risk of bleeding, embolism, or even death.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponins and history of CAD may indicate ongoing cardiac complications, such as ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's HAP and GIB may lead to further infections, such as sepsis, septic shock, or even death.
* Neurological complications: The patient's fluctuating altered mental status and suspected right temporal stroke may lead to further neurological complications, such as increased risk of bleeding, embolism, or even death.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue current antimicrobials for HAP.
* Trend Hct and transfuse as necessary to prevent anemia.
* Monitor mental status and neurological function.
* Continue cardiac medications, such as statin, ACE-I, and BB, and titrate BP meds to maintain a BP of 160-200.
* Continue respiratory support, such as oxygen therapy and nebs.
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding complications.
* Consider further imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, to evaluate for possible stroke or other neurological complications.
* Consult with neurology and cardiology services to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of laryngeal cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and developed gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) after an exploratory laparotomy. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has fluctuating oxygen requirements, ranging from 4L O2 to high-flow 50% FiO2. She has copious, bloody, thick plugs from the nasopharynx and back of the throat. Possible etiologies of increased oxygen requirements include mucus plugs, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, intracardiac shunt, or pulmonary emboli.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has had one black, tarry bowel movement and continues to have guaiac-positive stools. She is on day 4 from the exploratory laparotomy. Suctioning from the gastrostomy tube has been without blood or coffee grounds. Serial hemoglobin (Hb) levels have been stable.
* Neurological: The patient has fluctuating altered mental status, likely due to toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation, respiratory distress, and HAP. A neurology consult suspects a right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left-sided hypaesthesia.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypertension, with a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. The neurologist recommends keeping the blood pressure elevated from 160-200 mmHg to prevent further ischemia.
* Infectious: The patient has HAP and GIB. She is on day 9 of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn).
* Oncological: The patient has laryngeal cancer and is receiving treatment according to her primary oncologist's recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's fluctuating oxygen requirements and need for high-flow oxygen may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's HAP may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or death.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's continued guaiac-positive stools and black, tarry bowel movements may indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or death.
4. Stroke: The patient's suspected right temporal stroke may lead to further neurological deterioration, including weakness, paralysis, or cognitive impairment.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and troponin leak may indicate cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's HAP and GIB may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ failure, shock, or death.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's increased oxygen requirements and pulmonary edema may indicate a pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or death.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, cardiovascular, and infectious conditions. She should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, stroke, cardiac complications, sepsis, and pulmonary embolism."

   # Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements
 ranging from
   4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2.  Suctioning copius, bloody thick plugs
   from nasopharynx and back of throat.  Possible etiologies of increased
   oxygen requirements most likely include mucus plug with inability to
   clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP,
   aspiration event, intracardiac shunt or pulmonary emboli.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - TTE to evaluate volume status and possible PFO (see below)
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.

   Serial Hct have been stable
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists.
   Likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure,
   intubation, respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with
   question of parietal lobe hypodensity.  Neurology consult suspects
   right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements
 ranging from
   4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2.  Suctioning copius, bloody thick plugs
   from nasopharynx and back of throat.  Possible etiologies of increased
   oxygen requirements most likely include mucus plug with inability to
   clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP,
   aspiration event, intracardiac shunt or pulmonary emboli.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - TTE to evaluate volume status and possible PFO (see below)
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and has
   continued to have guiac positive stools.  She is now POD 4 from
   ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee grounds.
   Serial Hct have been stable
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists.
   Likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure,
   intubation, respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with
   question of parietal lobe hypodensity.  Neurology consult suspects
   right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left
   sided hypoaesthesia.  Neuro also recommended MRI/MRA of head and neck
   which the patient refused.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - talk to neuro regarding starting ASA, hold off on plavix
   - carotid dopplers and TTE with bubble study to evaluate for source of
   possible emboli
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   -Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   -neuro recommends keeping BP elevated from 160-200 to prevent further
   ischemia
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates hemodynamic
   instability or additional melanotic stools will hold cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Fluctuating oxygen requirements
 ranging from
   4L O2 to high flow 50% FiO2.  Suctioning copius, bloody thick plugs
   from nasopharynx and back of throat.  Possible etiologies of increased
   oxygen requirements most likely include mucus plug with inability to
   clear upper airway secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP,
   aspiration event, intracardiac shunt or pulmonary emboli.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - TTE to evaluate volume status and possible PFO (see below)
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement yesterday and has
   continued to have guiac positive stools.  She is now POD 4 from
   ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee grounds.
   Serial Hct have been stable
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Fluctuating altered mental status s/p extubation persists.
   Likely toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure,
   intubation, respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with
   question of parietal lobe hypodensity.  Neurology consult suspects
   right temporal stroke with mild left upper extremity weakness and left
   sided hypoaesthesia.  Neuro also recommended MRI/MRA of head and neck
   which the patient refused.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - talk to neuro regarding starting ASA, hold off on plavix
   - carotid dopplers and TTE with bubble study to evaluate for source of
   possible emboli
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   -Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   -neuro recommends keeping BP elevated from 160-200 to prevent further
   ischemia
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**]
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates hemodynamic
   instability or additional melanotic stools will hold cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary
   PPx: SCDs and PPI
   Access: Right Hickman (single lumen), midline both placed at OSH.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has

   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8531**] is a 73 year old female with laryngeal CA, CAD, and COPD
   admitted for HAP with hospitalization complicated by GIB s/p ex-lap now
   transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Now resolved.  Patient with increased oxygen
   requirement and an A-A gradient with preserved ventilation.
   Differential includes mucus plug with inability to clear upper airway
   secretions, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or
   pulmonary emboli.  The patient is covered adequately for her HAP with
   vanco and pip/tazo (day 9).  The development of a new infiltrate from
   an aspiration event is possible, although this may be less likely given
   the lack of residuals from her TF. Repeat CXR compared to [**8-6**] suggests
   slightly increased vascular congestion and edema, suggesting possible
   component of volume overload.  In the setting of the patient's
   hypertension, this could also be secondary to flash pulmonary edema or
   underlying failure.  Finally, PE is a possibility in a patient with
   tachycardia and an increased O2 requirement, especially as the patient
   is at high risk with a recent surgical procedure, active malignancy,
   and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.  Tracheal edema appears to be less
   likely as the patient has had no problems with ventilation.  COPD
   exacerbation also unlikely given lack of wheezing on exam.  Patient
   received 20 mg IV lasix on transfer.
   - Deep suctioning prn
   - Continue vanco and pip/tazo (day 9). If patient spikes or further
   decompensates, add levoflox.
   - Continue nebs
   - Wean supplemental O2 with goal SaO2>90%
   - Obtain OSH TTE if available.
   - Sputum and blood cultures.
   - Hold on CTA to rule out PE for now, as this is low likelihood.
   - Hold further corticosteroids for now.
   # Melena: Patient with one black tarry bowel movement this AM.  She is
   now POD 4 from ex-lap.  Suctioning from g-tube without blood or coffee
   grounds.
   - Trend hct Q12H today, transfuse for hct<21 or if patient has
   additional melena or hematochezia.
   - Maintain active T+S, cross-matched for 3 units PRBC.
   - Follow-up with GI and surgery in AM.
   # HAP: Currently on day 9 vanco and pip/tazo.
   - Continue current antimicrobials.
   # AMS: Altered mental status s/p extubation persists. Likely
   toxic-metabolic secondary to recent surgical procedure, intubation,
   respiratory distress and HAP.  CTH attending read with question of
   parietal lobe hypodensity.
   - Monitor mental status.
   - Per primary onc, consult neuro.
   # HTN: BP currently elevated 180/100.  Given concern of possible
   increased pulmonary edema and vascular congestion, will titrate BP
   meds.
   - Continue metoprolol and captopril.
   # Onc: Per primary oncologist
   # CAD: Troponins elevated to 0.15 trending down to 0.12 earlier in
   admission with flat MB likely representing demand ischemia in setting
   of pneumonia. Hold ASA and plavix pending stabilization of GIB.
   - Continue statin, ACE-I, and BB.
   # COPD: Continue albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
   # CAD: Patient with troponin leak during initial admission with flak CK
   suggestive of demand ischemia in setting of HAP.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin, BB, and ACE-I. If patient demonstrates
   hemodynamic instability or additional melanotic stools will hold
   cardiac meds.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   # Anemia: Trend hct and transfuse as necessary as above.
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary
   PPx: SCDs and PPI
   Access: Right Hickman (single lumen), midline both placed at OSH.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes mucus plug, pulmonary edema, worsening HAP, aspiration event, or pulmonary emboli.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a recent gastrointestinal bleed, and the risk of further bleeding is high.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, and the risk of further complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure, is high.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at high risk for DVT due to recent surgery, active malignancy, and DVT prophylaxis only with sequential compression devices (SCDs).
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at high risk for PE due to recent surgery, active malignancy, and DVT prophylaxis only with SCDs.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and the risk of hyperglycemia-related complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, is high.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been low, and the risk of anemia-related complications, such as cardiovascular instability, is high.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the risk of hypertensive complications, such as cardiac failure or cerebral edema, is high.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient has cardiac disease, and the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, is high.
10. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, and the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, is high.

The patient's care plan should focus on addressing these potential complications and managing their underlying medical conditions."
