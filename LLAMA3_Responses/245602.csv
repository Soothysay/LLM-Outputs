   HPI:
   63M admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, E Coli bacteremia,
   septic shock from biliary source. Had perc chole tube placed for
   cholecystitis. Intubated for respiratory failure. Ruled in and echo
   showed EF 25-30% with global hypokinesis. Then developed ischemia of
   RLE leading to right AKA [**3-1**]. Also had lap chole at that time.
   Extubated post-operatively. Post-op amylase and lipase rose and fevers
   returned. Felt to need a MRCP though some concern about glass shrapnel
   in eye so transferred for ERCP.
   Has developed worsening delirium over past couple of days.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for 12 days with a diagnosis of cholecystitis, bacteremia, and septic shock from a biliary source. He has undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, had a percutaneous cholecyst tube placed, and has been intubated for respiratory failure. He has also developed ischemia of the right lower extremity leading to a right above-knee amputation. He has been experiencing worsening delirium over the past couple of days.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93%. He is receiving morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for pain management, acid suppression, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated pancreatic enzymes and transaminases, with a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 647 K/uL. His troponin-T level is 0.16 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show low lung volumes on a chest X-ray, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) shows normal sinus rhythm with inferior Q waves.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Cholecystitis, bacteremia, recent lap chole, rising pancreatic enzymes, and transaminases - needs updated imaging to evaluate pancreas and possible retained stone.
* MI, cardiomyopathy - continue beta blocker, hold anti-platelet therapy for now, eventual statin.
* Delirium - will follow, apparently had unremarkable CT, may be EtOH and benzo withdrawal, will use benzos as needed.
* PVD, post-op AKA - continued wound care.
* ICU care - nutrition: NPO for now, glycemic control: lines, prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's rising pancreatic enzymes and transaminases may indicate pancreatitis, which can lead to severe complications such as necrosis, abscess, and sepsis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and recent myocardial infarction may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be a sign of underlying sepsis, medication toxicity, or withdrawal symptoms, which can worsen his condition if not addressed promptly.
4. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and septic shock may increase his risk of developing other infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy may increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or respiratory failure.
6. Wound complications: The patient's post-operative wound care may increase his risk of developing wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or seroma.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of EtOH and cocaine abuse may increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or brain hemorrhage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: delerium, rising pancreatic enzymes
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   63M admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, E Coli bacteremia,
   septic shock from biliary source. Had perc chole tube placed for
   cholecystitis. Intubated for respiratory failure. Ruled in and echo
   showed EF 25-30% with global hypokinesis. Then developed ischemia of
   RLE leading to right AKA [**3-1**]. Also had lap chole at that time.
   Extubated post-operatively. Post-op amylase and lipase rose and fevers
   returned. Felt to need a MRCP though some concern about glass shrapnel
   in eye so transferred for ERCP.
   Has developed worsening delerium over past couple of days.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old male, is currently in the ICU with a complex medical history. He was admitted 12 days ago with abdominal pain, fever, and E. coli bacteremia, which led to septic shock and respiratory failure. He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparotomy, and placement of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. He developed ischemia of the right lower extremity, leading to a right above-knee amputation (AKA). He was extubated post-operatively but has since developed worsening delirium, rising pancreatic enzymes, and transaminases.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His physical examination reveals a patient who is awake and able to respond to simple commands, but is disoriented and has baseline facial asymmetry. His abdomen is tender to palpation, and his extremities show signs of recent AKA.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and pancreatic enzymes, as well as abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal low lung volumes on chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG) showing normal sinus rhythm with inferior Q waves.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary diagnoses include cholecystitis, bacteremia, and pancreatitis, which require updated imaging to evaluate the pancreas and possible retained stone. He will receive 2 weeks of antibiotics and undergo further discussion with the gastroenterology team regarding the need for MRCP or ERCP. He also has a history of MI and cardiomyopathy, which require continued beta-blocker therapy and hold on anti-platelet therapy.

The patient's delirium is being managed with benzodiazepines as needed, and his PVD and post-op AKA require continued wound care. His ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's rising pancreatic enzymes and transaminases suggest ongoing pancreatitis, which can lead to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of bacteremia and ongoing infection can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI and cardiomyopathy make him at risk for further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium can worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to further complications such as falls, respiratory failure, and increased mortality.
5. Wound complications: The patient's post-op AKA and PVD make him at risk for wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, and delayed healing.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory support make him at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure."
150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.

150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and fever. He was diagnosed with septic shock and E. coli bacteremia, and was treated with meropenem and vasopressors. He developed NSTEMI with a peak troponin level of 37.88 and had worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.

The patient underwent RKE AKA and cholecystectomy on [**3-1**] and was extubated on the same day. Post-operatively, he developed increasing amylase and lipase levels, and his temperature increased to 100.8°F.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.3°C (99.2°F), HR: 95 bpm, BP: 152/80 mmHg, RR: 25 breaths/min, SpO2: 94%
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 11.9 K/uL
	+ Hct: 33.5%
	+ Plt: 647 K/uL
	+ Cr: 0.5 mg/dL
	+ TropT: 0.16 ng/mL
	+ Glucose: 105 mg/dL
	+ Amylase: 516 U/L
	+ Lipase: 241 U/L
* Imaging studies:
	+ Chest X-ray: Normal
* Medical conditions:
	+ Septic shock
	+ NSTEMI
	+ RLE ischemia
	+ Cholecystitis
	+ Pancreatitis
* Medications:
	+ Meropenem
	+ Vasopressors
	+ Pantoprazole
	+ Heparin
	+ Metoprolol
	+ Morphine
* Plan:
	+ Continue ICU care
	+ Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction
	+ Manage pain and discomfort
	+ Monitor for signs of bleeding and bleeding complications

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* NSTEMI and cardiac complications
* RLE ischemia and gangrene
* Cholecystitis and pancreatitis
* Pancreatic necrosis and abscess
* Biliary obstruction and jaundice
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding or hematuria

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.
   6.       Pt received some PRN haldol for agitation at about 1:30am.
   7.       Pt given morphine at 6:10am for presumed pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and AKA, and is now off pressors with stable vitals. He has a history of PVD, EtOH abuse, and COPD. His current conditions include:

* Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs
* NSTEMI
* Altered mental status/neuro deficits
* RLE ischemia/PVD
* Fever/leukocytosis
* Diarrhea
* Anemia
* Polysubstance abuse

Potential medical complications:

1. Retained CBD stone: Given the patient's history of biliary disease and the lack of recent imaging, there is a possibility of a retained CBD stone.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs may be due to a variety of causes, including retained CBD stone, ischemic injury, medication toxicity, or viral hepatitis.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's history of severe PVD and NSTEMI may increase his risk of cardiac complications.
4. Altered mental status/neuro deficits: The patient's altered mental status and neuro deficits may be due to infection, ICU setting, lab abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
5. RLE ischemia/PVD: The patient's RLE ischemia and PVD may be due to progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by the effects of pressors.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to a variety of causes, including C. difficile infection, colitis, or medication side effects.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or medication side effects.
8. Polysubstance abuse: The patient's history of polysubstance abuse may increase his risk of medical complications and worsen his mental status.

Assessment and Plan:

* Continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
* Follow up blood, urine cultures, and C. diff toxins.
* CT abdomen with contrast to evaluate for CBD measurements and stone, pancreatic inflammation, and other reasons for transaminase elevation.
* Plain film series to evaluate for possible metal shrapnel in the eye to preclude MRCP.
* Follow up with ERCP team.
* Follow up Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated transaminases.
* Continue metoprolol and heparin as ordered.
* Start Plavix if ERCP is not in the future.
* Consider statin therapy once transaminitis resolves.
* Talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
* Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
* SW consult once mental status improves.
* Type and screen for blood transfusion.
* Continue home albuterol and ipratropium for COPD."

   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C, consider [**Doctor First Name **], IgG for eval of other causes of
   elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia.
   - continue ertapenem
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - obtain sensis from OSH.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol
   withdrawal.   Neuro exam was difficult with poor participation last
   evening but more and consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially
   some concern for facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior
   accident), tongue deviation, and seems to be favoring use of LUE though
   cannot get great exam to verify this.
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - Minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - If mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - Would like to start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such
   bad PVD) - will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently 98.4.
   WBCs overall improving.
   - followup blood and urine cultures.  C.diff.
   - CXR.
   - Biliary workup as above.
   - Covering with meropenem.
   .
   # ?Aspiration pneumonia.  Areas of posterior consolidation particularly
   on right side on OSH chest CT report - good location for aspiration.
   Minimal findings on CXR here.
   - review images from OSH scan.
   - Continue current meropenem for now without addition of other
   antibiotics (images now >1week old).
   - Discuss with OSH ?speech and swallow eval - per verbal report,
   nothing in papers.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if was graft or
   arterial thrombus formation vs. global effects of pressors.
   - Consider plavix but will hold off for now with ?MRCP.
   - Needs statin as well.
   - Examine incision site at next dressing change.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink over a week ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  From recent infection and acute stressors most
   likely.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.
   6.       Pt received some PRN haldol for agitation at about 1:30am

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C, consider [**Doctor First Name **], IgG for eval of other causes of
   elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia.
   - continue ertapenem
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - obtain sensis from OSH.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol
   withdrawal.   Neuro exam was difficult with poor participation last
   evening but more and consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially
   some concern for facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior
   accident), tongue deviation, and seems to be favoring use of LUE though
   cannot get great exam to verify this.
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - Minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - If mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - Would like to start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such
   bad PVD) - will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently 98.4.
   WBCs overall improving.
   - followup blood and urine cultures.  C.diff.
   - CXR.
   - Biliary workup as above.
   - Covering with meropenem.
   .
   # ?Aspiration pneumonia.  Areas of posterior consolidation particularly
   on right side on OSH chest CT report - good location for aspiration.
   Minimal findings on CXR here.
   - review images from OSH scan.
   - Continue current meropenem for now without addition of other
   antibiotics (images now >1week old).
   - Discuss with OSH ?speech and swallow eval - per verbal report,
   nothing in papers.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if was graft or
   arterial thrombus formation vs. global effects of pressors.
   - Consider plavix but will hold off for now with ?MRCP.
   - Needs statin as well.
   - Examine incision site at next dressing change.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink over a week ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  From recent infection and acute stressors most
   likely.
   - Continue to monitor.
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock and bacteremia due to a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and amputation of the right lower extremity (RLE) due to ischemia. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently off pressors, with stable vital signs, and is being transferred to a different hospital for further management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Retained CBD stone: The patient's clinical scenario suggests the possibility of a retained CBD stone, which could lead to further complications if not addressed.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and the possibility of transaminitis due to ischemic, medication-related, viral, or other causes should be considered.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and he has a history of CAD, which increases his risk of developing a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's chest CT report from OSH shows areas of posterior consolidation, which could be indicative of aspiration pneumonia.
5. RLE ischemia/PVD: The patient's RLE ischemia could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Polysubstance abuse: The patient's history of ethanol and cocaine abuse increases his risk of developing complications related to substance abuse.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other causes, and should be further evaluated.
8. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be a response to his recent infection and acute stressors.
9. COPD: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases his risk of developing respiratory complications.
10. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis could be indicative of an ongoing infection, which should be further evaluated.

Recommendations:

1. CT abdomen with contrast to evaluate for CBD measurements, pancreatic inflammation, and other reasons for transaminase elevation.
2. Plain film series to evaluate for possible metal shrapnel in the eye to preclude MRCP.
3. Follow-up with the ERCP team.
4. Continue meropenem for now, but consider switching to a different antibiotic if the patient's blood and urine cultures are negative.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider involving neurology if it does not continue to improve.
6. Consider starting Plavix to prevent further thrombotic events.
7. Continue metoprolol and consider starting a statin to reduce the patient's risk of cardiovascular events.
8. Evaluate the patient's diarrhea and consider sending stool cultures and a C. difficile toxin test.
9. Consider a speech and swallow evaluation to assess the patient's risk of aspiration pneumonia.
10. Monitor the patient's wound healing and consider starting physical therapy to improve his mobility."
150822.0,245602,2117-03-05 07:39:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2117-3-4**] 09:19 PM
   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.
   6.       Pt received some PRN haldol for agitation at about 1:30am.
   7.       Pt given morphine at 6:10am for presumed pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

   Patient seen and examined agree with above. Will add, right PICC line
   with mild surrounding erythema. It was placed at OSH. Cultures negative
   and afebrile to date. Will plan for peripheral access and d/c of PICC
   line once ERCP/MRCP issue has been settled and there is no concern for
   impending sepsis where central access would be required.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 63M presents from OSH on evening of [**3-3**]. Originally
   admitted on [**2-22**] with abdominal pain, lethargy, disorientation, and
   fever to 105. Blood cultures grew E. coli and pt developed septic shock
   and was admitted to ICU.  Was intubated and required vasopressin and
   norepinephrine. Started on meropenem (later changed to ertapenem).
   RUQ US on [**2-22**] showed fatty liver, CBD 6mm, and distended gallbladder
   with thickened wall without pericholecystic fluid.  On [**2-24**] pt had
   cholecystic tube placed for gallbladder drainage.
   Pressors were weaned off but pt had NSTEMI on [**2-24**] with peak troponin
   of 37.88. Echo showed EF of 25-30% with global hyopkinesis. Pt also had
   worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses.
   On [**3-1**] pt had RKE AKA and cholecystectomy in OR. Extubated on same
   day. Post op pt had increasing amylase to 551 and lipase to 288 with
   temp to 100.8. OSH could not do MRCP because of possibility of shrapnel
   in pt's eye from war injury.  Transfer to [**Hospital1 1**] on [**3-3**] for possible
   ERCP.
   Additionally, pts wife notes worsening mental status and speech
   slurring since extubation on [**3-1**].  Pt does have baseline speech
   slurring partly due to MCC and resultant need for reconstructive
   surgery.

   On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]:
   1.       Pt interviewed and examined.
   2.       Spoke to wife [**Name (NI) 142**] on phone.
   3.       7:30am discussion with GI about possible ERCP today.  GI said
   questionable call because of no complaints of pain, benign abdominal
   exam, and normal bili levels.  Would appreciate CT abdomen.
   4.       Held ertapenem given possible resulting transaminitis.
   Started meropenem.
   5.       Gave banana bag for history of ETOH.
   6.       Pt received some PRN haldol for agitation at about 1:30am.

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   .
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.  Pancreatic enzymes initially
   normal and (as best as can be seen from notes) transaminases all <
   100.  No bili elevation now or previously.  Based on clinical scenario,
   OSH with some concern for retained CBD stone.  No recent/post op
   imaging to eval for this.
   Other possibilities for transaminitis include ischemic (though numbers
   low and now normotensive - timeline wrong), med effect (in particular
   ertapenem - c/w timeline of start of this med and can do this in [**5-16**]%
   of patients), viral or other acute hepatitis.  Triglycerides are
   normalPatient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty liver, no
   cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction evident.
   - CT abdomen with contrast this morning - looking for CBD measurements
   and stone, pancreatic inflammation, other reasons for transaminase
   elevation.
   - plain film series to eval for possible metal shrapnel in eye to
   preclude MRCP.  If negative, consider MRCP.
   - followup with ERCP team
   - followup Hep B, C for eval of other causes of elevated tranaminases.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # Septic shock/bacteremia.  Shock now resolved and normotensive with no
   evidence of poor perfusion.  Still needs treatment for bacteremia. PICC
   site appears somewhat red but is not excuisitely painful to palpation.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   - followup blood, urine cultures
   - keep PICC until after CT today, then d/c in favor of peripheral.
   .
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.  Patient
s alert and oriented
   x3 today (much improved from last evening).  Mental status overall much
   improved.  Delerium likely due to infection, ICU setting, lab
   abnormalities, washout of sedating meds, and possible alcohol or
   benzodiazepine withdrawal.  Pt has possible asterixis on exam   Neuro
   exam was difficult with poor participation last evening but more and
   consistent today.  Cranial nerves with initially some concern for
   facial nerve weakness (though explained by prior accident).
   TSH and B12 levels normal.
   - minimize sedating and pain meds though likely has some pain (and also
   at risk for withdrawal).
   - if mental status does not continue to improve, consider neurology
   involvement and/or head CT/MRI.
   - start lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating
   ammonia)
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis, however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus
   likely CAD) and may have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Inferior
   Q waves and poor transition - present on ECGs early this admission
   though unclear exactly how old.  Was on heparin early this admit, now
   off.
   - start Plavix as has ASA allergy (should be on with such bad PVD) -
   will start if ERCP not in future.
   - continue metoprolol.
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - determine what ASA allergy is.
   .
   # Diarrhea.  Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.
   Early CT abdomen with possible colitis.  C.diff negative at OSH per
   report.
   - C.diff toxin and stool culture.
   - CT abdomen as above.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis.  To 100.8 at OSH yesterday but currently afebrile
   at 98.4.  WBCs overall improving from 11.9 yesterday to 11.4 today.
   These findings are likely from prior sepsis, but could be from current
   biliary process.
   - followup blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
   - biliary workup as above.
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
   .
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.  Now s/p AKA as above.  Unclear if cause of
   peripheral ischemia was progression of chronic PVD or exacerbated by
   effects of pressors.
   - consider plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after
   ERCP today.
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
   - talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse.  EtOH and cocaine known.  However, patient
   last drink 10 days ago.  Received a banana bag last night.
   - Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
   - SW consult once mental status improving.
   .
   # Anemia.  Wife reports recent 2 unit prbc transfusion.  - checked Fe
   studies, TSH, folate, B12 all normal
   - guaiac stools.
   - type and screen here.
   .
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD
   - continue home albuterol and ipratropium

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and amputation of the right lower extremity (RLE) due to ischemia. He was intubated and required vasopressors, but they were weaned off. He developed NSTEMI with elevated troponin and CK levels. He also had worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications:

1. Biliary obstruction: The patient's bilirubin levels are normal, but he has a history of cholelithiasis and has undergone cholecystectomy. He may have a retained CBD stone that needs to be evaluated.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, and he has a history of pancreatitis. He may have developed pancreatitis secondary to his biliary obstruction or other causes.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, and he has a history of liver disease. He may have developed transaminitis secondary to his biliary obstruction or other causes.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has developed NSTEMI with elevated troponin and CK levels. He may have had a thrombotic infarct or may have developed it due to his hypotension and sepsis.
5. RLE ischemia: The patient has worsening RLE ischemia with no detectable distal pulses. He may require further interventions to improve blood flow to his RLE.
6. Sepsis: The patient has had septic shock and bacteremia. He may still be at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock.
7. Mental status changes: The patient has had altered mental status and is at risk for developing further changes.
8. Diarrhea: The patient has had diarrhea, which may be due to his biliary obstruction or other causes.
9. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has had fever and leukocytosis, which may be due to his biliary obstruction or other causes.
10. Anemia: The patient has had anemia, which may be due to his chronic PVD or other causes.

Recommendations:

1. Continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities.
2. Follow up blood and urine cultures and C. Diff toxins.
3. Biliary workup as above.
4. Consider Plavix (or aspirin if pt found to have no allergy) after ERCP today.
5. Start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves).
6. Talk to vascular surgery regarding amputation stump care.
7. Give another bag of D5, folate, MVI, thiamine.
8. SW consult once mental status improving.
9. Continue home albuterol and ipratropium.
10. Type and screen here.
11. Guaiac stools.
12. Consider MRCP if plain film series is negative."

   HEP C AB POSITIVE
   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative
   Blood cultures pending
   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.
   s/p lap chole for gangrenous cholecystitis. Rising LFTs concerning for
   retained stone vs leak so transferred here. ERCP without stone or leak.
   Transaminases, lipase, amylase trending down. ERCP c/w benign papillary
   stenosis. Now s/p sphincterotomy. Also hepC ab positive, though
   unlikely acute hepatitis. Patient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty
   liver, no cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction
   evident.
   - ERCP recs: still likely post-op illeus, cont IVF
   - cont trend LFTs, amylase/lipase
   # Sepsis
   [**2-9**] Ecoli from gangrenous cholecystitis
   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities, plan
   to treat 2wks from last psoitive culture
   - d/c PICC
   - f/u cultures
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.
   Mental status continues to improve. TSH and B12 levels normal
   - cont to monitor, reorient
   - cont lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia)
   # NSTEMI.
   Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of hypotension/sepsis,
   however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus likely CAD) and may
   have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Will need Plavix as has ASA
   allergy
   - can start plavix if no more procedures, crit has been stable
   - continue metoprolol, though has been held for bradycardia
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - likely will need f/u echo as outpatient
   # CHF, chronic , systolic, EF 25-[**6-6**] have been in setting of NSTEMI. Has been tolerating fluids well.
   - on beta blocker
   - consider ACE
   - 2g Na diet once advanced
   - Is/Os, daily weights
   - repeat ECHO as outpatient
   # Diarrhea.
   Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.  Early CT
   abdomen with possible colitis.
   - C.diff toxin negative, send 2 more
   - f/u final CT
   # ? aspiration/blunting left costophrenic angle
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - on meropenem
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.
   Now s/p AKA. Seen by vascular. Doesn
t need further management. F/u
   with [**Hospital1 1097**] surgeon 2 wks post-op.
   - q day dressing changes with kerlix
   - plavix once sure no more procesures
   - start statin as outpatient (after transaminitis resolves)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative
   Blood cultures pending

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative
   Blood cultures pending
   Assessment and Plan
   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.
   s/p lap chole for gangrenous cholecystitis. Rising LFTs concerning for
   retained stone vs leak so transferred here. ERCP without stone or leak.
   Transaminases, lipase, amylase trending down. ERCP c/w benign papillary
   stenosis. Now s/p sphincterotomy. Also hepC ab positive, though
   unlikely acute hepatitis. Patient with baseline EtOH abuse and fatty
   liver, no cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic dysfunction
   evident.
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - cont IVF
   - cont trend LFTs, amylase/lipase
   # Sepsis

   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities
   - d/c PICC
   - f/u cultures
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.
   Mental status continues to improve. TSH and B12 levels normal
   - cont to monitor, reorient
   - cont lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia)
   # NSTEMI.
   Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of hypotension/sepsis,
   however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus likely CAD) and may
   have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Will need Plavix as has ASA
   allergy
   - can start plavix if no more procedures, crit has been stable
   - continue metoprolol, though has been held for bradycardia
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - likely will need f/u echo as outpatient
   # CHF, chronic , systolic, EF 25-[**6-6**] have been in setting of NSTEMI. Has been tolerating fluids well.
   - on beta blocker
   - consider ACE
   - 2g Na diet once advanced
   - Is/Os, daily weights
   - repeat ECHO as outpatient
   # Diarrhea.
   Unclear how active recently but has flexiseal in place.  Early CT
   abdomen with possible colitis.
   - C.diff toxin negative
   - f/u final CT
   # ? aspiration/blunting left costophrenic angle
   - f/u repeat CXR
   - on meropenem
   # RLE ischemia/PVD.
   Now s/p AKA. Seen by vascular. Doesn
t need further management. F/u
   with [**Hospital1 1097**] surgeon 2 wks post-op.
   - q day dressing changes with kerlix
   - plavix once sure no more procesures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ethanol abuse, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted to the hospital with septic shock from a presumed biliary source and underwent cholecystectomy and amputation of the right lower extremity (AKA). He was transferred to the ICU for further management of his abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase.

The patient's recent events include an ERCP procedure without stone or leak, sphincterotomy, and removal of a plastic pancreatic duct stent. His LFTs and lipase are trending down, and he is being treated with meropenem for suspected sepsis. He has a history of NSTEMI, CHF, and chronic hepatitis C.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 87/33 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
* Respiratory support: no oxygen therapy is required.
* Cardiovascular: the patient has a history of NSTEMI and CHF, and is being treated with metoprolol and aspirin.
* Gastrointestinal: the patient has diarrhea, which is unclear whether it is active or not. He has a flexiseal in place and is being treated with lactulose to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia.
* Hepatic: the patient has chronic hepatitis C and abnormal LFTs, which are trending down.
* Renal: the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, but his current creatinine level is normal.
* Neurological: the patient has a history of altered mental status, which is improving.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: the patient is at risk for sepsis due to his recent ERCP procedure and the presence of bacteria in his bloodstream.
2. Liver failure: the patient's abnormal LFTs and lipase levels may indicate liver failure, which could lead to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
3. Pancreatitis: the patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which could lead to pancreatic necrosis and sepsis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: the patient's history of NSTEMI and CHF puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of bacteria in his bloodstream may put him at risk for renal failure.
6. Neurological complications: the patient's altered mental status and history of chronic liver disease may put him at risk for neurological complications, such as encephalopathy and seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue meropenem for sepsis until sensitivities are available.
2. Monitor the patient's LFTs and lipase levels closely to ensure that they are trending down.
3. Continue treatment for CHF and NSTEMI, including metoprolol and aspirin.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely to ensure that it is not deteriorating.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely to ensure that it is not deteriorating.
6. Consider transferring the patient to the floor once his condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Hemoglobin: 10.5-11 g/dL
* Platelet count: 767 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06-0.16 ng/mL
* Glucose: 90-105 mg/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs): Abnormal

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Liver function abnormalities
* Delirium/confusion
* Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
* Hepatitis, chronic viral
* Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic
* Diarrhea
* Acute pain
* Impaired physical mobility

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis progression to septic shock
* Development of organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome)
* Worsening of liver function abnormalities
* Myocardial infarction complications (e.g., cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias)
* Hepatitis exacerbation
* Heart failure decompensation

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative
   Blood cultures pending

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 11108**]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Events: ERCP done yesterday.   PICC line was removed for concern re:
   infection.  Episodes of bradycardia while sleeping, beta blocker held.
   Mental status appears to be improving.
   Tm98.9, P70, SBP87-151.  I/O +2.3.  Sat 94%
   Sleep but arousable, pain in RLE, RRR S1 S2, lungs clear.
   Abd soft, mildly distended, +BS.  No LLE edema, RLE dressing C/D/I.
   On exam distended abdomen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Imaging:
   CXR [**3-5**]: Blunting of left costophrenic angle. No vascular congestion
   and little change
   from prior exam.
   Biliary Tree:
   A mild dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring [**9-17**]
   mm. These findings are compatible with benign papillary stenosis. No
   stones were seen in the CBD. There was no extravasation of contrast
   seen from the cystic duct stump or from any ducts of Luschka. A
   sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. A small amount of biliary
   sludge was extracted from the CBD successfully using a 9-12mm Rx
   balloon catheter.
   Pancreas:
   A mild dilation of approximately 5mm was seen at the distal main
   pancreatic duct. A 4cm by 5FR pancreatic stent was placed successfully
   to aid in biliary cannulation. The plastic pancreatic duct stent was
   removed successfully with a snare.
   Microbiology:
   CDIFF negative
   Blood cultures pending

   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 11108**]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Events: ERCP done yesterday.   PICC line was removed for concern re:
   infection.  Episodes of bradycardia while sleeping, beta blocker held.
   Mental status appears to be improving.
   Tm98.9, P70, SBP87-151.  I/O +2.3.  Sat 94%
   Sleep but arousable, pain in RLE, RRR S1 S2, lungs clear.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of ongoing sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Liver failure: The patient has abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and elevated lipase levels, which may indicate liver damage or failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) and is currently in the ICU due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has a history of chronic viral hepatitis, chronic systolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: temperature 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate 71 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 87/33 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute (bpm), and oxygen saturation 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous pressure (CVP) not assessed, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) not inserted.
* Fluid balance: total fluid input 5,494 mL, total fluid output 3,140 mL, with a balance of 2,354 mL.
* Laboratory results: white blood cell count (WBC) 13.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) 10.5 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) 767 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 22 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) 0.6 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos) elevated.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Liver function abnormalities
* Delirium/confusion
* Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
* Hepatitis, chronic viral
* Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic
* Diarrhea
* Acute pain
* Impaired physical mobility

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: meropenem
* Analgesics: morphine sulfate
* Proton pump inhibitors: pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Anticoagulation: heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Fluid management: IV fluids and blood products as needed
* Respiratory support: oxygen therapy
* Nutrition: NPO (nothing by mouth) with plans for enteral nutrition
* Glycemic control: insulin as needed
* Lines: PICC line and 20-gauge central line

The patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications."

   63M with PVD, EtOH abuse, presented to OSH with septic shock from
   presumed biliary source. Had cholecystectomy and AKA. Now off pressors
   with stable vitals and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for consideration of ERCP
   and further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase.
   # Elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs.
   Improving. s/p lap chole for gangrenous cholecystitis. Rising LFTs
   concerning for retained stone vs leak so transferred here. ERCP without
   stone or leak. Transaminases, lipase, amylase trending down. ERCP c/w
   benign papillary stenosis. Now s/p sphincterotomy. Also hepC ab
   positive, though unlikely acute hepatitis. Patient with baseline EtOH
   abuse and fatty liver, no cirrhosis/portal hypertension or synthetic
   dysfunction evident.
   - Advance diet to clears
   - ERCP recs: still likely post-op illeus, cont IVF
   - cont trend LFTs, amylase/lipase
   # Sepsis

   - continue meropenem for now until we receive OSH sensitivities, plan
   to treat 2wks from last psoitive culture
   - f/u cultures and PICC tip cultures
   # Altered mental status/neuro deficits.
   Mental status continues to improve. TSH and B12 levels normal
   - cont to monitor, reorient
   - cont lactulose (to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia)
   # NSTEMI.
   Patient had elevated trops (and CKs) in setting of hypotension/sepsis,
   however patient has history of severe PVD (and thus likely CAD) and may
   have had more classic thrombotic infarct.  Will need Plavix, allergic
   rxn to aspirin is heartburn, pt needs aspirin for recent arterial
   thrombosis and NSTEMI.
   - START aspirin 325mg PO Daily
   - Continue plavix
   - Now on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID
   - continue holding statin for now due to transamintis.
   - likely will need f/u echo as outpatient
   # CHF, chronic , systolic, EF 25-[**6-6**] have been in setting of NSTEMI. Has been tolerating fluids well.
   - on beta blocker
   - consider ACE
   - Sodium restricted diet once advanced

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ethanol abuse, and chronic viral hepatitis, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of septic shock, pancreatitis, and biliary sepsis. He had undergone a cholecystectomy and arterial bypass grafting (AKA) at an outside hospital. The patient was transferred to the ICU for consideration of ERCP and further management of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. His physical examination reveals a pleasant, chronically ill-appearing man with a soft, non-tender abdomen and a clean, intact AKA site.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lipase and abnormal LFTs, which are trending down. His blood cultures are pending, but he has a history of E. coli sepsis. He is receiving meropenem for treatment of sepsis and has a PICC line in place.

The patient's medical history includes a history of NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure, and chronic viral hepatitis. He is taking plavix and metoprolol for management of his cardiovascular conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and he may require further antibiotics and treatment.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as necrosis, abscesses, or fistulas.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or liver failure.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen, leading to complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may worsen, leading to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or malnutrition.
6. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration risk is high, and he may require close monitoring and treatment for respiratory failure.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to complications such as bleeding or petechiae.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased exercise tolerance.
9. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen, leading to complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or cardiac arrest.
10. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as liver failure, encephalopathy, or death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for sepsis and pancreatitis.
2. Monitor liver function tests and lipase levels closely.
3. Continue metoprolol and plavix for cardiovascular management.
4. Consider ACE inhibitors for heart failure management.
5. Monitor for signs of aspiration and respiratory failure.
6. Monitor for signs of bleeding or petechiae.
7. Consider transfusion of blood products if necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of anemia, such as fatigue or shortness of breath.
9. Consider treatment for COPD exacerbation if necessary.
10. Monitor for signs of worsening hepatitis, such as liver failure or encephalopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), EtOH abuse, and polysubstance abuse, was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He had undergone cholecystectomy and arteriovenous fistula (AKA) creation. His laboratory results showed elevated lipase and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), indicating possible retained stone or leak. An ERCP was performed, which revealed benign papillary stenosis, and a sphincterotomy was performed. The patient was also found to be positive for hepatitis C (HCV) virus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: temperature 36.2°C, heart rate 66 bpm, blood pressure 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.9 K/μL, Hct 32.4%, Plt 95 K/μL, Cr 0.5 mg/dL, Trop-T 0.16 ng/mL, and Glucose 96 mg/dL.
* Imaging: CXR shows a new band of atelectasis in the lingula, mild cardiomegaly, and minimal pleural effusion.
* Microbiology: CATHETER TIP-IV WOUND CULTURE-PENDING, INPATIENT; BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING INPATIENT; IMMUNOLOGY HCV VIRAL LOAD-PENDING INPATIENT; STOOL FECAL CULTURE-PENDING; CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE-PENDING; CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST-FINAL INPATIENT - NEGATIVE.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is still receiving meropenem for sepsis, and cultures are pending. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent sepsis-related complications.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of severe PVD and may have had a more classic thrombotic infarct. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent NSTEMI-related complications.
3. CHF, chronic, systolic: The patient has a history of CHF, and his EF is 25%. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent CHF-related complications.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient is positive for HCV virus, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent hepatitis C-related complications.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent anemia-related complications.
7. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a history of thrombocytosis, and further monitoring is necessary to prevent thrombotic complications.
8. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent COPD-related complications.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue meropenem for sepsis until cultures are negative.
* Continue Plavix for PVD.
* Continue metoprolol for NSTEMI.
* Monitor and treat LFTs, amylase, and lipase.
* Continue lactulose to prevent intestinal bacteria from creating ammonia.
* Consider ACE inhibitor for CHF.
* Monitor and treat diarrhea.
* Monitor and treat hepatitis C.
* Monitor and treat anemia.
* Monitor and treat thrombocytosis.
* Monitor and treat COPD.
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis.
* Continue to monitor and treat other medical conditions as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for sepsis, pancreatitis, and biliary sepsis following an ERCP procedure. He has a history of aspirin allergy and is currently taking plavix for PVD. He is also receiving meropenem for E. coli sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy, and his SpO2 is 95%.

The patient has a PICC line in place, which was called out due to pain at the site. He is also receiving heparin prophylaxis and morphine for pain control.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, liver enzymes, and troponin-T, indicating possible sepsis and pancreatitis. His blood cultures are pending, and his stool culture is negative for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B.

The patient has a history of chronic viral hepatitis, heart failure, and chronic systolic heart failure. He is also at risk for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP due to his medical conditions and ICU stay.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, liver enzymes, and troponin-T levels suggest ongoing sepsis. Continued monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid management are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of his abdominal pain, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary to prevent complications such as necrosis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
3. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic systolic heart failure and elevated troponin-T levels suggest a high risk of heart failure exacerbation. Close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and echocardiogram is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. DVT: The patient's history of chronic viral hepatitis and heart failure increases his risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings, heparin, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be implemented to prevent DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's ICU stay and history of chronic heart failure increase his risk of stress ulcer. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 blockers should be administered to prevent stress ulcer.
6. VAP: The patient's ICU stay and history of chronic heart failure increase his risk of VAP. Endotracheal suctioning, proper hand hygiene, and use of sterile equipment should be implemented to prevent VAP.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure his optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of PVD, EtOH abuse, and chronic viral hepatitis who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock from a presumed biliary source. He underwent cholecystectomy and AKA, and was transferred to the ICU for further management of abnormal LFTs and lipase. The patient has a history of NSTEMI, CHF, and polysubstance abuse.

The patient's current status is:

* Hemodynamically stable with stable vitals
* Improving mental status
* Abnormal LFTs and lipase trending down
* ERCP showed benign papillary stenosis
* Hepatitis C antibody positive, likely from history of polysubstance abuse
* Thrombocytosis likely reactive secondary to recent surgery or inflammation

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and is still receiving meropenem. He is at risk for developing sepsis again, especially with the ongoing infection and potential for retained stone or leak.
* NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is currently on metoprolol and plavix. He is at risk for developing further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* CHF: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure and is at risk for further decompensation, especially with the ongoing infection and potential for fluid overload.
