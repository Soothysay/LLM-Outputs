   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was transferred to the ICU from the hematology/oncology unit due to recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's white blood cell count is 87, which is decreasing after treatment with Gleevec. She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is currently on metoprolol 25mg PO BID. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. She is also experiencing nausea and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's VT is likely due to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be corrected immediately. If not addressed, the patient may experience further episodes of VT, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's CML may cause tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, including VT.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to chemotherapy may increase her risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Cardiac Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to her electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's CKD may worsen due to her electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to acute kidney injury.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to respiratory failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias may lead to neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat.
2. Recheck K and tumor lysis labs.
3. Check TSH.
4. Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily.
5. Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID.
6. Hold diuresis for now.
7. Monitor Cr.
8. Consider restarting dofetilide, but consult with EP first.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and cardiac rhythm closely.
10. Consult with EP and hematology/oncology teams to optimize the patient's care."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a transfer from another hospital for ventricular tachycardia (VTach). The patient has had two episodes of VTach, with the second episode requiring three override pace attempts to revert to sinus rhythm. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone infusions and has a 1st-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient has a history of multiple medications, including antihypertensives, statins, and antidepressants, which may interact with each other or with the amiodarone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and mild hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 40 IU/L and an AST of 41 IU/L.

Potential medical complications to consider:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of VTach and current use of amiodarone infusions make it essential to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm closely for any signs of arrhythmia.
2. Medication interactions: The patient's complex medication regimen may lead to interactions that affect the efficacy or safety of the medications, including the potential for adverse effects such as hypotension or arrhythmias.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased exercise tolerance.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's mild hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or respiratory depression.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or disease, which could lead to complications such as jaundice, coagulopathy, or hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Infection: The patient's lack of recent imaging studies and microbiology results raises concern for potential infections, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm, vital signs, and laboratory results closely, and to adjust the patient's medication regimen and treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES
   want her daughter notified regarding this current hospital admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of ventricular tachycardia, which is likely caused by hypokalemia and diuresis with lasix.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Potassium: 3.3 mmol/L (hypokalemia)
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL (hypomagnesemia)
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mEq/L (normal)
* Glucose: 73 mg/dL (normal)
* White blood cell count: 86.9 K/uL (normal)
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL (normal)
* Platelet count: 133 K/uL (normal)

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (normal)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (normal)
* Blood pressure: 116/51 mmHg (normal)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (normal)
* Oxygen saturation: 94% (normal)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* No peripheral vascular pulses assessed
* No skin lesions assessed
* Responds to stimuli, but no movement, tone, or reflexes assessed
* Neurologic examination not performed

The patient's medical history includes:

* Cancer (malignant neoplasm)
* Chronic systolic heart failure
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus
* Chronic kidney disease
* Coronary artery disease
* Atrial fibrillation
* Ventricular tachycardia
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's medications include:

* Amiodarone
* Metoprolol
* Lasix
* Gleevec
* Prochlorperazine
* Zofran
* Allopurinol
* Synthroid
* Glargine
* Aspirin

The patient's plan includes:

* Correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
* Recheck of potassium and tumor lysis labs
* Check TSH
* Consider restarting dofetilide
* Monitor creatinine
* Continue metoprolol
* Continue Gleevec
* Continue allopurinol
* Continue synthroid
* Continue glargine
* Continue aspirin

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, meaning do not resuscitate/do not intubate, and the ICD is to remain active.

The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for further management of her ventricular tachycardia and other medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and hypokalemia. She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AFib) and flutter, and has been taking Gleevec for her CML. The patient's white blood cell count is 87, which is coming down after Gleevec treatment. She has chronic systolic heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's VT is likely due to hypokalemia, which needs to be corrected stat. Discontinuation of dofetilide may also be contributing to the VT.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Although less likely, TLS could be causing the patient's cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitoring of tumor lysis labs and re-checking potassium levels is necessary.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia need to be corrected to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Cardiac Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen if not managed properly. Diuresis may need to be restarted, and the patient's medication regimen reviewed.
5. Infection: The patient's CKD and cancer diagnosis make her more susceptible to infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is crucial.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's DNR/DNI status and ICD shocks may lead to hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac rhythm is necessary to prevent complications.
7. Medication Interactions: The patient's medication regimen is complex, and interactions between medications may occur. Close monitoring of medication side effects and adjustments to the regimen as needed are necessary.
8. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional needs should be assessed and addressed to prevent malnutrition and related complications.

Recommendations:

1. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat.
2. Re-check potassium and tumor lysis labs.
3. Check TSH levels.
4. Continue Gleevec 400mg PO daily.
5. Monitor Cr levels and consider restarting dofetilide.
6. Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID.
7. Hold Irbesartan 75 mg PO daily.
8. Clarify with hem/onc why Coumadin is being held.
9. Continue cardiac/diabetic diet and monitor for signs of infection.
10. Notify the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) 3353**], regarding the current hospital admission."

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Thought to be from hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. However, pt continued to have v tach
   with stable potassium level.  Discontinuation of dofetalide may also be
   contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which
   is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less likely in
   the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal phosphate.
   Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible, however TSH was normal.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately. Patient had another episode last night of
   slow v tach that was not paced out by her PM and required amiodarone +
   lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Thought to be from hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. However, pt continued to have v tach
   with stable potassium level.  Discontinuation of dofetalide may also be
   contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which
   is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less likely in
   the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal phosphate.
   Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible, however TSH was normal.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately. Patient had another episode last night of
   slow v tach that was not paced out by her PM and required amiodarone +
   lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues. TSH normal.
   - Continue synthroid
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on dofetilide, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML) on Gleevec, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and vertigo and vomiting.

The patient's current condition is ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a history of slow VT that was not paced out by her pacemaker and required amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient's electrolytes are being closely monitored, and she is receiving continuous telemetry.

The patient's medical history is significant for CML, which is being treated with Gleevec at a reduced dose of 300mg PO daily. The patient's white count is coming down after Gleevec, but she is not a good candidate for dasatinib due to QT prolongation.

The patient's other medical conditions include chronic systolic heart failure, Afib/AFlutter, CKD, CAD, DM, hypothyroidism, and FEN. She is taking various medications, including metoprolol, Irbesartan, coumadin, and ASA.

The patient's goals of care are to continue Gleevec at a reduced dose, continue metoprolol, and hold Irbesartan. She is DNR/DNI and does not want any external interventions beyond shocks, CPR, or intubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Cardiac tamponade, which can occur due to the patient's pacemaker malfunction.
3. Hypokalemia, which can exacerbate the patient's VT and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Tumor lysis syndrome, which can occur due to the patient's CML and lead to cardiac dysrhythmias.
5. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, which can occur due to the patient's thyroid medication and lead to cardiac dysrhythmias.
6. Ischemia/hypoxia/infection, which can exacerbate the patient's VT and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate the patient's VT and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Monitoring of electrolytes and correction of any imbalances.
2. Continuous telemetry to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm.
3. Amiodarone and lidocaine to treat VT.
4. Gleevec at a reduced dose to treat CML.
5. Metoprolol to treat chronic systolic heart failure.
6. Coumadin to treat Afib/AFlutter.
7. ASA to prevent cardiac events.
8. Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
9. Pain management with acetaminophen.
10. Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN.

The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy and has been notified of the patient's current hospital admission."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sustained ventricular tachycardia. He has a history of cancer and is taking multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and statins. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's respiratory support is limited to oxygen therapy, and he is not requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL. His platelet count is within normal limits, and his liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT level of 44 IU/L and an AST level of 37 IU/L. His kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his unstable cardiac condition, and his neurologic examination is also incomplete. The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's sustained ventricular tachycardia is a serious condition that requires close monitoring and management. There is a risk of cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or sudden death.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of an unstable cardiac condition.
3. Infection complications: The patient's impaired immune function due to cancer and chemotherapy increases the risk of infection, particularly respiratory and bloodstream infections.
4. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and impaired liver function may lead to malnutrition and impaired wound healing.
5. Renal complications: The patient's impaired kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's incomplete neurologic examination may indicate underlying neurologic damage or dysfunction, which could worsen with time.
7. Hematologic complications: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding or hemorrhagic complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's impaired liver function and anemia may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, malnutrition, or impaired wound healing."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES
   want her daughter notified regarding this current hospital admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on dofetilide, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on Gleevec, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. She initially presented to the hospital with vertigo and vomiting and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 85-126 bpm, blood pressure 103/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 86.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, platelet count 136 x 10^9/L, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL.
* Electrolyte levels: Potassium 3.6 mEq/L, magnesium 2.6 mEq/L, and calcium 8.8 mg/dL.
* Cardiac rhythm: First-degree atrioventricular block with ventricular tachycardia.
* Medications: Amiodarone, lidocaine, metoprolol, and Gleevec.

The patient's medical history and current condition suggest several potential medical complications that could arise, including:

1. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's CML may lead to tumor lysis syndrome, which can cause cardiac dysrhythmias, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is low, which can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is low, which can also contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's CKD may progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular complications.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's type 2 diabetes may worsen, leading to hyperglycemia and complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD may progress, leading to myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's Afib may worsen, leading to cardiac failure or stroke.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which means that she does not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or other life-sustaining interventions if she becomes unstable."

   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately.
   Patient received large dose of amiodarone and on lidocaine gtt after

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately.
   Patient received large dose of amiodarone and on lidocaine gtt after
   episode
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on dofetilide, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on Gleevec, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypothyroidism. She was initially admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting and was later transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT). She has had multiple episodes of VT, including one that required lidocaine and amiodarone treatment. Her electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and she is receiving daily tumor lysis labs. She has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) order, and her daughter is her healthcare proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's CML may lead to tumor lysis syndrome, which can cause electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib and VT, as well as her current treatment with dofetilide and amiodarone, may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, but she may still experience imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to her CML and chemotherapy may increase her risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's CKD and anticoagulation therapy with warfarin may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's CKD and anticoagulation therapy with warfarin may also increase her risk of thrombosis.
7. Cardiac Failure: The patient's cardiac condition and treatment with dofetilide and amiodarone may increase her risk of cardiac failure.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, but she may still experience respiratory failure, particularly if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent and treat any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - daily INR
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Dysuria:
   - D/C foley and use bedside commode
   - UA and culture
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy

   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on dofetilide, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on Gleevec, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and previously untreated CML.

The patient was admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting, and later transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient had two episodes of VT, the second one occurring despite relatively normalized potassium levels, making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less likely. The patient was given a large dose of amiodarone and was manually overpaced by the EP fellow.

The patient has the following medical complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had two episodes of VT, and the etiology is unclear. The patient has been given amiodarone and lidocaine, and is being monitored for electrolyte abnormalities.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears slightly hypervolemic and has been given diuretics to manage fluid overload.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stable CKD and is being monitored for changes in creatinine levels.
4. CML: The patient has CML and is being treated with Gleevec at a reduced dose of 300mg PO daily.
5. Dysuria: The patient has dysuria and a Foley catheter has been discontinued.
6. CAD: The patient has CAD and is being managed with ASA and statin therapy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall individual with a history of cancer, who was transferred to the ICU for ventricular tachycardia (VTach). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg. The patient is receiving Coumadin (Warfarin) and has a first-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 117 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. The urinalysis showed WBCs, and the patient was started on ceftriaxone. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The patient's diagnosis includes constipation, urinary tract infection (UTI), ventricular tachycardia, and cancer. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated WBC count and UTI diagnosis, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VTach and first-degree atrioventricular block may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's constipation and UTI diagnosis may increase the risk of developing further infections.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium level may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's constipation may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's cancer diagnosis may lead to further complications and progression of the disease.

Based on the provided information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications early on and initiate appropriate interventions to prevent or manage them."

 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
 have been stable
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - daily INR
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Dysuria:
   - Ceftriaxone
   - D/C foley and use bedside commode

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cancer (CML), chronic systolic heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. She was initially admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting, and was transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VTach). The patient's VTach is ongoing, despite normalization of potassium levels, and is unclear in etiology. She has also been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) and constipation.

The patient has a complex medical history, including a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) on dofetilide, which was initially held due to renal failure. She has also been taking Gleevec for CML, but not consistently. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, including hypokalemia, and her creatinine levels are elevated.

The patient's goals of care have been clarified, and she is DNR/DNI, but willing to receive ICD shocks. She is also willing to receive antidiabetic and cardiac medications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VTach is ongoing, and there is a risk of further episodes, which could lead to cardiac arrest or death.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a UTI, which could lead to sepsis, pyelonephritis, or other complications if not properly treated.
3. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which could lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or other complications if not properly managed.
4. Cancer progression: The patient has CML, which could progress and lead to further complications, such as bone marrow failure, anemia, or bleeding.
5. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has hypokalemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications if not properly managed.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which could lead to further kidney damage, acidosis, or other complications if not properly managed.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which could lead to fatigue, weight gain, or other complications if not properly managed.
8. Cardiac failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which could lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or death.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as ongoing communication with the patient and her daughter regarding her treatment plan and goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stopped lidocaine gtt yesterday
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation

   - BMT recs

   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Restart lasix 40mg PO Daily
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, who was transferred to the ICU for management of a sustained ventricular tachycardia episode. She has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She is currently receiving treatment for cancer (chronic myeloid leukemia) with Gleevec, but not taking it as prescribed. She has also been experiencing constipation, urinary tract infection, and dysuria.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for trace edema in her extremities. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and mild liver enzyme elevation.

The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet, Lisinopril, Zetia, Lipitor, Doxepin, Boniva, and Ciprofloxacin. She is currently receiving various medications, including amiodarone, lidocaine, metoprolol, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's sustained ventricular tachycardia episode is a significant concern, and further management is needed to prevent future episodes.
2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's urine culture is pending, and further treatment may be necessary to prevent complications.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decompensation and further complications.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as end-stage renal disease.
6. Cancer (CML): The patient's cancer treatment with Gleevec may need to be adjusted to prevent further complications.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
8. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of her body if not properly managed, leading to further complications.
9. DNR/DNI Status: The patient's DNR/DNI status may need to be readdressed as her condition deteriorates, and further discussion with her daughter and healthcare providers may be necessary."
