   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.
   - C-[**Doctor First Name 458**] evaluation for CABG, but likely will be > 7 days away.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start ACE-I and bblocker once BP and HR tolerate
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   - resume coumadin as will need bacteremia fully treated prior to
   surgery.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct. Will not exclude pulmonary
   source of infection given chills and leukocytosis and large A-a
   gradient.  Patient is hypertensive at baseline on metoprolol 150 mg PO
   BID, Losartan 100 mg DAILY, Amlodipine 10 mg, Minoxidil 10 mg PO QAM,
   and Lisinopril 40 mg DAILY at home.  Hypotensive s/p 1.9 L IVF
   removal.  Likely with diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency.
   Given bacteremia, may need generous IVF resuscitation.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - Will support blood pressure with IVF
   - Wean neosynepherin
   - Hold blood pressure lowering medications for now
   RHYTHM: NSR currently, but had 2 episodes of SVT associated with
   hypotension to SBPs of 60.  The episode started with APB, had
   prolonging PR intervals and ended with an atrial pause, with HR around
   150.  Ddx includes A-tach and AVNRT.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient intubated in for acute
   respiratory distress.  Has high FiO2 requirement and large A-a
   gradient.  CXR shows volume overload and possible developing
   infiltrate.
   - Abx with vanc and zosyn for HAP coverage.  Follow sputum culture
   - Fluid goal even, may need to diurese to compensate for obligate IVF.
   - daily CXR
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, consider increasing PEEP if pressure
   tolerates.
   BACTEREMIA: Chills during HD and low grade temp, along with elevated
   WBC and left count.  Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from
   indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   - Zosyn to meropenem if worsening for ESBL coverage.  No h/o pip-tazo
   resistance
   - will attempt to treat through bacteremia, but may need to pull line
   if GNR are pseudomonas or other difficult organisms.
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - restart coumadin with goal [**2-6**], currently subtheraputic, bridge with
   heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  NPO, HD today, TF consult
   ACCESS: Peripheral EJ IV and one peripheral IV, HD line, will likely
   need central access.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Abx with vanc and zosyn for HAP coverage.  Follow sputum culture
   - Fluid goal even, may need to diurese to compensate for obligate IVF.
   - daily CXR
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, consider increasing PEEP if pressure
   tolerates.
   BACTEREMIA: Chills during HD and low grade temp, along with elevated
   WBC and left count.  Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from
   indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   - Zosyn to meropenem if worsening for ESBL coverage.  No h/o pip-tazo
   resistance
   - will attempt to treat through bacteremia, but may need to pull line
   if GNR are pseudomonas or other difficult organisms.
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a significant medical history, including diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), pulmonary edema, and bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: He has demand ischemia, with severe flow-limiting lesions on cardiac catheterization, which are not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and are likely to require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
* Respiratory: He has pulmonary edema, with a large A-a gradient, and is intubated on a ventilator with a high FiO2 requirement.
* Hemodynamic: He is hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 101/32 mmHg, and has a heart rate of 64 bpm.
* Renal: He has end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and is currently receiving treatment.
* Infectious: He has bacteremia, with GNR (gram-negative rods) in his blood cultures, and is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Heart failure due to demand ischemia and pulmonary edema
	+ Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	+ Pneumonia
	+ Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression
* Infectious complications:
	+ Sepsis
	+ Organ failure
	+ Meningitis
* Metabolic complications:
	+ Hyperglycemia
	+ Hypocalcemia
	+ Hypophosphatemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Cardiac catheterization to assess the severity of his coronary artery disease
* Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to treat his demand ischemia
* Pulmonary edema treatment with diuretics and vasodilators
* Bacteremia treatment with antibiotics and source control measures
* Renal support with hemodialysis and fluid management
* Tight glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is critical care unit (CCU)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start bblocker
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - consider adding BB
   RHYTHM: NSR currently
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved.  Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate
   normal

   ESRD on HD:

   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start bblocker
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - consider adding BB
   RHYTHM: NSR currently
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved.  Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate
   normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - continue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presents with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), pulmonary edema, and bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving 50% FiO2, with a CXR showing volume overload and possible developing infiltrate.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, likely secondary to pneumonia, with possible sources including pulmonary and skin from the indwelling HD line. The HD line is being kept in place.
3. Coronaries: The patient has demand ischemia, with severe flow-limiting lesions on cath that are not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and will likely require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
4. Pump: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely secondary to acute infarct, with an echocardiogram showing normal ejection fraction, interatrial aneurysm, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
5. Rhythm: The patient's current rhythm is normal sinus rhythm (NSR), with a plan to continue monitoring on telemetry and add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates.
6. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis has resolved, likely secondary to uremia.
7. ESRD on HD: The patient is on HD, with a goal of even fluid balance and monitoring of electrolytes.
8. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with tight glucose control, with the goal of avoiding hypoglycemia.
9. History of stroke: The patient has no residual deficits from his previous stroke, and is taking coumadin at home.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and underlying medical conditions increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's demand ischemia and coronary artery disease increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and underlying medical conditions increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury or worsening of his renal function.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and underlying medical conditions increase his risk of developing additional infections.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including bacteremia, demand ischemia, pulmonary edema, and ESRD on HD. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.
   - C-[**Doctor First Name 458**] evaluation for CABG, but likely will be > 7 days away.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start ACE-I and bblocker once BP and HR tolerate
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   - resume coumadin as will need bacteremia fully treated prior to
   surgery.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present.
   Likely with diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency.  Given
   bacteremia, may need generous IVF resuscitation.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - Will support blood pressure with IVF
   - Wean neosynepherin
   - Hold blood pressure lowering medications for now
   RHYTHM: NSR currently, but had 2 episodes of SVT associated with
   hypotension to SBPs of 60.  The episode started with APB, had
   prolonging PR intervals and ended with an atrial pause, with HR around
   150.  Ddx includes A-tach and AVNRT.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - continue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  NPO, HD today, TF consult
   ACCESS: Peripheral EJ IV and one peripheral IV, HD line, will likely
   need central access.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), chronic vascular disease, hypertension, and a previous stroke. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. He has a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 140 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 101/32 mmHg. He has a 2+ peripheral edema and a history of chronic vascular disease.
* Neurological: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 and is able to follow commands. He has no focal neurological deficits.
* Renal: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. His creatinine level is 4.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23 mg/dL.
* Infectious: The patient has a GNR bacteremia and is being treated with Zosyn. He also has a possible pneumonia and is at risk for sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of chronic vascular disease and a recent NSTEMI, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis, and there is a risk of further renal deterioration or complications related to hemodialysis.
* Infectious complications: The patient has a GNR bacteremia and is at risk for further infectious complications, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of stroke and is at risk for further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures.

In summary, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical condition who is at risk for multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line. GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start bblocker
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - consider adding BB
   RHYTHM: NSR currently
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved.  Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate

   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving 50% FiO2 due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A chest X-ray (CXR) shows volume overload and possible developing infiltrate.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a likely secondary bacteremia due to pneumonia, with chills during HD and low-grade temperature, elevated white blood cell (WBC) and left count. Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from the indwelling HD line. The bacteremia is being treated with Zosyn, and daily blood cultures are being performed.
3. Coronaries: The patient has demand ischemia, and the original diagnosis of NSTEMI was revised to demand ischemia due to the presence of bacteremia. The patient has severe flow-limiting lesions that are not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and will likely require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
4. Pumps: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely causing shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxemia. An echocardiogram (Echo) shows normal ejection fraction (EF), interatrial aneurysm, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
5. Anion gap acidosis: The patient had anion gap acidosis, which has resolved likely due to uremia.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient is on HD, and the goal is to maintain even levels.
7. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, and tight glucose control is being aimed for due to the sepsis picture.
8. History of stroke: The patient has no residual deficits and is taking coumadin at home.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's demand ischemia and potential need for CABG may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD on HD may worsen, leading to further renal failure.
5. Infections: The patient's indwelling HD line and other medical devices may increase the risk of infections.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further treatment, such as blood transfusions.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes may lead to hyperglycemia, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   Patient needs to have the dialysis line removed as she is not
   clinically improving, will have dialysis today to take off more fluid
   as pt will lose line, unclear if another one is going to be placed
   now.  Will hold BB and then reinstate as needed.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Improving ABG.  Currently on pressure
   support with 40%FiO2.  ABG shows improvement in pO2, patient is
   candidate for extubation today.
   - Extubate today.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  GNR in blood cultures,
   Pantoea spp, no MICs available.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to
   pneumonia or is a contaminant.  Renal recommends removing the dialysis
   catheter as WBC and fever curve is not improving.  Will dialyse today
   before removal of line.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin
   - restart bblocker when stable.
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   Patient needs to have the dialysis line removed as she is not
   clinically improving, will have dialysis today to take off more fluid
   as pt will lose line, unclear if another one is going to be placed
   now.  Will hold BB and then reinstate as needed.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Improving ABG.  Currently on pressure
   support with 40%FiO2.  ABG shows improvement in pO2, patient is
   candidate for extubation today.
   - Extubate today.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  GNR in blood cultures,
   Pantoea spp, no MICs available.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to
   pneumonia or is a contaminant.  Renal recommends removing the dialysis
   catheter as WBC and fever curve is not improving.  Will dialyse today
   before removal of line.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin
   - restart bblocker when stable.
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.  INT 2.4 today.
   - discontinue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She was admitted with a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and bacteremia caused by a rare genus of bacteria, Pantoea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99%, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows improvement in partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) and pH.
* Cardiovascular: She has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, likely secondary to acute infarct. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows normal left ventricular function, but with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal septum, and apex.
* Hemodynamic: Her blood pressure is 132/44 mmHg, and her heart rate is 71 beats per minute.
* Laboratory: Her white blood cell count is 21.3 x 10^9/L, and her blood cultures are positive for Pantoea spp. Her troponin-T level is 3.40 ng/mL, and her creatine kinase (CK) level is 56 IU/L.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is likely secondary to pneumonia, and the causative organism is Pantoea spp. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and her fever curve is not improving, indicating a possible infection.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is likely secondary to acute infarct, and her oxygen saturation is 99%, indicating adequate oxygenation.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's cardiac ischemia is likely secondary to demand ischemia, given her bacteremia and the severity of her coronary lesions. Her troponin-T level is elevated, indicating myocardial damage.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD is likely worsening, given her elevated creatinine level and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
5. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and death.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy with Zosyn for HAP coverage.
2. Daily blood cultures to monitor for bacterial growth.
3. Removal of the dialysis catheter, as recommended by the renal team.
4. Dialysis today to remove excess fluid and improve the patient's condition.
5. Continued monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, including echocardiography and cardiac enzymes.
6. Consideration of cardiac catheterization and possible coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
7. Management of the patient's diabetes, including tight glucose control and insulin therapy.
8. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
9. Continued prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

         CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
CXR: Improved bibasilar atelectasis with persistent small left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA:  Pantoea spp in multiple cultures, likely a line-associated
   infection.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to pneumonia.  Renal
   recommends removing the dialysis catheter as WBC and fever curve is not
   improving.
   - Plan to have line holiday over weekend and replace line on Monday.
   - Cont Meropenem for 2 week course, will need PICC placed as well.
   - blood cultures today for surveilence.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - Increasing hypotension with resolution of sepsis.  Will uptitrate BB
   as necessary and add back ACE.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Marked improvement in resp status
   following Abx and diuresis, now -1L for LOS.  Patient extubated without
   difficulties.
   - Continue meropenem for PNA coverage
   - Avoid excessive volume overload
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin, beta-blocker, ACE
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.  INT > 2
   - no heparin for now

   - continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presents with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Marked improvement in respiratory status following antibiotic therapy and diuresis. He is extubated without difficulty.
* Cardiovascular: Appears to have demand ischemia given infection. Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin levels, but catheterization revealed severe flow-limiting lesions that are chronic and not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is likely needed.
* Renal: ESRD on HD. Renal recommendations include removing the dialysis catheter as the white blood cell count and fever curve are not improving.
* Infectious: GNR bacteremia, likely line-associated infection. Pantoea spp. was cultured from multiple blood cultures, and the patient has been prescribed meropenem for a 2-week course.
* Neurological: No residual deficits from CVA.
* Endocrine: Hypothyroidism, treated with levothyroxine.
* Gastrointestinal: Diabetic diet, HD on Monday.
* Medications: Multiple medications are being administered, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and thyroid hormone replacement.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of GNR bacteremia, which may lead to pneumonia.
2. Line-associated infection: The patient has a mid-line and dialysis catheter, which may become infected.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has demand ischemia, and CABG may be necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has marked improvement in respiratory status, but may still be at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on HD, and removal of the dialysis catheter may lead to complications.
6. Infection: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may lead to complications if not properly managed.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes, which may lead to hyperglycemia if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue meropenem for 2 weeks to treat GNR bacteremia.
2. Remove the dialysis catheter and replace it with a new one.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and provide supportive care as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Manage the patient's hypothyroidism with levothyroxine.
8. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and provide supportive care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

CXR: Improved bibasilar atelectasis with persistent small left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA:  Pantoea spp in multiple cultures, likely a line-associated
   infection.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to pneumonia.  Renal
   recommends removing the dialysis catheter as WBC and fever curve is not
   improving.
   - Plan to have line holiday over weekend and replace line on Monday.
   - Cont Meropenem for 2 week course, will need PICC placed as well.
   - daily blood cultures.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Marked improvement in resp status
   following Abx and diuresis, now even for LOS.  Patient extubated
   without difficulties.
   - Continue meropenem for PNA coverage
   - Avoid excessive volume overload
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin
   - restart bblocker when stable.
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.  INT 2.4 today.
   - discontinue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema, and was found to have bacteremia caused by Pantoea spp., likely related to a line-associated infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Marked improvement in respiratory status following antibiotic therapy and diuresis, with continued oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
* Cardiovascular: Demand ischemia is suspected, and the patient is at risk for further cardiac complications.
* Renal: The patient is on HD and has a dialysis catheter, which is planned to be removed and replaced with a PICC line.
* Infectious disease: The patient has bacteremia caused by Pantoea spp., and is receiving meropenem therapy.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of stroke and is on warfarin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's demand ischemia and suspected coronary artery disease, cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias are possible.
2. Infection-related complications: The patient's bacteremia and line-associated infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or other infection-related complications.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema and bacteremia may lead to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or other respiratory complications.
4. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and HD therapy may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or other renal complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of stroke and bacteremia may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, encephalopathy, or stroke.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued meropenem therapy for 2 weeks.
2. Removal and replacement of the dialysis catheter with a PICC line.
3. Daily blood cultures and monitoring of the patient's bacteremia.
4. Cardiovascular medications, including aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
5. Renal dialysis and monitoring of the patient's renal function.
6. Tight glycemic control and management of the patient's diabetes.
7. Monitoring of the patient's neurological status and management of any neurological complications.
8. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."
