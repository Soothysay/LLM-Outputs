   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who was admitted to the MICU for management of hypotension, acute bleed, and hematoma. He has a left intertrochanteric fracture and is scheduled for total hip replacement. The patient has a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, chronic venous stasis, and recurrent C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension and decreased Hct may indicate hypovolemia, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
2. Acute Bleed: The patient's hematoma and decreased Hct may indicate an acute bleed, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CHF, AFib, and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's history of recurrent C. difficile infection and his current hypotension and hematoma may increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if not addressed promptly.
6. Chronic Venous Stasis: The patient's chronic venous stasis may increase the risk of wound complications, particularly if not addressed promptly.
7. Chronic Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen if not addressed promptly, particularly if it is secondary to CKD or chronic disease.
8. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency and his current hypotension may increase the risk of adrenal crisis.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and his current hypotension and hematoma may increase the risk of pneumonia.
10. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current hypotension and hematoma may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and Hct closely to address hypovolemia and acute bleed.
2. Consider transfusing the patient with blood products to address anemia and thrombocytopenia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust antibiotics as necessary to prevent infection.
5. Consider consulting a cardiologist to address the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Consider consulting a nephrologist to address the patient's chronic kidney disease and adjust medications as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's wound status and adjust wound care as necessary to prevent wound complications.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to address the patient's chronic anemia and adjust medications as necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's adrenal status and adjust medications as necessary to prevent adrenal crisis.
10. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to address the patient's pneumonia risk and adjust medications as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole, for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass, or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl. MRI abdomen, non-urgent
* Chronic anemia: Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic disease. Consider Epo
* Chronic venous stasis: Wound care for left leg ulcer. Teds
* Inability to take PO meds: Pt somewhat sleepy late last night, and PO meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult speech/swallow.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Hypotension and acute bleed/hematoma may lead to shock, cardiac arrest, and multi-organ failure
* Infection may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death
* Thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding, hemorrhage, and organ failure
* Chronic anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased quality of life
* Chronic venous stasis may lead to wound infection, gangrene, and amputation
* Pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death
* C. Diff infection may lead to diarrhea, dehydration, and death
* Adrenal mass may lead to hormonal imbalances, electrolyte disturbances, and organ failure
* Retroperitoneal mass may lead to bleeding, hemorrhage, and organ failure
* CHF may lead to cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and death
* CKD may lead to uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his conditions to prevent potential complications and improve his clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed

   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture.  He was hypotensive to
   the 90s in the ED and was admitted to the MICU for management.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed

   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent

   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient, an 87-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU for management of hypotension, acute bleed, and hematuria. He has a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN. The patient is currently receiving IVF and pRBC transfusions to maintain a stable blood pressure. He has a left intertrochanteric fracture and is awaiting total hip replacement surgery.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/acute bleed/hematoma: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is at risk of developing hypotension, acute bleed, or hematoma, particularly in the setting of his hip fracture.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions. This may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. CKD-stage IV: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is at risk of developing uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload.
4. Possible pneumonia: The patient's initial CXR showed concerning retrocardiac opacity, and he received levofloxacin in the ED. Further evaluation is needed to rule out pneumonia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease. Monitoring and transfusion may be necessary.
6. Recurrent C. Diff infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. Diff infection and is currently on PO Vancomycin taper. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has AFib and is not on Coumadin due to GIB. Rate control with metoprolol may be necessary.
8. Chronic anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely secondary to CKD/chronic disease. Consideration of Epo may be necessary.
9. Chronic venous stasis: The patient has chronic venous stasis, which may require wound care and compression therapy.
10. Inability to take PO meds: The patient is having difficulty taking PO meds, which may require crush meds PRN or consultation with speech/swallow.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Gentle IVF or pRBC transfusions to maintain SBP > 90.
2. Monitoring of physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at the site of fracture.
3. Repeat CXR in the morning to evaluate for pneumonia.
4. Hold ASA for now due to low Hct and possible going to OR.
5. Restart home torsemide dose this morning.
6. Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload.
7. Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
8. ID approval required in the morning.
9. Crush meds PRN if patient is unable to take PO meds.
10. Monitor for signs of complications, such as soft tissue hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, and DVT.

The patient's code status is full code for acute situations and OR, but he does not wish to be chronically ventilated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, was admitted to the ICU for hypotension after falling at his nursing home and being found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent ORIF with TFN. The patient's 24-hour events include invasive ventilation, which was started and stopped, and OR receipt. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 100-130 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and standby ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal response, cardiogenic shock, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hematuria may be due to trauma or a bleeding disorder.
2. Left hip fracture: The patient's left hip fracture may lead to complications such as soft tissue hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, or infection.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's stage IV CKD may lead to complications such as uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be due to hemolysis post-transfusions or underlying kidney disease.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease.
6. Recurrent C. difficile infection: The patient's recurrent C. difficile infection may lead to complications such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dehydration.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
8. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
9. Chronic venous stasis: The patient's chronic venous stasis may lead to complications such as wound care issues and potential infections.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Gentle IVF or PRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg.
3. Hold ASA for now given low Hct.
4. Bumped appropriately after 2 units PRBC night of [**4-6**]; re-transfuse for Hct < 25.
5. Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out retroperitoneal bleed.
6. Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload in setting of CKD.
7. Hold torsemide and spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia.
8. Continue BB, enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24, and morphine for pain.
9. Monitor for signs of pneumonia, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
10. Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
11. ID approval required in AM.
12. Monitor for signs of atrial fibrillation, including irregular pulse and shortness of breath.
13. Consider Epo for chronic anemia.
14. Wound care for left leg ulcer.
15. Crush meds PRN for inability to take PO meds.
16. Replete electrolytes, NPO now for procedure, senna/colace/tums for prophylaxis.
17. Pneumoboots and PPI for prophylaxis."

   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; re-transfuse
   for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - continue torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.2. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - continue torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor

   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr

   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,

   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.2. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - continue torsemide

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents to the MICU for hypotension after falling at his nursing home and sustaining a left intertrochanteric hip fracture. He has been admitted for 1 day and has undergone ORIF with TFN. His current vital signs are:

* T: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* HR: 92 bpm
* BP: 68/39 mmHg
* RR: 14 breaths/min
* SpO2: 97%

He has been receiving various medications, including Enoxaparin, Furosemide, Morphine, and Torsemide, and has had blood products transfused. His laboratory results show:

* Hct: 22.8%
* Plt: 128 K/μL
* Cr: 2.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 25 mmHg
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL

He has been diagnosed with hypotension, acute bleed, and hyperkalemia, and is at risk for septic shock, hypovolemia, vasovagal syncope, cardiogenic shock, and adrenal insufficiency. He is also at risk for complications such as retroperitoneal bleed, soft tissue hematoma, and pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypovolemic shock: due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Septic shock: secondary to a potential infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiogenic shock: due to poor cardiac function and inadequate perfusion.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: secondary to a potential adrenal mass or cortisol deficiency.
5. Retroperitoneal bleed: due to the hip fracture or other underlying conditions.
6. Soft tissue hematoma: secondary to the hip fracture or other underlying conditions.
7. Pneumonia: secondary to aspiration or other underlying conditions.
8. Hyperkalemia: due to hemolysis or other underlying conditions.
9. Chronic venous stasis: secondary to underlying conditions such as CKD.
10. Inability to take PO meds: due to poor oral intake or other underlying conditions.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of hyperkalemic (likely hemolyzed) and was taken to the operating room for ORIF hip fracture with TFN (trochanter femoral nail) on the left. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells for brief SBP 70s on neo (weaned off).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* HR: 92 (68-116) bpm
* BP: 68/39 (50-82/50-61) mmHg
* RR: 14 (11-20) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%
* Heart rhythm: AF (Atrial Fibrillation)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.2-9.5
* Hct: 22.8-32
* Plt: 128-131
* Cr: 2.4-3.2
* TCO2: 25

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
* H/O ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
* H/O PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
* HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
* HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of multiple lines and tubes
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the need for invasive ventilation
* Cardiac arrest due to the patient's hypotension and tachycardia
* Renal failure progression and the need for dialysis
* Infection and sepsis due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of multiple lines and tubes
* Pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and the need for prophylaxis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to the patient's acute pain and the need for analgesia."

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its
   branches.
   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, NPO now for procedure, senna/colace/tums
   # Prophylaxis: No SCH given possible concern for HIT in past. PPI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CT ABDOMEN ([**4-6**]):
   1. Left intertrochanteric hip fracture.
   2. Large left adrenal mass, which is not characterized on non-contrast
   examination. However, the imaging features are not consistent with an
   adrenal
   hematoma. A nonurgent adrenal MR recommended for further
   characterization.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its
   branches.
   5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
   6. Prostatic enlargement.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; retransfuse for
   Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE
   - Ortho following; plan for total hip replacement today (open schedule
   for add-on)
   - Active type and screen; coags in AM, NPO
   - Cardiac consult in early AM to clear for surgery (followed by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3014**]
   - Pneumoboots  (no SCH given prior concern for possible HIT) for DVT
   prophylaxis
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide for now in setting of hypotension
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hypotension
   - Continue BB
   - Hold ASA for now in setting of hypotension and anemia and possibly
   going to OR
   - Continue statin
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   - Goal UOP > 50 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - Re-check EKG this AM
   - Re-check K prior to OR
   - Restart home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending down to 2.4. Likely prerenal in setting of
   hypotension, though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Currently self-diuresing
   well.
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR in AM after hydrated
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   - ID approval required in AM.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a left intertrochanteric hip fracture and a history of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic anemia. He was found to have hypotension in the emergency department and was given one unit of packed red blood cells. He was taken to the operating room for ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation) of the hip fracture, during which he received another unit of packed red blood cells. Post-operatively, he was found to have hyperkalemia, which is likely secondary to hemolysis from the transfusions. He is currently being treated with gentle intravenous fluids and blood products to maintain his blood pressure and volume status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he may require further blood products or other interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may require further treatment to prevent cardiac complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which may require adjustments to his medications and fluid management.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, which may increase his risk of stroke or other cardiovascular complications.
6. Chronic anemia: The patient's anemia may require further treatment with erythropoietin or other medications.
7. Chronic venous stasis: The patient has a history of chronic venous stasis, which may increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or other complications.
8. Recurrent C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection, which may require further treatment with antibiotics or other medications.
9. Inability to take PO meds: The patient may have difficulty taking oral medications due to his age and medical condition, which may require alternative methods of medication administration.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The note highlights the following key points:

1. The patient has a femoral neck fracture, which was surgically repaired via ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation).
2. The patient is at risk for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and is receiving prophylactic measures as per orthopedic recommendations.
3. The patient is experiencing pain, which is being managed with adequate pain control.
4. The patient's left shoulder is tender and exhibits discomfort on passive abduction, suggesting the possibility of a fracture or dislocation.
5. An adrenal mass was incidentally noted, which will require further evaluation once the patient's acute issues are resolved.
6. The patient is experiencing hypotension, which was managed by weaning off pressors.
7. The patient has acute renal failure, as evidenced by oliguria (low urine output) and hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels).
8. The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss.
9. The patient has atrial fibrillation (Afib) and requires further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and respiratory support.
2. Sepsis due to the presence of an adrenal mass and potential bacterial colonization.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and the presence of a femoral neck fracture.
4. Further compromise of renal function due to ongoing oliguria and hyperkalemia.
5. Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to Afib and potential electrolyte imbalances.
6. Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and the presence of a femoral neck fracture.
7. Potential for further bleeding due to the presence of an adrenal mass and potential vascular injury.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and overall clinical status to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Hold home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   -
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR showed retrocardiac opacity with ? atelectasis vs
   consolidation
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - Hold home torsemide dose this morning
   - Goal K < 5.5 prior to OR (consider kayexelate if needed)
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,
   for which differential considerations include an adrenal or renal mass,
   or a renal cyst"" seen on abdominal ultrasound [**1-8**]. Cortisol wnl.
   - MRI abdomen, non-urgent
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   -
   .
   # POSSIBLE PNEUMONIA. Initial CXR concerning for retrocardiac opacity.
   Pt received levofloxacin in ED. No WBC, no respiratory symptoms.
   - Repeat CXR showed retrocardiac opacity with ? atelectasis vs
   consolidation
   - Hold levofloxacin in setting of low clinical suspicion for PNA and
   multiple episodes of C. Diff.
   - Sputum cx not yet logged, urine legionella negative
   - Continue ipratropium nebs
   .
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA. Had pancytopenia at prior admission, normalized
   during treatment. HIT ruled out, but heparin products avoided because
   initial GP4 antibody positive (Serotonin assay negative). DDx
   dilutional (most likely) vs consumptive vs chronic disease
   - Monitor for now, transfuse for Plt < 30
   .
   # RECURRENT C. DIFF INFECTION. Currently on PO Vanco taper. No diarrhea
   currently.
   - Continue PO Vancomycin taper as above.
   - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation. Holding ASA in setting of low Hct; not on
   Coumadin due to GIB.
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Metoprolol for rate control, hold for SBP < 100.
   .
   # CHRONIC ANEMIA. Baseline Hct 30; likely secondary to CKD/chronic
   disease.
   - Consider Epo
   .
   # CHRONIC VENOUS STASIS.
   - Wound care for left leg ulcer.
   - Teds
   .
   # INABILITY TO TAKE PO MEDS. Pt somewhat sleep late last night, and PO
   meds held. Will monitor and if no improvement during day will consult
   speech/swallow.
   - Crush meds PRN

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a left intertrochanteric fracture, s/p ORIF, and a history of diastolic CHF, stage IV CKD, and HTN. He presents with hypotension, acute bleed, and hematoma. The patient has a low Hct, and his creatinine is trending up. He is also experiencing left arm and shoulder pain, hyperkalemia, and possible pneumonia. He has a history of C. diff infection and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further work-up is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's increasing creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI. This may be due to hypovolemia, dehydration, or underlying CKD.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's low Hct and acute bleed suggest the possibility of bleeding complications. Further monitoring and transfusion of blood products may be necessary.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to pneumonia. Further work-up, including sputum cultures and blood cultures, is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to dilutional, consumptive, or chronic disease. Further monitoring and transfusion of platelets may be necessary.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may be due to hemolysis, underlying CKD, or other causes. Further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Chronic Venous Stasis: The patient's history of chronic venous stasis may lead to wound complications and increased risk of infection.
8. Inability to Take PO Meds: The patient's inability to take PO meds may lead to inadequate treatment and potential complications.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, urine output, and electrolyte levels.
2. Continue to provide gentle IVF and transfusion of blood products as necessary to maintain a stable blood pressure and Hct.
3. Continue to monitor for signs of bleeding complications and take appropriate measures to prevent bleeding.
4. Continue to monitor for signs of pneumonia and take appropriate measures to treat the infection.
5. Continue to monitor for signs of thrombocytopenia and take appropriate measures to treat the condition.
6. Continue to monitor for signs of hyperkalemia and take appropriate measures to treat the condition.
7. Continue to provide wound care for the patient's chronic venous stasis.
8. Consider consulting speech and swallow therapy to improve the patient's ability to take PO meds.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's code status and make adjustments as necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is an 87 yo male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF 65%
   1/10), AFib not on coumadin, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who
   presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was
   found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture admitted to the MICU
   for hypotension now  day 1 s/p ORIF.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION/ACUTE BLEED/HEMATURIA. Baseline bp per [**3-31**] discharge
   summary is sbp 90s-100. Patient found to have sbp in 80s in ED, now
   improved to 100s with IVF. Ddx = septic shock (given hypothermia, but
   this is pt
s baseline per wife and chart and he has no WBC),
   hypovolemia in setting of dehydration or acute bleed (eg
   retroperitoneal bleed or soft tissue hematoma in setting of hip fx
   though initial CT negative, or GIB though guaiac negative in ED, or GU
   bleed; Hct 29 in clinic to 22.9 here, though after 2+ L IVF and likely
   dilutional in part), vasovagal in setting of severe pain, cardiogenic
   in setting of severe CHF, adrenal insufficiency (cortisol normal). Most
   likely due to combination of dehydration +/- acute bleed in setting of
   poor cardiac function.
   - Infectious work-up: blood cx, urine cx, urinalysis, sputum cx; repeat
   CXR
   - Gentle IVF or pRBC as needed to maintain SBP > 90, careful to monitor
   volume status in setting of severe CHF
   - Hold ASA for now given low Hct
   - Bumped appropriately after 2 units pRBC night of [**4-6**]; 1 unit
   overnight.  re-transfuse for Hct < 25
   - Found to have hematuria; will follow (no pain suggesting stone;
   possibly [**1-31**] Foley insertion)
   - Guaiac stools
   - Monitor physical exam for signs of hematoma formation at site of
   fracture, and re-scan if develops signs of dramatic bleed to rule out
   retroperitoneal bleed
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr, though currently 10-20ml/hr
   .
   # LEFT HIP FRACTURE:  s/p ORIF with TFN
   - F/U orthopedics recs
   - WBAT
   - Monitor for signs of complications (soft tissue hematoma,
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   - Morphine for pain, monitoring blood pressure closely
   - Continue BB
   - enoxaparin SQ 30mg Q24 monitor closely given history of HIT positive
   antibody but negative serotonin release assay
   .
   # CKD - stage IV. Creatinine baseline 2.0, on admission elevated to
   2.7, now trending up to 3.9. Likely prerenal in setting of hypotension,
   though FEUN 51% and FeNa 5%. Creatinine now up to 3.9 post-op; UOP
   dwindling
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Gentle hydration with blood products/fluids
   - Hold torsemide
   -renal consult
   - Monitor for signs of uremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis, volume overload
   .
   # LEFT ARM/SHOULDER PAIN:  Patient may have injured LUE during fall
   he landed on his left side, but is unable to recall whether he had pain
   in his arm at that time. Limited internal/external rotation of L
   shoulder on exam.
   - Plain films of shoulder with no fracture or dislocation
   .
   # CHF - endstage. Difficult to titrate meds in setting of CKD. Weight
   baseline about 160, on [**4-6**] is 167 lb, had been stable throughout last
   week in rehab.
   - Daily weights
   - Hold torsemide 40 [**Hospital1 7**] given elevated creatinine
   - Hold spironolactone for now in setting of hyperkalemia
   - Continue BB
   - discuss restarting ASA
   - Continue statin
   - Goal UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: Possibly secondary to hemolysis post-transfusions.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold spironolactone
   - consider restart torsemide
   - give dose of kayexcelate
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission (8x6.2
   cm). Non-urgent adrenal MRI recommended by radiology for further
   characterization. Not evident on prior MRI [**2-7**], but ""Large but poorly
   assessed hypoechoic area (4 cm) in the region of the left upper pole,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diastolic CHF, AFib, mild AS, stage IV CKD, and HTN, who presents from acute rehab after falling at his nursing home and was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture. He was admitted to the MICU for hypotension and is now day 1 s/p ORIF.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Hypotension/acute bleed/hematuria: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 100s, but he has a history of hypotension and is at risk for bleeding due to his fracture and CKD.
* Left hip fracture: The patient underwent ORIF and is at risk for complications such as soft tissue hematoma and retroperitoneal bleed.
* CKD - stage IV: The patient's creatinine is trending up to 3.9, likely due to prerenal azotemia in the setting of hypotension.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, possibly due to hemolysis post-transfusion.
* Chronic anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct of 30, likely secondary to CKD/chronic disease.
* Chronic venous stasis: The patient has a left leg ulcer and is at risk for further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock
* Cardiogenic shock
* Hypovolemic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pulmonary embolism
* Deep vein thrombosis
* Pneumonia
* Acute kidney injury
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Acidosis
* Volume overload

The patient's medications include:

* Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis
* Metoprolol for rate control
* Torsemide for diuretic therapy
* Spironolactone for potassium-sparing diuretic therapy
* Statin for lipid-lowering therapy
* Enoxaparin for anticoagulation therapy
* Vancomycin for antibiotic therapy
* Morphine for pain management

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Creatinine: 3.9 mg/dL
* Potassium: 5.3 mEq/L
* Hematocrit: 22.8%
* Platelet count: 128
* White blood cell count: 8.2
* Blood urea nitrogen: 51%
* FeNa: 5%

The patient's vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 82 bpm
* Blood pressure: 107/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
