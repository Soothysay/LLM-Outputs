You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol (EtOH) abuse, who presents intoxicated and hypoxic. He has been receiving Valium for withdrawal symptoms and has been monitored in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 93%. The patient's respiratory support includes a multi-lumen catheter and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Assessment:

The patient's condition is critical, and he is at risk for several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and COPD make him prone to respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypoxemia and hypotension make him susceptible to sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could indicate cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and tremors could indicate neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma and EtOH abuse make him prone to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and history of lung adenocarcinoma make him susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Plan:

The patient's plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status.
2. Administration of antibiotics and antiviral medications as necessary.
3. Management of pain and discomfort with opioids and other medications.
4. Maintenance of hydration and nutrition.
5. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
6. Consideration of invasive mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
7. Consultation with a pulmonologist and intensivist to optimize management of the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
8. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction, and prompt treatment if necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU for ethanol withdrawal. The patient's condition has remained stable overnight, with no seizure activity. However, they are still disoriented at times and have a high score on the CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) scale.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 156/61 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 93% on room air.

The patient's lab results show mild elevations in their white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and their blood glucose level is 121 mg/dL.

The patient has a multi-lumen central venous catheter inserted on the previous day and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. They are also receiving medication for ethanol withdrawal, including diazepam (Valium) and diltiazem.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, alcohol abuse, and dyspnea (shortness of breath). They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control measures. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent these complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's CIWA score is still high, and they are at risk for seizure activity.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage from ethanol withdrawal.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but they may still be at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to their medication regimen and underlying condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea and high respiratory rate may indicate respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including stress ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse, who presented intoxicated and hypoxic. He is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including tremors, hypertension, and tachycardia, and is being treated with Valium. The patient's hypoxia is unclear in origin, but may be related to underlying lung cancer or COPD. He has an elevated D-dimer level, which may indicate a risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has an unsteady gait, likely due to ethanol use, and mild anemia. He is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has a femoral central venous line (CVL) for infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to ethanol withdrawal and the use of Valium.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, particularly if his underlying lung cancer or COPD is not well-managed.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's elevated D-dimer level and history of cancer increase his risk of developing a PE, which could be life-threatening.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to his cancer and ethanol abuse increases his risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of ethanol abuse increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
7. Delirium: The patient's disorientation and confusion may worsen, leading to delirium, particularly if his underlying medical conditions are not well-managed."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol (ETOH) abuse, who presented intoxicated and hypoxic. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ETOH withdrawal and hypoxia. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, with no seizure activity. However, he remains disoriented at times and has been endorsing seeing animals.

The patient has been receiving valium for ETOH withdrawal and is currently on a CIWA score of 16. He has also been weaned from oxygen therapy and is being monitored for potential pulmonary embolism (PE) due to his history of cancer and elevated D-dimer levels.

Physical examination reveals a tremulous patient with decreased lung sounds at both bases, and a warm and dry skin. The patient is arousable and oriented to person, place, and year, but still endorses seeing animals.

Lab results show mild anemia, slightly below baseline, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, and he is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient is at risk for continued withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and hypertension.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying lung cancer or COPD may lead to persistent hypoxia, requiring continued oxygen therapy.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of cancer and elevated D-dimer levels increase the risk of PE, which may require further diagnostic imaging and treatment.
4. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may require further evaluation and treatment to determine the cause and potential need for transfusions.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's normal electrolyte levels may be a concern, as ETOH withdrawal can cause electrolyte imbalances.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to his underlying cancer and ETOH abuse may increase the risk of infection.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and tachycardia may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias."

   60 y/o M with hx of lung adenocarcinoma and etoh abuse who presents
   intoxicated and hypoxic. Unable to obtain reliable history.
   # ETOH withdrawal: Pt. initially actively intoxicated but has limited
   signs of withdrawal on exam. Is tremulous and hypertensive and
   tachycardic.  CIWAs down to 16 from 22.
   - stop IV valium
   - continue PO valium 10 mg PO for CIWA >10
   - social work consult
   - continue thaimine/folate/MVI
   - psych consult
   # Hypoxia: unclear etiology at this time; likely is secondary to
   underlying lung cancer or COPD. Does not seem to be in respiratory
   stress and was weaned from 4 to 2LNC. Patient unable to tolerate PIV
   and get CTA. Could potentially have a PE as his DDimer was elevated and
   he has a hx of cancer however tachycardia has now resolved and
   likelihood of PE overall seems low. Was given lovenox in the ED.  Pt.
   is no longer tachycardic or hypertensive.
   - wean as tolerated today
   - obtain PICC today
   - hold on lovenox for now
   # Unsteady gait: likely from etoh use.  PT when through withdrawing.
   # Anemia: mild, slightly below baseline but has been that low before.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse, who presented intoxicated and hypoxic. He is currently undergoing ethanol withdrawal, with symptoms including tremors, hypertension, and tachycardia. The patient's CIWA score has decreased from 22 to 16. He is also experiencing hypoxia, with unclear etiology, and has a mild anemia. The patient has a central venous line (CVL) and is receiving subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ethanol withdrawal syndrome: The patient's CIWA score is decreasing, indicating a possible improvement in symptoms, but he is still experiencing tremors and hypertension. It is essential to monitor his vital signs and adjust his medication as needed to prevent complications.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to his underlying lung cancer or COPD. It is crucial to continue monitoring his oxygen saturation levels and adjust his respiratory support as needed.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's tachycardia has resolved, his elevated D-dimer levels and history of cancer increase his risk of developing a PE. It is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs and consider further imaging studies to rule out a PE.
4. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may be related to his underlying medical conditions or blood loss. It is essential to monitor his hemoglobin levels and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Central Venous Line (CVL) complications: The patient has a CVL, which increases his risk of developing infections, thrombosis, or other complications. It is essential to monitor his CVL site and adjust his antibiotic prophylaxis as needed.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but it is essential to continue monitoring them to prevent imbalances, especially in the setting of ethanol withdrawal.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and lung cancer increases his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is essential to monitor his stool output and consider further imaging studies to rule out bleeding."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol (EtOH) abuse, currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to ongoing withdrawal and high benzodiazepine requirement. The patient has received 60mg iv Valium and 40mg po Valium over the past day. He is experiencing mild abdominal discomfort and has been assessed for withdrawal symptoms using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) scale. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/72 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 92%. The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated with respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and hypoxemia may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal discomfort and distension may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's EtOH withdrawal and benzodiazepine use may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or delirium.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and excessive fluid administration may lead to fluid overload and cardiovascular complications.
7. Blood Product Transfusion: The patient has received blood products, which may increase the risk of transfusion-related complications, such as allergic reactions or bleeding.
8. Wound Complications: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immobility increase the risk of wound complications, such as pressure ulcers or surgical site infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's oxygen therapy and respiratory support as needed to maintain optimal oxygenation.
3. Monitor the patient's abdominal status and consider imaging studies to rule out gastrointestinal complications.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and hypoxemia with medications as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider consulting neurology or psychiatry for further evaluation and management.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid administration accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's blood product transfusion reaction and bleeding risk.
8. Consider wound care and pressure ulcer prevention measures to reduce the risk of wound complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU for alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. He has a history of penicillin allergy and unknown allergy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg. He is receiving IV fluids and oxygen supplementation. His respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 94%. He is not receiving respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 251 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 49 and AST of 52. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his inability to assess certain vital signs, such as radial and digital pulses, and skin and neurologic exams.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary concerns are ineffective coping, alcohol abuse, and dyspnea (shortness of breath). The ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate a risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's unknown allergy and elevated liver enzymes may indicate a risk for infection.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and electrolyte imbalance may indicate a risk for hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Delirium: The patient's inability to assess certain vital signs and physical examination findings may indicate a risk for delirium.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate a risk for sepsis.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to identify any potential complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse, was admitted to the ICU due to alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. He initially showed signs of active withdrawal, but his CIWAs have decreased, and he has not required valium since 11 pm. The patient is currently on PO valium 10 mg for CIWA >10 and is being followed up with social work and psychiatric consultations. He is also being treated for hypoxia, likely secondary to underlying lung cancer or COPD, and has been weaned from oxygen therapy. The patient has a mild anemia and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalance. He has a midline catheter and is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient may experience continued withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and tachycardia, if not managed properly.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying lung cancer or COPD may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen his hypoxia.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may worsen if not addressed, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and chloride, may become imbalanced due to his underlying conditions, which could lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of lung cancer and the use of lovenox may increase his risk of DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to his underlying conditions and the use of antibiotics may increase his risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse, who is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient is experiencing mild hypoxia, which is unclear in etiology, but is likely secondary to his underlying lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is also experiencing mild anemia, which is slightly below his baseline, but has been that low before.

The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms, including tremors and decreased CIWAs, and is receiving valium to manage these symptoms. His social work and psych consults are pending, and he is being considered for Section 12.

The patient has a midline placed, and his fluid balance is stable, with a total input of 1,352 mL and a total output of 2,100 mL. His laboratory results show mild elevations in his white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, but his kidney function and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include the risk of ethanol withdrawal syndrome, hypoxia, and anemia. He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to his history of lung cancer and COPD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU due to alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. He is currently receiving valium for CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg. He is mildly tremulous and has decreased breath sounds at the bases with fine crackles. His laboratory results show mild anemia, and his electrolytes are within normal limits. He has a midline catheter and is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is still in the early stages of ethanol withdrawal, and the risk of seizures remains high. Close monitoring for seizure activity is essential.
2. Delirium: The patient's history of lung cancer, COPD, and ethanol abuse increases his risk of developing delirium. Monitoring for changes in mental status and behavior is crucial.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of lung cancer and COPD puts him at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with lovenox, which increases his risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of his bleeding risk and adjusting his anticoagulant therapy as needed is essential.
5. Infection: The patient's history of lung cancer and COPD increases his risk of developing infections, including pneumonia and sepsis. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are essential.
6. Thiamine Deficiency: The patient is receiving thiamine supplementation, but the risk of thiamine deficiency remains high, particularly in the setting of ethanol withdrawal. Close monitoring for signs of thiamine deficiency and adjusting his supplementation as needed is essential.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and liver disease increases his risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Close monitoring of his electrolyte levels and adjusting his supplementation as needed is essential."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol (EtOH) abuse, currently experiencing EtOH withdrawal. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for mild tremors, which are less pronounced than earlier.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 251 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 93 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Liver enzymes: mildly elevated (ALT: 49 U/L, AST: 52 U/L)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Ineffective coping
* Alcohol abuse
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

The plan is to continue Valium as needed for EtOH withdrawal, with the patient's outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Name (NI) 11954**], available to speak with him. The patient is expressing a desire to leave the hospital but has been redirectable so far. The ICU team is providing ongoing psych consultation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Seizures due to EtOH withdrawal
* Delirium tremens
* Hypoxia and respiratory failure due to lung disease and EtOH withdrawal
* Infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer disease
* Worsening of lung function due to EtOH withdrawal and underlying lung disease

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition is essential to prevent or manage these potential complications."
