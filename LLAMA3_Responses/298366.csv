   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CARDIAC CATH - At [**2188-10-30**] 12:00 PM
   Pt went to cardiac cath after intubation on integrellin, fentanyl and
   versed.
   Found to have diffuse multi vessel disease, with severe mitral
   regurgitation and left circumflex coronary artery was stented. Pt
   required placement of IABP and starting of Dopamine.  IABP was held at
   1:1 throughout the night.
   Back in CCU pt
s swan was not working and PIVs were not able to be
   placed so pt had a left arterial line and a right IJ placed.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistant ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG findings. This morning developed
   recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   - ? ischemic changes secondary to pressors, will try to wean as rapidly
   as possible.
   - Will repeat EKG in several hours to assess effect of pressor changes.
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess and
   providing minimal support since PVCs come on so quickly that augmented
   beats are very short.  Unable to capture 1:2.
 will start lidocaine drip to hopefully suppress ventricular ectopy.
   Also removed nonfunctioning swan. Hopefully once ectopy is better
   controlled will get better support from IABP.
   - tolerating vent well, would be able to try SBT and extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent catch, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She developed cardiogenic shock, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors. She also has persistent ectopy, making it difficult to assess and provide adequate support from the IABP. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease. She is currently intubated and sedated, with a Swan-Ganz catheter that is not functioning. She has a left arterial line and a right internal jugular line in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99-123 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92-142 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F) and a respiratory rate of 18-24 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if the IABP and pressors are not optimized, leading to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Ectopy: The patient's persistent ectopy may lead to arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further cardiac compromise and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pulmonary edema or cardiac tamponade.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1-1.1 mg/dL may indicate underlying kidney damage, which could worsen with further fluid overload and potentially lead to acute renal failure.
5. Iodine Dye Allergy: The patient's allergy to iodine dye may lead to anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions if she is exposed to iodine-containing substances in the future.
6. Diabetes: The patient's poorly controlled diabetes may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not adequately ventilated, leading to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Bleeding Complications: The patient's epistaxis may lead to further bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or anemia.
9. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices may increase her risk of developing infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's IABP and pressor therapy to improve cardiac function and reduce the risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's ectopy closely and consider adjusting her medication regimen to control her ventricular ectopy.
3. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with diuretics and monitor her fluid status closely to prevent further complications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adjusting her medication regimen to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes with insulin therapy and monitor her blood glucose levels closely to prevent further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting her ventilation settings to prevent further respiratory compromise.
7. Monitor the patient's bleeding status closely and consider adjusting her anticoagulation therapy to prevent further bleeding complications.
8. Monitor the patient's infection status closely and consider adjusting her antibiotic therapy to prevent further infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have diffuse multi-vessel disease, severe mitral regurgitation, and left circumflex coronary artery stenting. She was intubated and required placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine infusion. The patient has been experiencing recurrent electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, ectopy, and arrhythmias, making it difficult to assess her IABP settings. She has also been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, volume overload, acute renal failure, and an iodine dye allergy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias (ectopy, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia)
	* Cardiac failure (pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock)
	* Cardiac tamponade (pericardial effusion)
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia)
	* Respiratory failure (hypoxemia, hypercapnia)
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding (upper GI bleeding, lower GI bleeding)
	* Intestinal ischemia (mesenteric ischemia)
4. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	* Uremic syndrome
5. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures (ictal or post-ictal)
	* Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)
	* Cerebral edema
6. Infections:
	* Sepsis (bacteremia, fungemia)
	* Endocarditis (infective endocarditis)
7. Allergic reactions:
	* Anaphylaxis (iodine dye allergy)
	* Hypersensitivity reactions (to medications, contrast agents)
8. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia (diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome)
	* Hypoglycemia (diabetic hypoglycemia)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI and
   triggered on the floor for uncontrolled chest pain and shortness of
   breath.  Current presentation of multi-system illness is concerning for
   cardiogenic shock.  Limited options as (1) not responsive to diuresis
   likely due to poor forward flow, (2) poor forward flow due to
   ventricular ectopy and hypofunctional bigeminy rhythm, (3) pressors
   relatively contraindicated as would worsen arrhythmia, (4) needs
   diuresis prior to cath to prevent hypoxia, (5) needs cath to correct
   issues of forward flow by revascularization and/or IABP.
   .
   NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Patient with known CAD with
   stents in RCA and CX.  V5-6 depressions are concerning for CX lesion,
   possibly RCA.  Restenosis would likely be a/w STEs, so likely reprents
   stenosis.
   - intubated, cathed, stented and lines/IABP placed as per events above
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess.
   - Continues to require dopamine drip, will wean as possible to limit
   contribution to ectopy/arrhythmias.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   GI Bleed: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose.
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed.
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent catch, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose
 started
   on insulin drip. Will wean to ISS as tolerated.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI and
   triggered on the floor for uncontrolled chest pain and shortness of
   breath.  Current presentation of multi-system illness is concerning for
   cardiogenic shock.  Limited options as (1) not responsive to diuresis
   likely due to poor forward flow, (2) poor forward flow due to
   ventricular ectopy and hypofunctional bigeminy rhythm, (3) pressors
   relatively contraindicated as would worsen arrhythmia, (4) needs
   diuresis prior to cath to prevent hypoxia, (5) needs cath to correct
   issues of forward flow by revascularization and/or IABP.
   .
   NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Patient with known CAD with
   stents in RCA and CX.  V5-6 depressions are concerning for CX lesion,
   possibly RCA.  Restenosis would likely be a/w STEs, so likely reprents
   stenosis.
   - intubated, cathed, stented and lines/IABP placed as per events above
   - tolerating IABP well but ectopy making it difficult to assess.
   - Continues to require dopamine drip, will wean as possible to limit
   contribution to ectopy/arrhythmias.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   GI Bleed: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose.
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed.
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent catch, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose
 started
   on insulin drip. Will wean to ISS as tolerated.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department for cardiac catheterization due to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and triggered on the floor for uncontrolled chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with stents in the right coronary artery (RCA) and circumflex artery (CX).

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have diffuse multi-vessel disease with severe mitral regurgitation and a left circumflex coronary artery stent. The patient required placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and starting of dopamine.

The patient's current condition is concerning for cardiogenic shock, with limited options for treatment due to poor forward flow, ventricular ectopy, and hypofunctional bigeminy rhythm. The patient is intubated and on a dopamine drip, and the IABP is being monitored.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is concerning for cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Multi-system illness: The patient's presentation is concerning for multi-system illness, which may be related to cardiogenic shock or other underlying conditions.
3. Ventricular ectopy: The patient is experiencing ventricular ectopy, which is a common complication of cardiogenic shock.
4. Hypofunctional bigeminy rhythm: The patient's rhythm is hypofunctional bigeminy, which is a type of arrhythmia that can be life-threatening.
5. GI bleed: The patient has a large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube, which may be related to cardiogenic shock or other underlying conditions.
6. Volume overload: The patient is fluid overloaded, which may be contributing to cardiogenic shock.
7. Arrhythmia: The patient is experiencing a lot of ectopy, which is making it difficult to evaluate IABP settings.
8. Diabetes: The patient's sugars are poorly controlled, which may be related to the large steroid dose started.
9. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.1, but it is currently stable at 1.5, which may be related to poor forward flow.
10. Iodine dye allergy: The patient has a known allergy to iodine dye, which may be related to the cardiac catheterization.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring on telemetry
2. ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt
3. Insulin drip for diabetes
4. Lasix drip for volume overload
5. Mucomyst for acute renal failure
6. Electrolyte repletion
7. NPO status
8. No IV fluids
9. Full code status

   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female who was transferred to the hospital from another facility for cardiac catheterization in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease, and has undergone cardiac catheterization with stenting.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of cardiac arrest and is being treated with intravenous medications, including dopamine, lidocaine, and furosemide.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions.

The patient has a history of epistaxis and is receiving treatment with nasal packing and antibiotics. She is also receiving treatment for acute kidney injury, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.1-1.5 mg/dL.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she may be at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including diuretics and insulin, which may cause electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of epistaxis and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase her risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a history of epistaxis and is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she may be at risk for further cardiovascular instability.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Cardiovascular support: The patient is receiving dopamine and lidocaine to support her cardiac function.
2. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
3. Renal support: The patient is receiving diuretics and insulin to support her kidney function.
4. Infection prophylaxis: The patient is receiving antibiotics to prevent infection.
5. Bleeding prophylaxis: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy to prevent bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a number of medical complications, and her treatment plan should be tailored to address these risks and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 72-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease.

Current Status:

* The patient is intubated and sedated, with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
* She has a cardiac catheterization-related complication, with recurrent EKG changes in the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution.
* She is receiving inotropes and pressors, but the ectopy is making it difficult to assess and provide adequate support.
* The patient has a large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube, with a dropping hematocrit (Hct) and has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC).
* She has a history of epistaxis, and the anterior nose is packed.
* The patient has a history of acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine (Cr) of 1-1.1, and currently stable at 1.5.
* She has a history of iodine dye allergy, with secondary hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's recurrent EKG changes in the LAD distribution may indicate ongoing ischemia, which could lead to cardiogenic shock.
* Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen her cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Arrhythmia: The patient's frequent PVCs and VT may increase the risk of arrhythmia-related complications, such as cardiac arrest.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's history of acute renal failure and ongoing fluid overload may worsen her renal function and increase the risk of complications.
* Iodine dye allergy: The patient's history of iodine dye allergy may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to future contrast media.
* Diabetes: The patient's poorly controlled diabetes may increase the risk of complications, such as hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiogenic shock.
* Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent worsening of her cardiac function.
* Continue to monitor the patient's arrhythmia and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent worsening of her acute renal failure.
* Continue to monitor the patient's iodine dye allergy and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's diabetes and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent complications."

   Micro: Urine NG
   CXR:
Intra-aortic ballon pump should be pulled back. Improved
   pulmonary vascular congestion.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine and PVCs block IABP
   function.
   - will d/c lidocaine today and start amiodorone.  Will give prednisone
   given iodine allergy and iodine moiety in amiodorone.
   - if not able to medically manage, would consider overdrive pacing.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, s/p integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  This acidosis persisted on
   pressure support today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also
   with a mild A-A gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else
   would consider increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for
   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.
   .
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Will initiate tube feeds. No
   IVF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, s/p integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  This acidosis persisted on
   pressure support today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also
   with a mild A-A gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else
   would consider increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for
   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) and was treated with cardiac catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and pressors. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic status: The patient is receiving dopamine and lasix infusions to manage her blood pressure and fluid overload.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on pressure support ventilation, with mild respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has recurrent EKG changes in the LAD distribution, thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.1 and currently stable at 1.5.
* Endocrine status: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, with a large steroid dose and subsequent hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's recurrent EKG changes and pressor dependence increase the risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's mild respiratory acidosis and dependence on pressure support ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure and dependence on lasix infusion increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's poorly controlled diabetes and dependence on insulin infusion increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
* Infection: The patient's presence of an IABP and pressors increases the risk of infection.

The plan of care includes:

* Weaning off dopamine and lasix infusions to manage blood pressure and fluid overload.
* Continuing pressure support ventilation to manage respiratory acidosis.
* Monitoring the patient's cardiac status and adjusting pressors as necessary.
* Managing the patient's diabetes with insulin sliding scale and monitoring for hypoglycemia.
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting lasix infusion as necessary.
* Considering overdrive pacing if the patient's arrhythmias are not medically managed.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as necessary.
* Initiating tube feeds and monitoring for any signs of intolerance."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - Once off pump, does not need lidocaine.  Will attempt to wean
   lidocaine, but bigeminal rhythm does not allow pump to provide good
   augmentation
   - Monitor for s/s lidocaine toxicity: such as nystagmus, tremor, or
   evidence of seizure.
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, now off integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  Will switch to pressure support
   today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also with a mild A-A
   gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else would consider
   increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for extubation but pt
   unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able
   to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately. Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responding well to lasix drip.
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  Pt continues to have a lot of ectopy making it difficult to
   evaluate her IABP settings.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, requiring IABP, pressors, and persistent ectopy. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient is still experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is being managed with diuresis and pressors.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and tolerating the vent well, but has mild respiratory acidosis and a mild A-a gradient.
* Epistaxis: The patient has had a large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and her Hct is dropping to 24. She has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells and her Hct has responded appropriately.
* Volume overload: The patient is still fluid overloaded, but is responding well to diuresis.
* Arrhythmia: The patient continues to have a lot of ectopy, making it difficult to evaluate her IABP settings.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.1, but is currently stable at 1.5. This is likely due to poor forward flow.
* Iodine dye allergy: The patient has an allergy to iodine dye and has been premedicated with prednisone.

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Insulin 100 units/100 mL NS @ 0.5-5 units/hr IV drip infusion
* Aspirin 300 mg PO daily
* Lidocaine 1 mg/min IV drip infusion
* Magnesium sulfate 2 gm IV once
* Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h
* Midazolam 0.5-2 mg/hr IV drip titrated to sedation
* Clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily
* Nafcillin 2 g IV q6h
* Dopamine 5-10 mcg/kg/min IV drip titrated to MAP >60
* Pantoprazole 40 mg IV q24h
* Fentanyl citrate 25-100 mcg/hr IV drip titrated to sedation
* Potassium chloride 20 mEq/50 mL SW IV 2x
* Furosemide 5-20 mg/hr IV drip infusion
* Pravastatin 80 mg PO daily
* Heparin IV per weight-based dosing guidelines

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 96/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Complete blood count: 14.0 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27.0 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 137 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L
* Glucose: 163 mg/dL
* Troponin T: 2.57 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is:

* Intubated and sedated
* Distant heart sounds
* Occasional crackles in the chest
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm, edematous extremities

The patient's plan is to:

* Continue diuresis and pressors to manage cardiogenic shock
* Wean off dopamine and IABP once the patient is stable
* Monitor for signs of lidocaine toxicity
* Continue respiratory support with pressure support and ABG monitoring
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse as necessary
* Continue insulin sliding scale for glucose control
* Monitor for signs of acute renal failure and adjust diuresis as necessary
* Continue heparin therapy for IABP and monitor for bleeding

The patient's potential medical complications are:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient is still experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and tolerating the vent well, but has mild respiratory acidosis and a mild A-a gradient. This can lead to further respiratory complications such as respiratory arrest and pneumonia.
* Epistaxis: The patient has had a large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and her Hct is dropping to 24. This can lead to further bleeding complications such as bleeding into the brain and bleeding into the abdominal cavity.
* Volume overload: The patient is still fluid overloaded, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.
* Arrhythmia: The patient continues to have a lot of ectopy, which can lead to further arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.1, but is currently stable at 1.5. This can lead to further complications such as chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
* Iodine dye allergy: The patient has an allergy to iodine dye and has been premedicated with prednisone. This can lead to further allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status: Full code<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction with stents. She was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), pressors, and persistent ectopy.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient is no longer responding to lidocaine and has been switched to amiodarone with good response, mostly sinus rhythm.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) and IABP waves have improved, and the IABP may be weaned today after the pressor is stopped.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results are acceptable, but the patient is unable to sit up for extubation due to the IABP.
4. Epistaxis: The patient continues to experience bleeding from the posterior pharynx, and packing has been performed by the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.
5. Volume overload: The patient is fluid overloaded and is receiving aggressive diuresis with Lasix and Diuril.
6. Diabetes: The patient has been restarted on prednisone and is receiving an insulin drip.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) was 1-1.1, and currently, it is stable at 1.7, likely due to poor forward flow.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, thought to be secondary to prednisone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: Further cardiac instability, decreased cardiac output, or cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Worsening of shock, cardiac arrest, or multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Epistaxis: Hemorrhagic shock, respiratory distress, or airway compromise.
5. Volume overload: Pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, or acute kidney injury.
6. Diabetes: Hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hypoglycemia.
7. Acute renal failure: Further decline in renal function, electrolyte imbalance, or uremia.
8. Leukocytosis: Infection, sepsis, or leukopenia.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine and PVCs block IABP
   function.
   - will d/c lidocaine today and start amiodorone.  Will give prednisone
   given iodine allergy and iodine moiety in amiodorone.
   - if not able to medically manage, would consider overdrive pacing.
   - Would like to wean off dopamine, which is a likely source of ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Patient s/p stent to LCX, with resolved EKG
   findings, later developed recurrent EKG changes in LAD distribution
   thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors.
   - Needs diuresis, which will require good renal perfusion, goal MAP
   >55; Lasix gtt with goal UOP >200 cc/hr for goal -2.5 L today.
   - Once off pressors, would wean off pump
   - ASA, metoprolol, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt, s/p integrillin
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:  Patient tolerating vent well, however
   ABG shows mild respiratory acidosis.  This acidosis persisted on
   pressure support today to allow patient to autoregulate pCO2.  Also
   with a mild A-A gradient that may be assisted with diuresis.  Else
   would consider increasing PEEP.  Patient with neet to sit up for
   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   extubation but pt unable to sit up secondary to IABP. Will need IABP
   removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Pt with large amount of bloody fluid via OG tube and Hct
   dropping to 24.  Goal Hct > 25.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC with increase in lasix drip dose, hct
   responded appropriately but then fell again.  Will transfuse again 1 U
   today
   - ENT packed anterior nose for epistaxis, requested Staph coverage for
   5 days until packing removed (changed to Nafcillin from Keflex since
   unable to take PO).
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded. Responded well to lasix drip.
   .
   DIABETES: Sugars poorly controlled given large steroid dose. Now well
   controlled given no more prednisone, will switch to insulin sliding
   scale.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.5.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   .
   IODINE DYE ALLERGY: premedicated with prednisone, now with secondary
   hyperglycemia and leukocytosis.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease, who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was transferred to the hospital for cardiac catheterization. She was found to have resolved EKG findings but later developed recurrent EKG changes in the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, thought to be ischemic changes secondary to pressors. She is currently intubated and receiving invasive cardiac monitoring, and is being treated for cardiac arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, epistaxis, volume overload, diabetes, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient is at risk for further arrhythmias due to her underlying cardiac condition and the use of pressors.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but she is at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Epistaxis: The patient's epistaxis is ongoing, and she is at risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Volume overload: The patient is at risk for further fluid overload, which could worsen her cardiac function and respiratory status.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
7. Iodine dye allergy: The patient has an iodine dye allergy, which could lead to further allergic reactions if she is exposed to iodinated contrast agents.
8. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and she is at risk for further hyperglycemia and its complications.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive devices.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her treatment accordingly.
2. Consider further testing to rule out other causes of her recurrent EKG changes.
3. Continue to manage her respiratory status and consider weaning her off mechanical ventilation if possible.
4. Continue to manage her epistaxis and consider further treatment options if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor her fluid status and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider further testing to evaluate her renal function and adjust her treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to manage her diabetes and consider further treatment options if necessary.
8. Consider further testing to rule out infection and adjust her treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine, switched to Amiodarone
   with good response, mostly sinus rhythm.
   - Getting prednisone given iodine allergy, and insulin drip
   - Will DC dopamine, likely contributing to ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Improved MAP and IABP waves.
   - Will wean IABP today after pressor stopped.
   - ASA, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:
   -Most recent ABG acceptable
   -Patient with need to sit up for extubation but pt unable to sit up
   secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Continued bleeding by suction of post pharynx.
   - Day 5 today s/p packing by ENT, will return to repack or remove
   packing.
   - Transfused yesterday 1U, hct acceptable for now.
   - On Nafcillin for Staph  coverage while packed
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded.
   - Aggressive diuresis while tolerating
   .
   DIABETES: Prednisone restarted, insulin drip continued.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.9.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   - will review meds for [**Location (un) **]-toxins, adjust doses
   - ? urine for eval

   Micro: NG
   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   -Goal to prepare for CABG
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently intubated, with chronic compensated CO2
   retention.  Will extubated today.
   - Ready for SBT and extubation after IABP pulled and stable.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - Complete 7 days nafcillin for staph coverage.
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Micro: NG
   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   -Goal to prepare for CABG
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently intubated, with chronic compensated CO2
   retention.  Will extubated today.
   - Ready for SBT and extubation after IABP pulled and stable.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - Complete 7 days nafcillin for staph coverage.
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease who was transferred to the ICU for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient was previously in cardiogenic shock but is now off IABP and maintaining good pressures. The goal is to prepare for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient has a mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and preserved right ventricular function. The patient is currently intubated and will be extubated today. The patient has a history of diabetes and is on insulin therapy.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Mildly depressed LVEF
* Preserved right ventricular function
* Chronic compensated CO2 retention

   Micro: NG
   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents x 2 transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for cardiac catheterization in setting of NSTEMI, now
   s/p cath and requiring IABP, pressors and persistent ectopy
   .
   ARRYTHMIA:  No longer responding to lidocaine, switched to Amiodarone
   with good response, mostly sinus rhythm.
   - Getting prednisone given iodine allergy, and insulin drip
   - Will DC dopamine, likely contributing to ectopy
   .
   CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:  Improved MAP and IABP waves.
   - Will wean IABP today after pressor stopped.
   - ASA, plavix, statin, and heparin gtt
   .
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, INTUBATED:
   -Most recent ABG acceptable
   -Patient with need to sit up for extubation but pt unable to sit up
   secondary to IABP. Will need IABP removed before able to get extubated.
   .
   EPISTAXIS: Continued bleeding by suction of post pharynx.
   - Day 5 today s/p packing by ENT, will return to repack or remove
   packing.
   - Transfused yesterday 1U, hct acceptable for now.
   - On Nafcillin for Staph  coverage while packed
   .
   VOLUME OVERLOAD: Intubated for urgent cath, continues to be fluid
   overloaded.
   - Aggressive diuresis while tolerating
   .
   DIABETES: Prednisone restarted, insulin drip continued.
   .
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently
   stable at 1.9.  Likely from poor forward flow.
   - received mucomyst around cath. Putting out large amounts of urine to
   lasix.
   - will review meds for [**Location (un) **]-toxins, adjust doses
   - ? urine for eval
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: thought to be secondary to Prednisone.
   .
   METABOLIC ALKALOSIS with resp compensation?
 [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Micro: NG
   Ultrasound: No evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
   ECHO: The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen (may be underestimated due to poor technical quality). The
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
   anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left ventricular
   systolic function. Preserved right ventricular function.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room after undergoing cardiac catheterization for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is also receiving inotropic support with dopamine and has a temporary central access line in the right internal jugular vein.

The patient has a number of comorbidities, including:

* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) has improved, and the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) waves are improving.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and her most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results are acceptable.
* Epistaxis: The patient has continued bleeding from the posterior pharynx, and the ENT will return to repack or remove the packing.
* Volume overload: The patient is fluid overloaded and is receiving aggressive diuresis.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1-1.1, and it has now increased to 1.9. This is likely due to poor forward flow.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 18.2, which is thought to be secondary to prednisone.
* Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation.

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including:

* Nafcillin for staphylococcal coverage
* Aspirin for antiplatelet therapy
* Potassium chloride for potassium supplementation
* Bisacodyl for bowel regimen
* Pravastatin for cholesterol management
* Clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy
* Prednisone for immunosuppression
* Dopamine for inotropic support
* Fentanyl for sedation
* Heparin for anticoagulation
* Insulin for glucose management
* Midazolam for sedation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 1.9
* Hemoglobin: 27.8
* Platelet count: 94
* White blood cell count: 18.2
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20.1
* Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Echocardiogram: The right atrium is markedly dilated, and the left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen, and there is no aortic valve stenosis. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing inotropic support with dopamine
* Weaning the IABP today after the pressor is stopped
* Aggressive diuresis to manage volume overload
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting the ventilator settings as needed
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy with heparin
* Monitoring the patient's laboratory results and adjusting the medication regimen as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG.  CSurg consulted.
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently  ________, with chronic compensated CO2 retention.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - D/C Nafcillin today as 7 day course complete
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF.
   Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG.  CSurg consulted.
   - Volume status: euvolemic. Continue to watch I/Os with goal even.  No
   lasix for now.
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with dopamine
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Currently  ________, with chronic compensated CO2 retention.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - D/C Nafcillin today as 7 day course complete
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 on insulin gtt.
   - Once Prednisone stopped can switch to insulin sliding scale
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal even today for I/O
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection
   .
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Will initiate tube feeds. No

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) and stenting. She was transferred to the hospital for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She is currently off IABP and being prepared for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 116/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination is notable for mild depression of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), trigeminal rhythm, and persistent but decreased edema in the lower extremities.

The patient has a history of chronic compensated CO2 retention, and her pulmonary status is currently stable. She has persistent epistaxis, which has been managed with packing, and her endocrine status is stable with a history of type 2 diabetes managed with insulin.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis thought to be secondary to prednisone, and her renal function is stable with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.1 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her glucose level is 101 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI, stenting, and NSTEMI puts her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic compensated CO2 retention and her current respiratory status make her at risk for respiratory failure and pneumonia.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and her current neurological status make her at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures.
4. Infection: The patient's history of epistaxis and her current immunosuppressive therapy make her at risk for infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and her current medication regimen make her at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Renal complications: The patient's history of hypertension and her current renal function make her at risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's history of leukocytosis and her current medication regimen make her at risk for hematological complications, such as bleeding and thrombocytopenia.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG, c-[**Doctor First Name 213**] consulted
   - may be volume down given relatively normal EF. Will attempt to
   rehydrate with 250 cc bolus up to 1 L
   - attempt to wean dopa
   .
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with
   dopamine.  If NSVT worsens, would resume amiodoeon
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.  On FM 50%
   - Repeat ABG today.
   .
   ENT: Persistent epistaxis, with packing x 6days, now removed
   - Complete 7 days nafcillin for staph coverage.
   - Hct stable, no need for transfusion today.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO
   - Will start 9 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records); currently at 1.8.  Likely
   from aggressive diuresis.
   - will rehydrate slightly today.
   .
   HEMATOLOGY:  Leukocytosis thought to be secondary to Prednisone, no
   signs of infection.  Cultures pending

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department due to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was intubated for urgent cardiac catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. He is now off IABP and being weaned off dopamine. His current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 99 bpm (normal range: 67-109 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 114/39 mmHg (normal range: 95/33-133/49 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (normal range: 13-27 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 26 cmH2O, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) not inserted

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease, and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting. He has mild depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 40-45%.

The patient has been experiencing epistaxis, which has been managed with nasal packing for 6 days. His wound is now dry, and he has been removed from nasal packing. He has a history of diabetes and is currently receiving insulin therapy.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, pravastatin, and prednisone. He has also been receiving dopamine and heparin infusions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is a concern, given his history of NSTEMI and mild depression of LVEF. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable post-extubation, but he may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), given his history of chronic compensated CO2 retention.
3. Renal complications: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his current level is 1.8 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney injury or worsening kidney function.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA infection, and he is at risk for further infections, given his immunocompromised state and history of nasal packing.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has been receiving various medications, including diuretics and insulin, which may cause electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently receiving insulin therapy, which may cause gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's current condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring for potential complications. He will need to be weaned off dopamine and heparin infusions, and his electrolyte levels will need to be monitored closely. He will also need to be assessed for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias. His wound will need to be monitored for signs of infection, and he will need to be treated with antibiotics if necessary."

[**2188-11-5**] 11:11 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-aline.
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN CLUSTERS.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Previously in cardiogenic shock.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.  Maintaining good pressures off IABP.
   - Goal to prepare for CABG, c-[**Doctor First Name 213**] consulted
   - may be volume down given relatively normal EF.  Continue to gently
   hydrate
   - attempt to wean dopa
   .
   RHYTHM:
   - Off amiodorone as not needed now off IABP.  Does have mildly
   decreased output from trigemeny but can support pressures with
   dopamine.  If NSVT worsens, would resume amiodoeon
   - once off pressors will need afterload reduction with ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] and BB
   to prevent ectopy.
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - Will ultimately need CABG and +/- MVR if regurgitation persists s/p
   stent placement.  Limited study but MR was improved on recent echo.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.   ABG with good oxygenation
   .
   BACTERMIA: GPC in clusters in BCx.  Given recent nafcillin therapy and
   MRSA (+), likely MRSA bacteremia or skin contaminant.
   - Vanc pending speciation/coagulase positivity
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO
   - Will start 9 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records);  improved, currently at

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction (MI) with stents. She was transferred to the hospital for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She is now off IABP and is being prepared for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her cardiac function is mildly depressed with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40-45%.

The patient has a history of bacteremia with gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters, which is likely MRSA bacteremia or a skin contaminant. She is receiving vancomycin therapy pending speciation and coagulase positivity.

The patient's endocrine status is complex, with a history of type 2 diabetes worsened by prednisone. She is currently receiving insulin therapy and will be started on a sliding scale and uptitrated as needed.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a baseline creatinine of 1.1-1.4 mg/dL. She will be rehydrated slightly today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is mildly depressed, and she is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and is at risk for further infections, particularly with MRSA.
3. Endocrine complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes is complex and may worsen with prednisone therapy.
4. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is improving, but she is at risk for further deterioration and may require further management.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient has chronic compensated CO2 retention and is at risk for further respiratory complications.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac, endocrine, and renal status to prevent potential complications."

      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN CLUSTERS.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo f w/ h/o HTN, DMt2, PVD, CAD s/p MI and stents transferred from
   OSH to [**Hospital1 19**] for NSTEMI requiring intubation for urgent cath and
   requiring IABP, pressors. Now off IABP.
   .
   PUMP:  Cardiogenic shock now resolved.  Mildly depressed LVEF at
   40-45%.
   - Would consider CABG (although likely mod-high risk) or repeat cath in
   the future
   - would hydrate for hypotension
   - BP control with ACE and BB
   .
   RHYTHM:  Intermittant bigeminal rhythm with occasional NSVT.  Will
   attempt to control NSVT with electrolyte repletion and beta-blockade
   - start metoprolol today, uptitrate as tolerated
   ISCHEMIA:
   - On ASA, Plavix, statin
   - will add captopril and metoprolol today.
   .
   PULMONARY: Stable post-extubation.   Has chronic compensated CO2
   retention.   ABG with good oxygenation.  Continue to wean.
   .
   BACTERMIA: GPC in clusters in BCx.  Given recent nafcillin therapy and
   MRSA (+), likely MRSA bacteremia or skin contaminant.
   - Vanc pending speciation/coagulase positivity
   - Will pull central line once peripheral access established.
   - Echo today to r/o endocarditis.
   .
   ENDOCRINE: History of DM type 2 worse on prednisone.   Home insulin 36
   U [**Hospital1 7**], but currently NPO.  Hypoglycemic with 36 and hyperglycemic with
   24 U.
   - 24 U [**Hospital1 7**] with sliding scale and uptitrate as needed.
   .
   RENAL: baseline Cr 1- 1.1 (per OSH records);  improved, currently at
   1.4.  Likely from aggressive diuresis.
   - will rehydrate slightly today.
   .
   #. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes.
   Diet:  Cardiac/Heart healthy , Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate
   Consistency: Soft (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids
   #. Access: Right IJ, left A line.  Will go to PIV today and give line
   holiday.  Will likely need PICC once cultures cleared.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intubation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She has since been weaned off the IABP and is being managed for cardiogenic shock, intermittent bigeminal rhythm, and MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 77 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 122/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous pressure (CVP) 6 mmHg

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 20.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.6%
* Platelet count: 294 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 101 mg/dL

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is currently NPO. She is being managed with sliding scale insulin and will be uptitrated as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, but she may still be at risk for recurrent shock or complications related to her underlying heart disease.
2. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for MRSA, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and current NPO status may put her at risk for hypoglycemia, especially if her insulin regimen is not adjusted properly.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show mild electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency or damage.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient's chronic compensated CO2 retention may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Endocarditis: The patient's MRSA bacteremia may require further evaluation for endocarditis, especially given her history of heart disease.
8. Infection: The patient's bacteremia may require further evaluation and treatment for potential infections.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Adjust her insulin regimen as needed to prevent hypoglycemia.
3. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Continue to manage her cardiogenic shock and potential recurrent shock.
5. Evaluate her MRSA bacteremia and consider further treatment and monitoring.
6. Monitor her renal function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Evaluate her pulmonary status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Consider further evaluation for endocarditis and potential infections."

Micro:  [**2188-11-5**] 11:11 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-aline.
   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricula
r hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal tec
hnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overal
l left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. There are foca
l calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitr
[**Doctor Last Name **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No ma
sses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded d
ue to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
 no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**11-4**], the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comp
arison
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is reco
mmended.
IMPRESSION: very suboptimal image quality; endocarditis cannot be excluded on th
e basis of this study

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Micro:  [**2188-11-5**] 11:11 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Line-aline.
   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricula
r hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal tec
hnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overal
l left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. There are foca
l calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitr
[**Doctor Last Name **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No ma
sses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded d
ue to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
 no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**11-4**], the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive comp
arison
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic examination is reco
mmended.
IMPRESSION: very suboptimal image quality; endocarditis cannot be excluded on th
e basis of this study
   Assessment and Plan

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction (MI) with stents. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. GI bleed: The patient had an episode of bleeding with falling hemoglobin (Hct) and refuses endoscopy. He is being monitored for further bleeding and is receiving type and crossmatched blood, IV access, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia, which is likely a contaminant. The patient is being followed with remaining cultures, and vancomycin (Vanc) has been discontinued.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, but he has mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%. He is being considered for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or repeat catheterization in the future.
4. Intermittent bigeminal rhythm: The patient has an intermittent bigeminal rhythm with occasional non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). He is being treated with electrolyte repletion and beta-blockade.
5. Ischemia: The patient is being treated for ischemia with aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, captopril, and metoprolol.
6. Pulmonary: The patient has stable post-extubation with chronic compensated CO2 retention. He is being weaned off mechanical ventilation.
7. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes type 2, which is worsening on prednisone. He is being treated with insulin and sliding scale therapy.
8. Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) is 1.1, and he is being rehydrated slightly today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue to worsen, requiring further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery.
2. Infection: The patient's bacteremia may progress to sepsis or endocarditis, requiring antibiotics and close monitoring.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock may recur, and he may develop further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's chronic CO2 retention may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or respiratory distress.
5. Endocrine complications: The patient's worsening diabetes may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, requiring adjustments to his insulin therapy.
6. Renal complications: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring dialysis or other interventions.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction with stents. She was transferred to the hospital for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She is currently off IABP and pressors.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had an episode of bleeding with falling hemoglobin (Hct) and refuses endoscopy. She will be monitored for further bleeding and transfused to maintain an Hct of >27.
2. Bacteremia: A coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was isolated from a blood culture, which is likely a contaminant. The patient is unlikely to tolerate a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient had cardiogenic shock, which has resolved. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is mildly depressed at 40-45%.
4. Intermittent bigeminal rhythm with occasional nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): The patient will be attempted to control NSVT with electrolyte repletion and beta-blockade.
5. Pulmonary: The patient has chronic compensated carbon dioxide retention and is stable post-extubation. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows good oxygenation, and she will continue to be weaned.
6. Endocrine: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, which worsened on prednisone. She is currently NPO and will be given 24 units of insulin with a sliding scale and uptitrated as needed.
7. Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0-1.1, but it has improved to 1.4 due to aggressive diuresis. She will be rehydrated slightly today.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding
2. Endocarditis or bacteremia
3. Cardiac arrhythmias, including NSVT and cardiogenic shock
4. Pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
5. Renal failure or worsening kidney function
6. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy
7. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for any signs of deterioration and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction with stents. He was transferred to the hospital for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and required intubation for urgent catheterization and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors. He is now extubated and off IABP and pressors.

The patient has had several episodes of bleeding, including a gastrointestinal bleed, and has been diagnosed with bacteremia, which is likely a contaminant. He has also had cardiogenic shock, which has resolved, and has a mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40-45%. He is currently on several medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, captopril, and clopidogrel, and is being treated for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his current condition could lead to further bleeding.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, which is a serious infection that can spread to other parts of the body.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has had cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient has chronic compensated CO2 retention and may be at risk for pulmonary complications.
8. Renal complications: The patient has had a baseline creatinine level of 1-1.1 and may be at risk for further renal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and treat any further episodes promptly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's bacteremia and treat any further infections promptly.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiogenic shock and hypotension with fluids and vasopressors.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia with medications and close monitoring.
5. Monitor the patient's pulmonary and renal function closely and treat any further complications promptly.
6. Consider further diagnostic tests, such as echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and potential for further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease, who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) requiring intubation for urgent catheterization and requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors. She was extubated and is now off IABP and pressors.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac conditions. She has also been receiving IV fluids and has had a PIV line placed and a CVL removed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.

The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and platelet counts, with a slight increase in white blood cell count. Her creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* GI bleed: thought to be secondary to epistaxis, and she has been transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She is still bleeding, but her hematocrit is stable.
* Bacteremia: the patient was treated with vancomycin, but it was stopped due to the presence of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus in the blood culture, which is likely a contaminant. The patient is afebrile and off antibiotics.
* Cardiogenic shock: the patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, and she is mildly depressed with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40-45%. She is autodiuresing, suggesting further recovery of her cardiac function.
* Rhythm: the patient's rhythm is decreasing ectopy, and she is being treated with beta blockers.
* Ischemia: the patient is being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and statins to reduce her risk of ischemia.
* Pulmonary: the patient's pulmonary function is stable, and she is saturating well on room air.
* Endocrine: the patient is being treated with insulin and sliding scale insulin to control her blood glucose levels.
* Renal: the patient's renal function is at baseline.
* Fluid and electrolyte management: the patient's fluid and electrolyte status will be closely monitored and repleted as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: the patient's cardiogenic shock has resolved, but she is still at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
* Pulmonary complications: the patient's pulmonary function is stable, but she is at risk for pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
* Renal complications: the patient's renal function is at baseline, but she is at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Infection: the patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of her bacteremia and the presence of invasive lines and catheters.
* Bleeding: the patient is at risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of her coagulopathy and the presence of invasive lines and catheters.
* Hypoglycemia: the patient is at risk for hypoglycemia, particularly in the setting of her diabetes and the use of insulin and sliding scale insulin.
* Hyperglycemia: the patient is at risk for hyperglycemia, particularly in the setting of her diabetes and the use of insulin and sliding scale insulin.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications that require close monitoring and management."
