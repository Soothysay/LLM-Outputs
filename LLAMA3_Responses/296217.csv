   Imaging: CXR AP [**2127-1-14**]:
   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding
   similar study dated [**2126-8-1**]. There is no evidence of
   significant
   cardiac enlargement on this portable chest view. The pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.
   [**2127-1-1**] Change nephrostomy/pylostomy tube - IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilateral occluded nephrostomy tubes.
   2. Using multiple wires, the occlusions were broken through and access
   gained into both kidneys.
   3. Left 8 French nephrostomy tube exchange.
   4. Right upsized from 8 French to 10 French nephrostomy tube.
   5. Bilateral nephrostograms demonstrating bilateral pelvic and ureteral
   stones as previously seen. Contrast does flow to the urinary bladder
   easily on the left side; however, is held up in the distal ureter on
   the right side.

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ANXIETY
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 CHRONIC PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Check TTE
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed
   - Trend lactates, CEs
   - Pressors: now on norepinephrine
   - consider PICC when afebrile
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   # Leaking from G tube
   - G- tube to gravity
   - consider surgery
   - may need further imaging
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   No evidence of new infection.
   - f/u cultures
   - check stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR
   Went from 1.1-1.4
   - check DIC labs
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down.
   - Continue to trend.
   - f/u TTE
   - No further intervention for now, consider statin
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.
   # Depression - home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Check TTE
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed
   - Trend lactates, CEs
   - Pressors: now on norepinephrine
   - consider PICC when afebrile
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   # Leaking from G tube
   - G- tube to gravity
   - consider surgery
   - may need further imaging
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   No evidence of new infection.
   - f/u cultures
   - check stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR
   Went from 1.1-1.4

   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down.
   - Continue to trend.
   - f/u TTE
   - No further intervention for now, consider statin
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.
   # Depression - home meds.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.6°F, heart rate 114 bpm, blood pressure 110/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 13.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL, platelet count 272 x 10^9/L, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, and troponin 0.53 ng/mL.
* Imaging studies: Chest X-ray showed no evidence of new pneumothorax, and bilateral nephrostomy tubes were in place.
* ECG: Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 105 beats per minute, and lower voltage compared to prior studies.

The patient has been diagnosed with the following conditions:

* Impaired skin integrity
* Anxiety
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss
* Chronic pain
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient's medical team has initiated the following treatment:

* Antibiotics: meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage, and vancomycin for MRSA prophylaxis
* Fluid resuscitation: 2 units of packed red blood cells were transfused
* Vasopressor support: norepinephrine
* Pain management: IV hydromorphone and lorazepam
* Wound care: prophylactic wound care consult

The patient's medical team is concerned about the following potential complications:

* Leaking from the G-tube
* Nephrolithiasis with bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes
* NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels
* Sacral decubitus ulcers
* Depression

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation
* Pain management and wound care
* Consideration of stress dose steroids and PICC placement
* Follow-up with urology and wound care specialists
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction

The patient's medical team will continue to monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to ensure optimal care and prevent potential complications."

   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding
   similar study dated [**2126-8-1**]. There is no evidence of
   significant
   cardiac enlargement on this portable chest view. The pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.
   [**2127-1-1**] Change nephrostomy/pylostomy tube - IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilateral occluded nephrostomy tubes.
   2. Using multiple wires, the occlusions were broken through and access
   gained into both kidneys.
   3. Left 8 French nephrostomy tube exchange.
   4. Right upsized from 8 French to 10 French nephrostomy tube.
   5. Bilateral nephrostograms demonstrating bilateral pelvic and ureteral
   stones as previously seen. Contrast does flow to the urinary bladder
   easily on the left side; however, is held up in the distal ureter on
   the right side.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has been admitted to the MICU for post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 114 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg. She has been treated with antibiotics, including meropenem and gentamicin, and has had multiple blood cultures drawn.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrostomy tubes, combined with her current symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggest a high risk of sepsis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the presence of leukocytosis and bandemia suggests that sepsis is a likely diagnosis.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are consistent with septic shock. The patient's blood pressure has been stabilized with the use of norepinephrine, but she remains at risk for further deterioration.
3. UTI: The patient's history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrostomy tubes suggests that she is at high risk for developing a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's urine cultures are pending, but the presence of leukocytosis and bandemia suggests that a UTI is a possible diagnosis.
4. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of bilateral nephrolithiasis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes suggests that she is at risk for developing further kidney stones.
5. Neurogenic Bladder: The patient's history of neurogenic bladder and the presence of a Foley catheter suggest that she is at risk for developing urinary retention and bladder spasms.
6. Chronic Pain: The patient's history of chronic pain and her current symptoms of pain and discomfort suggest that she is at risk for developing chronic pain syndrome.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression and her current symptoms of flat affect and difficulty coping with her illness suggest that she is at risk for developing depression.
8. Sacral Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's history of sacral decubitus ulcers and her current symptoms of pressure ulcers suggest that she is at risk for developing further pressure ulcers.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels to ensure that she is not developing acute kidney injury.
4. Monitor the patient's pain levels and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent depression.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's sacral decubitus ulcers and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further pressure ulcers.
7. Consider further imaging to evaluate for abscesses or other complications.
8. Consider surgery to remove the bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes and Foley catheter.

The patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes suggests that she is at high risk for developing further complications. The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest that she is at risk for developing sepsis and septic shock. The patient's history of depression and chronic pain suggest that she is at risk for developing depression and chronic pain syndrome. The patient's sacral decubitus ulcers suggest that she is at risk for developing further pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   .
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Other infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures checked but all after
   gent and zosyn.  Other possibilities for hypotension include cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed, pericardial effusion/tamponade (lower volts on
   ECG, though no reason for effusion/tamponade to be present),
   obstructive/PE (again less likely), adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia
   concern given use of etomidate).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in
   etiology.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - trend CEs and ECGs.  Check TTE in AM.
   - PM Hct.
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Check cVO2 sat; consider tfusion/inos if low.
   - Trend lactates.
   - Place CVL - femoral only could be placed.  Aline will be difficult
   given posturing.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known).
   - Pressors: try to titrate over to norepinephrine.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   .
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Consider ASA if uptrending.
   - No further intervention for now.
   .
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound.
   - Continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   .
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She was admitted to the MICU for post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (103-137 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/57 mmHg (71-133/86 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 88-97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.2 (normal range: 4-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 272 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 101 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.53 ng/mL (normal range: 0.00-0.04 ng/mL)
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0 mmol/L)
* LDH: 324 IU/L (normal range: 100-250 IU/L)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: No evidence of significant cardiac enlargement, pulmonary vasculature congestion, or pneumothorax.
* Nephrostograms: Bilateral pelvic and ureteral stones, with contrast flow to the urinary bladder on the left side, but held up in the distal ureter on the right side.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Impaired skin integrity
* Anxiety
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Chronic pain
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring blood cultures and urine cultures
* Antibiotics: meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin for double coverage
* Pressors: titrating over to norepinephrine
* Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim
* Foley catheter change due to infection
* Wound care consult for sacral decubitus
* Continue home pain, anxiety regimen
* Prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: cardiac ischemia, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias due to sepsis
* Respiratory complications: pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Renal complications: acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Neurological complications: seizures, cerebral edema, or neurogenic bladder dysfunction
* Gastrointestinal complications: gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, or vomiting
* Infection-related complications: sepsis, bacteremia, or abscesses
* Blood clot-related complications: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE)

I will continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as needed to ensure optimal management of her medical conditions and prevention of potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple sclerosis (MS), history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has a fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, and is suspected to have septic shock due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has multiple comorbidities, including chronic pain, anemia, and depression.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a UTI, and if not properly treated, can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's nephrolithiasis and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes may increase her risk of acute kidney injury, which can worsen her septic shock.
3. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may be exacerbated by her immobility and could lead to decreased mobility and increased risk of pressure ulcers.
4. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen due to her immobility and chronic pain, and could lead to decreased quality of life and increased risk of suicidal behavior.
5. Infection: The patient's decubitus ulcers and indwelling Foley catheter may increase her risk of infection, which could worsen her septic shock.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and chronic pain may increase her risk of bleeding, which could worsen her hypotension.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's MS and chronic pain may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's MS and chronic pain may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.
9. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and chronic pain may increase her risk of pressure ulcers, which could worsen her septic shock.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic pain and immobility may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation and bowel obstruction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad empiric antibiotics for UTI and septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and urinalyses to guide antibiotic therapy.
3. Perform a wound care consult to manage the patient's decubitus ulcers.
4. Consider a PICC line to reduce the risk of infection and improve venous access.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and fluids to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
6. Consider a statin and aspirin to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Monitor the patient's pain and adjust her pain management regimen as needed.
8. Consider a depression evaluation and treatment plan to manage the patient's depression.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider tube feeds or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
10. Consider a consult with a urologist to manage the patient's nephrolithiasis and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event. High suspicion these GNRs are psuedomonas. Still on
   pressors but making good urine and mentating appropriately.
   - Continue: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double coverage
   given strong possibility of pseudomonas, also vanc (no history of VRE
   known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - Check C.diff
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed

   - Add on am [**Last Name (un) **], if low, would [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   # Leaking from G tube: Per surgery, may be because bumper was not flush
   to skin. They advanced this and follow up G-tube study was
   nondiagnostic. No significant amount of contrast seen to be leaking
   around G-tube on my read.
   - F/u KUB final report.
   - f/u surgery recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue tube feeds
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: Secondary to urosepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR: Unclear etiology. Consider DIC. DIC labs normal, except
   D-dimer elevated. Platelets stable.
   - Monitor INR and platelets
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down. No wall motion
   abnormalities on echo.
   - No further intervention for now, start low dose statin
   - start aspirin after acute illness
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and concern for septic shock following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, and acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She is currently receiving treatment with meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin for suspected pseudomonas infection, and is being monitored for septic shock.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction and the presence of GNRs in her urine and blood cultures suggest that she is at risk for sepsis. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, is essential.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of bilateral nephrolithiasis and the presence of nephrostomy tubes increase her risk for kidney stone complications, such as kidney damage or obstruction.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's diagnosis of NSTEMI and the presence of elevated troponin levels suggest that she is at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's diagnosis of anemia, secondary to blood loss and hemorrhage, increases her risk for cardiac complications and may require transfusion.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's diagnosis of impaired skin integrity, secondary to bedrest and decubitus ulcers, increases her risk for skin infections and pressure ulcers.
6. Anxiety and depression: The patient's diagnosis of anxiety and depression, secondary to her medical condition and hospitalization, increases her risk for mental health complications and may require psychological intervention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy with meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin for suspected pseudomonas infection.
2. Monitor the patient for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
3. Consider imaging studies, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, to evaluate the patient's kidneys and urinary tract.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status, including her troponin levels and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes.
5. Consider transfusion for anemia, if necessary.
6. Implement wound care measures to prevent skin infections and pressure ulcers.
7. Consider psychological intervention, such as counseling or therapy, to address the patient's anxiety and depression."

   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild

   of recent demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we
   continue statin.  Hct now stable, no evidence of active bleeding.
   INR and Ptt mildly elevated, ? sepsis related, or nutritional, does not

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

We will check stool for c diff, decubiti do not

   baseline BP so will tolerate MAPS of 60 following mentation
   and UOP which has remained adequate. Suspect she may have autonomic
   dysregulation from MS and will consider adding midodrine.  In terms
   of recent demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we
   continue statin.  Hct now stable, no evidence of active bleeding.
   INR and Ptt mildly elevated, ? sepsis related, or nutritional, does not
   appear in DIC and plts remain stable. For MS we continue home meds,

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She was admitted to the MICU for post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient has a G-tube in place, which is leaking, and has a Foley catheter. She has a history of urosepsis, and her urine cultures grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), which are pending speciation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.8°C, HR 91 bpm, BP 104/60 mmHg, RR 9 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.13 mcg/kg/min
* Fluid balance: 3,446 mL of fluids administered, with a total output of 2,227 mL
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, ABG: 22/22
* Physical examination: Alert and comfortable, severe contractures of upper extremities, diminished bilateral breath sounds, pedal edema, and multiple decubiti over the spine and sacrum

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of urosepsis and her urine cultures grew GNR, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of bilateral nephrolithiasis, which could lead to further complications such as kidney damage or obstruction.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and she has a history of MS, which could increase her risk of myocardial infarction.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple decubiti over the spine and sacrum, which could lead to further complications such as infection or skin breakdown.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of bleeding and is anemic, which could lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of MS and has painful upper extremities, which could lead to further complications such as chronic pain syndrome.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently experiencing flat affect, which could lead to further complications such as suicidal ideation.

Plan:

1. Continue broad empiric antibiotic therapy (gentamicin and meropenem) pending culture results.
2. Wean the patient off norepinephrine infusion once her blood pressure is stable.
3. Check the patient's gentamicin level and adjust as necessary.
4. Continue tube feeds and advance to oral diet as tolerated.
5. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and manage any decubiti accordingly.
6. Continue to manage the patient's pain and anxiety.
7. Consider adding midodrine to the patient's medication regimen to help manage her blood pressure.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's troponin levels and manage any further cardiac complications.
9. Consider a CT scan to evaluate the patient's decubiti and rule out any further complications.
10. Continue to manage the patient's depression and suicidal ideation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT Study Date of [**2127-1-15**] 7:29 PM
   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and concern for septic shock following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, myocardial infarction, acute (NSTEMI), impaired skin integrity, anxiety, anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss, and chronic pain.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as abnormal coagulation parameters, including elevated D-dimer and INR levels. The patient's imaging studies, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and a chest X-ray (CXR), show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, gentamicin, and vancomycin, which were started due to concerns of sepsis and UTI. The patient's nutrition is being provided through tube feeds and oral intake.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis and UTI increases the risk of sepsis-related complications, including organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of bilateral nephrolithiasis increases the risk of recurrent kidney stones, which can lead to kidney damage and chronic kidney disease.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's diagnosis of NSTEMI increases the risk of myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's diagnosis of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, skin infections, and other skin-related complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's diagnosis of anemia increases the risk of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. Chronic pain: The patient's diagnosis of chronic pain increases the risk of decreased mobility, depression, and anxiety.
7. Depression: The patient's diagnosis of depression increases the risk of decreased quality of life, suicidal ideation, and increased healthcare utilization.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess for signs of sepsis, UTI, and other complications.
2. Continue to provide antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed to treat the patient's UTI and sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's nutrition and hydration status to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
4. Provide pain management as needed to manage the patient's chronic pain.
5. Refer the patient to a wound care specialist to assess and treat any skin-related complications.
6. Consider referring the patient to a mental health specialist to assess and treat any depression or anxiety.
7. Monitor the patient's INR and platelet levels to assess for signs of bleeding or thrombosis."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She was admitted to the MICU after a planned urologic procedure due to post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including meropenem and gentamicin, for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis. She has also been started on a statin and aspirin for a likely non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition is stable, with a blood pressure of 104/60 mmHg, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's skin integrity is compromised, with a leaking gastrostomy tube and a history of urosepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of bilateral nephrolithiasis may lead to further kidney damage or obstruction.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's NSTEMI may progress to a more severe form of heart attack, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or death.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's compromised skin integrity may lead to further skin breakdown, infection, or other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or other factors.
6. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may worsen due to ongoing discomfort or complications from her medical conditions.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen due to her current condition and limitations.
8. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus may lead to further skin breakdown or infection.
9. Leaking gastrostomy tube: The patient's leaking gastrostomy tube may lead to further complications, such as infection or aspiration.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing her sepsis, NSTEMI, and other medical complications while also addressing her skin integrity, pain, and depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She was admitted to the MICU with concern for septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, and acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has also been experiencing anxiety, anemia, and chronic pain.

Current Condition:

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her sepsis and UTI with meropenem and gentamicin. She has been weaned off pressors and is being monitored for hemodynamics. The patient's blood cultures remain pending, and her urine culture has grown Gram-negative rods (GNR), which is suspected to be pseudomonas. The patient's INR is elevated, and she is being monitored for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying conditions and the presence of GNR in her urine.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of bilateral nephrolithiasis increases her risk for further kidney stone formation and potential complications.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's diagnosis of NSTEMI and the presence of elevated troponin levels indicate a potential risk for further cardiac complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
5. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may worsen due to her underlying conditions and the presence of urosepsis.
6. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen due to her underlying conditions and the presence of urosepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for sepsis and UTI with meropenem and gentamicin.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust pressors as needed.
3. Obtain blood cultures and urine cultures to guide antibiotic therapy.
4. Consider adding midodrine or fluids to support blood pressure if the patient becomes hypotensive.
5. Place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) once the patient is off pressors.
6. Continue tube feeds and advance diet as tolerated.
7. Monitor the patient's INR and platelets for signs of DIC.
8. Consider referring the patient to a wound care consult for management of her sacral decubitus ulcers.
9. Consider referring the patient to a social worker for support with coping with her debilitation.
10. Consider adding low-dose statin and aspirin to the patient's medication regimen to reduce her risk of further cardiovascular complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  61F MS, neurogenic bladder with indwelling
   foley, prior episodes of urosepsis, bl nephrolithiasis w/ bl perc
   nephrostomy tubes p/w hypotension / septic shock after planned R
   ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, now with PSA in urine. Bolused 1.5L,
   Midodrine started. Levophed restarted overnight for hypot and low UOP,
   now off. CT torso without evidence of abscess, b/l effusions.
   AF  TM 100/60  90  10  94% 1L
   Alert and comfortable, severe contractures of UEs, edematous
   Diminshed BS, bb rales
   RR, no M

   2+ pedal edema
   multiple decubiti over spine/sacrum
   Labs: WBC 20, HCT 34, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.3, INR 1.2, esr 53
   IMP: Septic shock post GU manipulation, now with PSA in urine.
   Clinically improving.
   Will continue [**Last Name (un) **] for PSA UTI.  Her leukocytosis is trending down, but
   remains quite elevated.  There was no abscess on CT and this is all
   most likely from her urinary infection. We await  BM for stool c diff.
   She is now off levophed.  Her a-line is very positional, likely
   contributing to intermittent hypot as well as probable autonomic
   dysregulation from MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] con't midodrine, following UOP
   and mentation as parameters as her BP/MAPS run low.  In terms of recent
   demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we continue statin. Her
   hct remains stable, w/o evidence of active bleeding. INR and Ptt  have
   normalized--? sepsis related or nutritional. For MS we continue home
   meds, bowel reg, wound care c/s for decubiti.   We continue paxil for
   depression.   TFs and asp diet. In terms of access, will request Picc
   and then d/c fem line.  I am concerned that her RUE appears swollen .
   L, will obtain doppler. D/c aline if remains off pressors, sq hep, full
   code.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Will continue in ICU for now, Critically ill. Total time: 60 min

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - In the AM: Pressors were weaned off in the AM.  Patients BP/MAP
   dropped.  She received 1.5L of NS with some response.  However, she was
   restarted on levo as she was anasarcic and sats dropped from 98% to 91%
   w/ fluids.  She was started on midodrine 5mg tid, to be uptitrated as
   tolerated.
   - KUB final read: no contrast material within the stomach identified.
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] does not think there is a leak, are monitoring overnight
   - Wound consult left recs
   - Urine cx grew: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA I-cefepime/ceftaz/gent; R
   cipro/zosyn; and S to meropenem/tobramycin
   - Discontinued gent given sensitivities above; continued meropenem
   - As patient continued to require pressors, got a CT abdomen/pelvis to
   r/o abcess/infxn (which was a somewhat limited study as iv contrast
   given through central line):
   1. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection; small amount of ascites.
   2. Bl pleural effus with lung collapse and pneumonia bl
   3. Multiple renal & ureteral stones
   4. Anasarca
   5. Subcutaneous gas R forearm ? [**12-31**] IV placement vs infx
   6. Hypodense liver lesions
   7. Skin erosion at sacrum w/ exposure of sacrum & coccyx concerning for
   severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis
   - Couldn't place peripheral ivs, nurse tried and iv nurse tried, kept
   the femoral central line
   - In the AM: discontinued vanc; But restarted Vanc after CT results due
   to concern for HAP and/or osteo. Checked ESR and CRP w/ AM labs.

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the

   add the following points:  61F MS, neurogenic bladder with indwelling
   foley, prior episodes of urosepsis, bl nephrolithiasis w/ bl perc
   nephrostomy tubes p/w hypotension / septic shock after planned R

   Will continue [**Last Name (un) **] for PSA UTI.  Her leukocytosis is trending down, but
   remains quite elevated.  There was no abscess on CT and this is all
   most likely from her urinary infection. We await  BM for stool c diff.
   She is now off levophed.  Her a-line is very positional, likely
   contributing to intermittent hypot as well as probable autonomic
   dysregulation from MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] con't midodrine, following UOP
   and mentation as parameters as her BP/MAPS run low.  In terms of recent

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, with urine cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She is anasarca, with bilateral pleural effusions and lung collapse, and has multiple renal and ureteral stones. She also has skin erosion at the sacral region, concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and there is a risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis and anasarca may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and lung collapse may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and recent NSTEMI may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Wound Complications: The patient's skin erosion at the sacral region may lead to severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis, requiring surgical intervention.
6. Infections: The patient's anasarca and bilateral pleural effusions may increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or septicemia.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's multiple sclerosis may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, particularly if her sepsis is not managed promptly.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anasarca and bilateral pleural effusions may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
9. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's history of urosepsis and anasarca may increase her risk of developing hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding or hematuria.

Management:

The patient should be managed in the ICU, with close monitoring of her vital signs, urine output, and mentation. She should receive antibiotics for her urosepsis, and her septic shock should be managed with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. She should also receive pain management for her multiple sclerosis and skin erosion. Further evaluation and management of her bilateral pleural effusions and lung collapse should be performed, and she should be considered for mechanical ventilation if necessary."

   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and
   pneumonia bilaterally.
   4. Multiple renal and ureteral stones which appears more fragmented
   than prior study. Status post nephrostomy tube placement. Multiple
   hyperdense
   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: 1. Limited study as delayed images were not obtained and also

   2. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection. There is a small amount
   of
   intra-abdominal ascites.
   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and
   pneumonia bilaterally.
   4. Multiple renal and ureteral stones which appears more fragmented
   than prior study. Status post nephrostomy tube placement. Multiple
   hyperdense
   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has nephrolithiasis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, which may lead to AKI.
3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrolithiasis, which can increase the risk of MI.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum and coccyx to open air, which can lead to severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding).
6. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and is currently bedbound, which can lead to chronic pain syndrome.
7. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety and is receiving home anxiety regimen.
8. Depression: The patient has depression and is receiving home antidepressant and anxiety regimen.
9. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a question of osteomyelitis, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and pneumonia bilaterally, which can lead to respiratory failure.
11. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrolithiasis, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac failure.
12. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrolithiasis, which can increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and spinal cord injury.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's medical history and current condition suggest that they are at high risk for sepsis, AKI, MI, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's chronic pain, anxiety, and depression also require ongoing management to prevent further complications."

   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm (82-111)
* Blood pressure: 105/61 mmHg (78-119/71-89)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (7-18)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), myocardial infarction (MI), impaired skin integrity, anxiety, anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, chronic pain, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.2-27.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.3-19.6 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 272-335 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.38-0.53 ng/mL
* Glucose: 77-138 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Intra-abdominal fluid collection with a small amount of ascites
* Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and pneumonia bilaterally
* Multiple renal and ureteral stones
* Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues, possibly secondary to IV line placement
* Skin erosion at the sacral region with apparent exposure of sacrum and coccyx to open air, concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis
* Hypodense liver lesions, stable since the previous study

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the urine, with a sensitivity of 4-16 μg/mL to meropenem and tobramycin

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Progression of skin erosion and decubitus ulcer
* Osteomyelitis of the sacrum and coccyx
* Complications related to the presence of multiple renal and ureteral stones
* Myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias
* Anemia and bleeding complications

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be adjusted based on the microbiology results and the patient's clinical response. Additionally, the patient's wound care and pain management should be optimized to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - In the AM: Pressors were weaned off in the AM.  Patients BP/MAP
   dropped.  She received 1.5L of NS with some response.  However, she was
   restarted on levo as she was anasarcic and sats dropped from 98% to 91%
   w/ fluids.  She was started on midodrine 5mg tid, to be uptitrated as
   tolerated.
   - KUB final read: no contrast material within the stomach identified.
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] does not think there is a leak, are monitoring overnight
   - Wound consult left recs
   - Urine cx grew: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA I-cefepime/ceftaz/gent; R
   cipro/zosyn; and S to meropenem/tobramycin
   - Discontinued gent given sensitivities above; continued meropenem
   - As patient continued to require pressors, got a CT abdomen/pelvis to
   r/o abcess/infxn (which was a somewhat limited study as iv contrast
   given through central line):
   1. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection; small amount of ascites.
   2. Bl pleural effus with lung collapse and pneumonia bl
   3. Multiple renal & ureteral stones
   4. Anasarca
   5. Subcutaneous gas R forearm ? [**12-31**] IV placement vs infx
   6. Hypodense liver lesions
   7. Skin erosion at sacrum w/ exposure of sacrum & coccyx concerning for
   severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis
   - Couldn't place peripheral ivs, nurse tried and iv nurse tried, kept
   the femoral central line
   - In the AM: discontinued vanc; But restarted Vanc after CT results due
   to concern for HAP and/or osteo. Checked ESR and CRP w/ AM labs.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has a septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation. Her urine cultures are growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and her blood cultures are pending. She has been treated with meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including myasthenia gravis, nephrolithiasis, and a history of urosepsis. She has a Foley catheter in place and has undergone a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, bilateral pleural effusions, and skin erosion at the sacral region. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated troponin, and elevated inflammatory markers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock secondary to urosepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: The patient's urine cultures are growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a resistant bacteria that requires aggressive treatment.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's history of nephrolithiasis increases her risk of developing further kidney stones.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest a possible myocardial infarction, which requires further evaluation.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to blood loss or bone marrow suppression, which requires further evaluation.
6. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin erosion at the sacral region and anasarca increase her risk of developing further skin integrity issues.
7. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's skin erosion at the sacral region increases her risk of developing decubitus ulcers.
8. Osteomyelitis: The patient's skin erosion at the sacral region and anasarca increase her risk of developing osteomyelitis.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and skin erosion at the sacral region increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
10. Depression: The patient's history of depression and her current condition may exacerbate her depression.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Continue meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust her pressor support as needed.
3. Wean the patient off pressors today and monitor her hemodynamics.
4. Place a PICC line once the patient is off pressors.
5. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust her fluid management as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and adjust her wound care plan as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her pain and anxiety management plan as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotrispsy. She was diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, and her blood cultures are pending. She has been restarted on pressors and is being monitored for signs of end-organ perfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or coagulopathy.
2. Urosepsis: The patient's urosepsis may lead to further complications, such as pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, or sepsis-related mortality.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis may lead to further complications, such as kidney damage, kidney failure, or chronic kidney disease.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as skin breakdown, wound infection, or sepsis.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may lead to further complications, such as panic attacks, agitation, or increased heart rate and blood pressure.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may lead to further complications, such as suicidal ideation, decreased appetite, or decreased interest in activities.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, decreased exercise tolerance, or increased risk of infections.
9. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may lead to further complications, such as decreased mobility, decreased quality of life, or increased risk of falls.
10. Sacral decubitus ulcers: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcers may lead to further complications, such as skin breakdown, wound infection, or sepsis.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, urosepsis, nephrolithiasis, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, anxiety, depression, anemia, chronic pain, and sacral decubitus ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
