   Imaging: Barium esophagram
   FINDINGS: A previously placed nasogastric tube was slightly retracted
   about
   to the level where the side hole of the tube was located in the mid
   esophagus.
   Subsequently, barium was injected and the esophagus was filled with
   barium
   about from the carina to the GE junction. There was no evidence of
   leak.
   Subsequently, the nasogastric tube was further retracted with the side
   hole
   about at the level of the thoracic inlet. Barium was again injected and
   the
   more proximal portion of the esophagus was demonstrated. There was no
   evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
   junction
   into the stomach.
   At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
   the GE
   junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
   This
   location was confirmed by contrast injection.
   IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated
   part
   of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).
   [**9-29**] CT neck with contrast final read pending
   [**9-29**] CT chest
   Wet read: Mild sub q air and air likely in the braachiocephalic vein.
   No
   definite tracheal injury but close f/u recommended. Bilat lower lobe
   consolidatio/aspiration. No PTX
   No CXR this am
   Microbiology: [**9-29**] BCx negative x2 to date
   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment and Plan:
   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection.  Now with ?tracheal/esophageal
   perforation.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - plan to continue sedation as is until ?perforation cleared by
   thoracic surgery and decision re: ?intervention.
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - A line and ABG, wean FiO2 as able.
   - Anticipate sedation wean and eventual extubation once able to
   extubate per thoracic surgery.
   # ?Tracheal/esophageal perforation vs. allergic reaction.  Per ED team
   ?traumatic intubation vs. patient agitiation with tube in place, vs.
   nontraumatic allergic reaction (has seemed to respond somewhat to
   antihistamines.
   - f/u final read of pan-CT.
   - thoracics following.
   - per thoracics, plan for CT esophagram plus likely bronchoscopy and
   possibly EGD pending the above.
   - Treat possible allergic reaction with diphenhydramine, H2 blockers,
   solumedrol IV.
   # Hypotension.  Intermittently in the ED and in the MICU, particularly
   after getting fentanyl.  Not tachycardic.  UOP good.  However, now with
   some increased lactates.  Sedated and BP seems to respond poorly to
   sedating meds in general.  Also consider allergic
   vasodilation/anaphylaxis.  Now requiring very low dose phenylephrine.
   - Give 1 L NS now given rising lactates; attempt to wean phenylephrine
   as tolerated.
   - Repeat lactate.
   - Check blood cultures.  Urinalysis negative.  Other infectious workup
   as clinical picture dictates.
   - Trend UOP (has been good so far).
   - Coverage of ?aspiration pneumonia as below.
   - Aline placeed.  Now ABPs more elevated than NIBPs.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.
   --Vanc, Unasyn, Levo
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.
   - SW consult when appropriate.
   - Check LFTs.
   - IV thiamine, folate, MVI.
   # Abnormal abdominal CT.  Per rads changes very minimal and may not be
   present in final read.  Does not have surgical abdomen currently.
   - followup final read.
   # Sacroileitis.  ?chronic per rads.  Unclear medical history.
   - Collateral information.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with an unknown medical history, found down with a high ethanol (EtOH) level on board. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to concerns of tracheal/esophageal perforation. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and has been treated with antihistamines for an allergic reaction. She has also been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
* Heart rate: 66 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 127/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* White blood cell count: 12.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 160 K/uL

The patient has undergone several imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and neck, which showed mild subcutaneous air and air likely in the brachiocephalic vein, but no definite tracheal injury. A barium esophagram was also performed, which showed no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated part of the esophagus.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continued sedation until the tracheal/esophageal perforation is cleared by thoracic surgery
* Weaning of sedation and eventual extubation once able to extubate per thoracic surgery
* Anticipated sedation wean and eventual extubation once able to extubate per thoracic surgery
* Treatment of possible allergic reaction with diphenhydramine, H2 blockers, and solumedrol IV
* Monitoring of lactate levels and potential treatment with phenylephrine
* Coverage of aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics
* Consultation with social work and possible placement in a rehabilitation facility

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tracheal/esophageal perforation: The patient's tracheal/esophageal perforation is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring and prompt treatment to prevent further complications.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia is a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Allergic reaction: The patient's allergic reaction is a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with antihistamines, H2 blockers, and solumedrol IV.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with fluids and vasopressors.
5. Pulmonary consolidations: The patient's pulmonary consolidations are a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.
6. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal is a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with benzodiazepines and other medications.
7. Sacroileitis: The patient's sacroileitis is a potential complication that requires prompt treatment with pain management and other supportive care."

   FINDINGS: A previously placed nasogastric tube was slightly retracted
   about
   to the level where the side hole of the tube was located in the mid
   esophagus.
   Subsequently, barium was injected and the esophagus was filled with
   barium
   about from the carina to the GE junction. There was no evidence of
   leak.
   Subsequently, the nasogastric tube was further retracted with the side
   hole
   about at the level of the thoracic inlet. Barium was again injected and
   the
   more proximal portion of the esophagus was demonstrated. There was no
   evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
   junction
   into the stomach.
   At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
   the GE
   junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
   This
   location was confirmed by contrast injection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: Barium esophagram
   FINDINGS: A previously placed nasogastric tube was slightly retracted
   about
   to the level where the side hole of the tube was located in the mid
   esophagus.
   Subsequently, barium was injected and the esophagus was filled with
   barium
   about from the carina to the GE junction. There was no evidence of
   leak.
   Subsequently, the nasogastric tube was further retracted with the side
   hole
   about at the level of the thoracic inlet. Barium was again injected and
   the
   more proximal portion of the esophagus was demonstrated. There was no
   evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
   junction
   into the stomach.
   At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
   the GE
   junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
   This
   location was confirmed by contrast injection.
   IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated
   part
   of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).

   Assessment and Plan:
   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection and concern for airway
   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - Stop benadryl and steroids as unlikely to be allergic rxn
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated and if continued agitation will
   consider Haldol or Precedex
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - Will get echo and diurese today with Lasix, follow up UOP later this
   afternoon and reassess
   - Get CXR this morning
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.
   --Continue with Vanc, Unasyn, Levo, today is day 2
   --Get sputum Cx

   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with unknown medical history, who was found down with a high level of ethanol (EtOH) on board and was intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma/esophageal rupture. The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, and the note suggests that she may have EtOH abuse.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.9°C, Tcurrent 36.7°C, HR 66 bpm, BP 127/73 mmHg, RR 17 inspirations per minute, SpO2 92%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 10,976 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 5,605 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results are as follows: WBC 9.5, Hct 35.4, Plt 168, Cr 0.6, TropT <0.01, TCO2 26, Glucose 77, and Lactic acid 0.8 mmol/L. All other laboratory results are normal.
* Imaging: The patient has had a barium esophagram, which showed no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated part of the esophagus. A CT scan of the neck with contrast is pending.
* Microbiology: The patient's bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are negative to date.
* Plan: The patient's plan includes weaning sedation as tolerated, checking LFTs, and getting an echo and diuretic today. The patient will also receive IV thiamine, folate, and MVI.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of developing aspiration pneumonia due to her intubation and the presence of bilateral pulmonary consolidations on her chest CT scan.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases her risk of developing respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a high risk of developing cardiac complications due to her EtOH abuse and the presence of bilateral pulmonary consolidations on her chest CT scan.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a high risk of developing gastrointestinal complications due to her intubation and the presence of aspiration pneumonia.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a high risk of developing neurological complications due to her EtOH abuse and the presence of bilateral pulmonary consolidations on her chest CT scan.
* Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her aspiration pneumonia and the presence of bilateral pulmonary consolidations on her chest CT scan.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications from arising."

   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient was transferred successfully to CPAP,
   but would not tolerate an SBT without significant agitation.  She was
   extubated and appeared to be doing well at the time of rounds, though
   still requiring significant O2.  She is still several liters positive
   for her length of stay and may require further diuresis.
   - Will get CXR today.
   - 20mg IV lasix, goal 1-2L negative today.
   - Continue to follow O2 requirements off of O2.
   - treat possible pneumonia as below.
   # Altered mental status.  +high EtOH level in ED, while intubated has
   required large amounts of sedation.  We are trying precedex to allow
   weaning off of Haldol without much success.  Should be able to lift
   sedation now that she is extubated.  Then plan will be haldol if she
   has symptoms of delirium or ativan for simple agitation.
   - PRN delirium or ativan.
   - f/u status once sedation has completely cleared.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.  Sputum this morning showed PMNs
   on stain but no organisms.  Cultures all negative to date.
   --Continue with Vanc and Levo, today is day 3.  Can stop Unasyn.  Plan
   for 7 day course.
   # Transaminitis: consistent with alcohol abuse.  Does not need work-up
   in this setting as patient is asymptomatic.  We will trend LFTs as they
   should be improving.
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient was transferred successfully to CPAP,
   but would not tolerate an SBT without significant agitation.  She was
   extubated and appeared to be doing well at the time of rounds, though
   still requiring significant O2.  She is still several liters positive
   for her length of stay and may require further diuresis.
   - Will get CXR today.
   - 20mg IV lasix, goal 1-2L negative today.
   - Continue to follow O2 requirements off of O2.
   - treat possible pneumonia as below.
   # Altered mental status.  +high EtOH level in ED, while intubated has
   required large amounts of sedation.  We are trying precedex to allow
   weaning off of Haldol without much success.  Should be able to lift
   sedation now that she is extubated.  Then plan will be haldol if she
   has symptoms of delirium or ativan for simple agitation.
   - PRN delirium or ativan.
   - f/u status once sedation has completely cleared.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.  Sputum this morning showed PMNs
   on stain but no organisms.  Cultures all negative to date.
   --Continue with Vanc and Levo, today is day 3.  Can stop Unasyn.  Plan
   for 7 day course.
   # Transaminitis: consistent with alcohol abuse.  Does not need work-up
   in this setting as patient is asymptomatic.  We will trend LFTs as they
   should be improving.
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.  Social work has been unable to locate any social
   supports to date.  They will continue to work with her.
   - IV thiamine, folate, MVI.
   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes.  If she can swallow can restart diet

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down with a positive ethanol level on board. She was intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma/esophageal rupture, which has been ruled out by imaging. She continues to be agitated when sedation is weaned and has been extubated. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has a history of respiratory failure, altered mental status, and pulmonary consolidations, which are likely aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, or community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of respiratory failure and pulmonary consolidations, along with her altered mental status, increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of respiratory failure and altered mental status increases the risk of developing sepsis.
4. Delirium: The patient's history of altered mental status and ethanol abuse increases the risk of developing delirium.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and transaminitis increases the risk of developing hepatic dysfunction.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of developing electrolyte imbalances.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of prolonged immobility and ethanol abuse increases the risk of developing DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and altered mental status increases the risk of developing stress ulcer.
10. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and pulmonary consolidations increases the risk of worsening respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider the use of electrolyte supplements if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider the use of nutritional supplements if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider the use of sedation if necessary.
6. Consider the use of antibiotics to treat possible pneumonia.
7. Monitor the patient's hepatic function and consider the use of medications to treat possible liver dysfunction.
8. Consider the use of anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider the use of respiratory therapy if necessary.
10. Consider the use of psychological support and counseling to help the patient cope with her addiction and other mental health issues."

   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - Stop benadryl and steroids as unlikely to be allergic rxn
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated and if continued agitation will
   consider Haldol or Precedex
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   10mg IV at 530p, made good urine after
   - stopped benadryl and steroids
   - if agitated when weaning propofol, consider haldol or precedex or
   valium --> pharm recs: try Seroquel first as will have less QT
   prolongation
   - At 70mcg/hr of propofol, still very active --> may need to try

   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection and concern for airway
   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - Stop benadryl and steroids as unlikely to be allergic rxn
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated and if continued agitation will
   consider Haldol or Precedex
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - Will get echo and diurese today with Lasix, follow up UOP later this

   - Get CXR this morning
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down with a high ethanol level in the emergency department. She was intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma or esophageal rupture, which was ruled out by imaging. She has been agitated when sedation is weaned and requires increased sedation to keep calm. She has respiratory failure and is being treated with mechanical ventilation. She has pulmonary consolidations, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, or community-acquired pneumonia. She has a history of ethanol abuse and appears to have hepatomegaly on examination.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary consolidations may progress to pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of complications such as sepsis and respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway and her history of ethanol abuse increase the risk of aspiration, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
3. Hepatotoxicity: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and her elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatotoxicity, which could lead to liver failure and other complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may be indicative of delirium, which could worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications such as falls and respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary consolidations increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen and lead to respiratory arrest, which could be life-threatening.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and her elevated blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and her elevated liver enzymes may indicate electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and her elevated liver enzymes may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis, gastric bleeding, and bowel obstruction.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of ethanol abuse and her altered mental status may indicate nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications such as weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing."

   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on

   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient was transferred successfully to CPAP,
   but would not tolerate an SBT without significant agitation.  She was
   extubated and appeared to be doing well at the time of rounds, though
   still requiring significant O2.  She is still several liters positive
   for her length of stay and may require further diuresis.
   - Will get CXR today.
   - 20mg IV lasix, goal 1-2L negative today.
   - Continue to follow O2 requirements off of O2.
   - treat possible pneumonia as below.
    # Altered mental status.  +high EtOH level in ED, while intubated has
   required large amounts of sedation.  We are trying precedex to allow
   weaning off of Haldol without much success.  Should be able to lift
   sedation now that she is extubated.  Then plan will be haldol if she
   has symptoms of delirium or ativan for simple agitation.
   - PRN delirium or ativan.
   - f/u status once sedation has completely cleared.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.  Sputum this morning showed PMNs
   on stain but no organisms.  Cultures all negative to date.
   --Continue with Vanc and Levo, today is day 3.  Can stop Unasyn.  Plan
   for 7 day course.
   # Transaminitis: consistent with alcohol abuse.  Does not need work-up
   in this setting as patient is asymptomatic.  We will trend LFTs as they
   should be improving.
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection and concern for airway
   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient was transferred successfully to CPAP,
   but would not tolerate an SBT without significant agitation.  She was
   extubated and appeared to be doing well at the time of rounds, though
   still requiring significant O2.  She is still several liters positive
   for her length of stay and may require further diuresis.
   - Will get CXR today.
   - 20mg IV lasix, goal 1-2L negative today.
   - Continue to follow O2 requirements off of O2.
   - treat possible pneumonia as below.
    # Altered mental status.  +high EtOH level in ED, while intubated has
   required large amounts of sedation.  We are trying precedex to allow
   weaning off of Haldol without much success.  Should be able to lift
   sedation now that she is extubated.  Then plan will be haldol if she
   has symptoms of delirium or ativan for simple agitation.
   - PRN delirium or ativan.
   - f/u status once sedation has completely cleared.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.  Sputum this morning showed PMNs
   on stain but no organisms.  Cultures all negative to date.
   --Continue with Vanc and Levo, today is day 3.  Can stop Unasyn.  Plan
   for 7 day course.
   # Transaminitis: consistent with alcohol abuse.  Does not need work-up
   in this setting as patient is asymptomatic.  We will trend LFTs as they
   should be improving.
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.  Social work has been unable to locate any social
   supports to date.  They will continue to work with her.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female who was found down with a positive ethanol (EtOH) level on board. She was intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma/esophageal rupture, which was ruled out by imaging. She continues to be agitated when sedation is weaned. She was extubated and is still requiring significant oxygen. She has a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, and pulmonary consolidations.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives, and has undergone imaging studies. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, and she has a history of EtOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as she was intubated for airway protection and is still requiring significant oxygen.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pulmonary consolidations, which may be aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and she may require further sedation or antipsychotic medication.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be consistent with EtOH abuse.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, which may increase her risk of DVT.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's respiratory failure and altered mental status may increase her risk of stress ulcer.
7. VAP: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase her risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as she has been intubated and may not be receiving adequate nutrition.
9. Infection: The patient's pulmonary consolidations and altered mental status may indicate an underlying infection.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are a concern, and she requires close monitoring. She should be treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia, and her respiratory status should be closely monitored. She should also be treated with diuretics to manage her fluid status, and her sedation should be weaned off gradually. Her nutritional status should be closely monitored, and she should be given IV thiamine, folate, and MVI to support her nutritional needs. Her liver enzymes should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with antipsychotic medication if she develops delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to ethanol intoxication and traumatic intubation. She was intubated and received invasive ventilation, but has since been extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/63 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm. Her neurological examination is limited due to her altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and lipase levels. Her coagulation studies are abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Her troponin-T level is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury.

The patient's medical history is significant for ethanol abuse, and she has been treated with antibiotics, including ampicillin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. She has also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's current medications include lorazepam for sedation, and she is receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent traumatic intubation and extubation may have caused respiratory muscle damage, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent intubation and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac injury, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immobility may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's recent traumatic intubation and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing stress ulcer.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's recent intubation and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for EtOH intoxication and traumatic intubation. She was extubated and is currently improving but appears wan. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/63 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her neurological status is also stable, with the patient able to follow simple commands and respond to stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient has an inability to protect her airway, which puts her at risk for aspiration.
2. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which may be a sign of delirium.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may be a sign of shock or inadequate perfusion.
4. DVT: The patient has a risk factor for DVT due to her prolonged immobility and the use of prophylactic anticoagulation.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient has a risk factor for stress ulcer due to her prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids.
6. VAP: The patient has a risk factor for VAP due to her prolonged intubation and the use of mechanical ventilation.
7. Worsening of liver function: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which may indicate worsening liver function.
8. Kidney injury: The patient's kidney function tests (KFTs) are elevated, which may indicate kidney injury.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient has a risk factor for respiratory failure due to her prolonged intubation and the use of mechanical ventilation.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a risk factor for cardiovascular instability due to her hypotension and the use of vasopressors.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation closely to prevent aspiration and respiratory failure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and neurological function to detect any signs of delirium or worsening of altered mental status.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rate closely to detect any signs of hypotension or cardiovascular instability.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver and kidney function tests to detect any signs of worsening liver or kidney function.
5. Consider using stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent stress ulcers.
6. Consider using VAP prophylaxis to prevent VAP.
7. Consider using DVT prophylaxis to prevent DVT.
8. Consider using anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and VAP.
9. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely to detect any signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
10. Consider using stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent stress ulcers."
