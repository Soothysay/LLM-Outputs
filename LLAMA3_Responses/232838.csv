   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   80M admitted in [**Month (only) 1780**] with retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and
   empyema - isolated unusual GNR. He underwent VATS and pig-tailed
   catheter in abscess. He returned to ER with PE while off of coumadin -
   anticoagulation restarted.
   Returns now with hypoxemia and dyspnea. CXR apparently showed new left
   infiltrate and he was treated with CTX/azithro and transferred. In our
   ER, he required bipap then intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure and mental status decline.
   CT-A showed no significant changes from prior CT, head CT negative. He
   was given vanco as well and admitted to ICU.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. He has a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, and has undergone VATS and pig-tailed catheter insertion. He was previously treated with antibiotics, but returned to the ER with hypoxemia and dyspnea, requiring bipap and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and mental status decline.

Current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 142/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt (set) of 550 mL, RR (set) of 18, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 32 cmH2O, and plateau of 25 cmH2O. His ABG results show a pH of 7.65, PCO2 of 34 mmHg, PO2 of 404 mmHg, HCO3 of 39 mmol/L, and BE of -16 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished general appearance
* PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light)
* Endotracheal tube and OG tube in place
* Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Clear breath sounds
* Soft and bowel sounds present in the abdomen
* Absent right and left lower extremity edema
* Not assessed for skin and neurologic examination

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 4.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 141 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL
* Other labs, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pneumonia
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He has a history of retroperitoneal mass due to abscess and empyema, which was treated with VATS and pig-tailed catheter removal. He has also had a recent episode of pulmonary embolism (PE) while off coumadin, and anticoagulation was restarted. The patient's current condition is characterized by hypoxemia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with an ABG showing 7.65/34/404/39/16. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, and his imaging studies, including CT-A and head CT, do not show new infiltrates or PE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's rigors and hypercarbic respiratory failure suggest infection, and the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient has already had a recent episode of PE, the possibility of another episode cannot be excluded, especially given the patient's immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the underlying cause is not identified and treated.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD, CABG, and CHF makes him susceptible to cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient's recent empyema and retroperitoneal abscess increase his risk of developing secondary infections, such as bacteremia or sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and inability to eat may lead to malnutrition and related complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 32 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by a combination of chronic and acute factors, including a recent empyema and retroperitoneal collections.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500-550 mL, respiratory rate of 10-26 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.54, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 42 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 165 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, and symmetric breath sounds. His abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, and his extremities show 1+ edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 141 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. His troponin-T level is 0.15 ng/mL, and his lactic acid level is 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient's medications include midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and recent empyema, he is at risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and recent infections increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and lactic acid level suggest that he may be at risk of developing AKI.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his underlying condition is not adequately managed.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's use of midazolam and fentanyl may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's pulmonary embolism and recent surgery increase his risk of developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of pantoprazole may not be sufficient to prevent stress ulceration.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases his risk of developing VAP.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, and a history of chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient was extubated successfully on [**12-18**] but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was treated with empiric antibiotics and oxygen therapy. The patient was also started on warfarin for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 134/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Ventricular paced

The patient's physical examination reveals mild crackles at the right lung base, 1+ bilateral pedal edema, and a hoarse voice.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 141 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mmol/L
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Troponin-T: 0.15 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.9 g/dL
* LDH: 197 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest computed tomography (CT) scan: no pulmonary embolism
* Central venous catheter (CVC) CT scan: no central cause of respiratory failure
* Electrocardiogram (ECG): atrial fibrillation with ventricular paced rhythm

The patient's diagnosis is:

* Acute respiratory failure
* Pulmonary embolism
* Chronic conditions: coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism

The patient's plan includes:

* Treatment for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole
* Weaning of oxygen therapy as tolerated
* Restarting warfarin for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjusting as needed
* Advancing diet as tolerated
* Speech and swallow consult follow-up
* Prophylaxis with warfarin, pneumoboots, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia
* Pulmonary embolism recurrence
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Hypothyroidism exacerbation
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Infection due to central venous catheter or other invasive devices

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80M s/p VATS and drainage of an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess
   infected with Pantoea spp (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on
   warfarin as well as CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib admitted with
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Etiology unclear. R pleural effusion
   improved on CT. No PE on CTA. NCHCT for central cause of respiratory
   failure negative. No infectious workup in the ED, but infection is a
   likely cause. Pt empirically received ceftriaxone, azityhromycin, and
   vancomycin but was not cultured. Of note, his past empyema and
   retroperitoneal abscess were growing Pantoea spp, a Gram negative
   bacteria which can produce a beta lactamase. He was successfully
   treated with levofloxacin in his prior admission. Extubated
   successfully on [**12-18**]. Perhaps hypothyroidism and neuromuscular slowing
   of diaphragm/respiratory muscles contributes to hypercarbia.
   - ABG 12 hours post-extubation with hypercarbia, but oxygenating well;
   repeat with O2 delivery weaned down more to just 1L NC with less
   hypercarbia (ie: he is correcting himself; likely lives at baseline of
   pCO2 in 60s); also less O2 delivery likely helps his respiratory drive
   to blow off more CO2; seems to be somewhat of a chronic retainer (maybe
   due to physiology s/p effusions and empyema and abscess and surgeries)
   - Follow-up repeat ABG at noon today
 if improved, consider pull
   a-line and send to floor; if pCO2 rises again (or change in MS,
   oxygenation etc.) then non-invasive ventilation as a possibility if
   needed to help with the hypercarbia if he
s not tolerating it
   - Had been treating presumptively for aspiration PNA with vancomycin 1g
   IV BID, metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily;
   but afebrile, no leukocytosis, oxygenating well
 so d/c all these
   antibiotics today, and monitor clinically for evidence of
   aspiration/pneumonia/infection
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Crackles on exam and pedal edema, restart home lasix 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1
   month ago. He also is a risk for aspiration.
   - d/c antibiotic treatment for aspiration PNA
   - f/u blood culture and sputum culture
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with segmental pulmonary
   embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
   pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an outpatient. Admission CTA showed no
   further PE.
   - Continue coumadin at 2mg today, then up to 4mg daily (home dose) on
   [**12-20**] (wait until [**12-20**] to bump up the dose, because of the residual
   antibiotic effect on anticoagulation)
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   .
   # CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib. Vpaced.
   - Continue home ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue home pravastatin 80mg PO HS
   - Continue home metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO daily
   - Continue anticoagulation as above for PE and Afib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 35 (significantly elevated); unclear if because
   of not receiving med at rehab versus inappropriate dose
   - Increase home Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO/NG DAILY to 100mcg
   - Recheck TSH in 1 month (approx mid/late [**2189-1-2**])
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRB, replete electrolytes as needed, advancing diet as
   tolerated, speech & swallow consult f/u. Send nutrition labs (albumin,
   iron, B12, folic acid). PT consult.
   # Prophylaxis: Warfarin as above, pneumoboots, PPI (change IV to PO now
   that extubated)
   # Access: Peripherals, Aline.
   # Communication: Patient and wife.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife in [**Name (NI) **]).
   # Disposition: After noon ABG, consider call-out to floor pending pCO2
   and respiratory status. Plan for rehab after hospitalization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   a-line and send to floor; if pCO2 rises again (or change in MS,
   oxygenation etc.) then non-invasive ventilation as a possibility if
   needed to help with the hypercarbia if he
s not tolerating it
   - Had been treating presumptively for aspiration PNA with vancomycin 1g
   IV BID, metronidazole 500mg IV TID, and levofloxacin 750mg IV daily;
   but afebrile, no leukocytosis, oxygenating well
 so d/c all these
   antibiotics today, and monitor clinically for evidence of
   aspiration/pneumonia/infection
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Crackles on exam and pedal edema, restart home lasix 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Possible infection as cause of decompensation: Pt was treated for
   infection with Pantoea (an Enterobacter-like bacteria) approximately 1
   month ago. He also is a risk for aspiration.
   - d/c antibiotic treatment for aspiration PNA
   - f/u blood culture and sputum culture
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with segmental pulmonary
   embolism within the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe
   pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an outpatient. Admission CTA showed no
   further PE.
   - Continue coumadin at 2mg today, then up to 4mg daily (home dose) on
   [**12-20**] (wait until [**12-20**] to bump up the dose, because of the residual
   antibiotic effect on anticoagulation)
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   .
   # CAD: S/p CABG in [**2182**], chronically in Afib. Vpaced.
   - Continue home ASA 325mg PO daily
   - Continue home pravastatin 80mg PO HS
   - Continue home metoprolol Tartrate 50mg PO daily
   - Continue anticoagulation as above for PE and Afib
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 35 (significantly elevated); unclear if because
   of not receiving med at rehab versus inappropriate dose
   - Increase home Levothyroxine Sodium 75 mcg PO/NG DAILY to 100mcg
   - Recheck TSH in 1 month (approx mid/late [**2189-1-2**])
   .
   # FEN: IVF PRB, replete electrolytes as needed, advancing diet as
   tolerated, speech & swallow consult f/u. Send nutrition labs (albumin,
   iron, B12, folic acid). PT consult.
   # Prophylaxis: Warfarin as above, pneumoboots, PPI (change IV to PO now
   that extubated)
   # Access: Peripherals, Aline.
   # Communication: Patient and wife.
   # Code:  Full (discussed with wife in [**Name (NI) **]).
   # Disposition: After noon ABG, consider call-out to floor pending pCO2
   and respiratory status. Plan for rehab after hospitalization.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypothyroidism. He was previously treated for an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess, which grew Pantoea spp, a Gram-negative bacteria that can produce beta-lactamase.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is extubated and receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and his partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is elevated at 67 mmHg. He has mild crackles in the right lung base and pedal edema.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a paced rhythm and is receiving warfarin for prophylaxis against pulmonary embolism.
* Renal: The patient's urine output is decreased, and he has received 40mg of furosemide (Lasix) to help with fluid management.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented, but has a hoarse voice.
* Infectious: The patient was treated empirically for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, but his antibiotics were discontinued due to afebrile status and lack of leukocytosis.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypothyroidism, with a significantly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pCO2 level is elevated, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and further compromise his respiratory function.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and his current condition could lead to further embolization.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a risk of aspiration due to his hoarse voice and decreased gag reflex, which could lead to pneumonia.
* Infection: The patient's decreased urine output and pedal edema could be indicative of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated TSH level could lead to further complications, such as decreased metabolism and increased risk of infection.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and hypothyroidism could lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and decreased cardiac function.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Weaning oxygen therapy as tolerated
* Restarting home lasix 40mg PO daily
* Continuing coumadin therapy for prophylaxis against pulmonary embolism
* Monitoring for signs of infection and aspiration pneumonia
* Reassessing the patient's respiratory status and adjusting therapy as needed
* Increasing home levothyroxine sodium 75 mcg PO/NG daily to 100mcg
* Rechecking TSH level in one month
* Sending nutrition labs (albumin, iron, B12, folic acid) and PT consult
* Continuing prophylaxis with warfarin, pneumoboots, and PPI
* Monitoring the patient's code status and adjusting as needed"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   80 yo man with hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting of recnt R
   empyema and retroperitoneal collections
   Respiratory failure
 Extubated and doing wll.  Transiently hypercarbic
   overnight but better this AM and mentating clearly.  Unclear if there
   was any infectious source precipitating this event - will d/c abx.
   There may a component of hypothyroidism contributing to rspiratory
   failure - TSH of 35 - will give Synthroid 75mcg daily, check FT4, and
   adjust accordingly.  Unclear if he was recieving Synthroid at rehab.
   Hypothyroidism - as above
   PE - Cont anticoagulation for small subsegmental PE.
   Will keep in ICU this AM and monitor ABGs - could be call out to floor
   in afternnoon
   Remainder of issues per ICU team

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was extubated yesterday and was doing well, with a brief period of transient hypercarbia overnight, but his pCO2 levels have improved to the 50s this morning.

The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has a recent history of empyema and retroperitoneal collections.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/55 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as decreased levels of albumin and calcium. His troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is 35.

The patient's physical examination is notable for trace edema in both lower extremities and a warm skin. His neurological examination is normal, with no signs of focal deficits or abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continued monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs) to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation
* D/c antibiotics due to unclear infectious source precipitating respiratory failure
* Initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy with Synthroid 75mcg daily to address possible hypothyroidism
* Anticoagulation for small subsegmental PE
* Continued ICU care, with possible transfer to the floor in the afternoon

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Pneumonia or other infectious complications due to prolonged ICU stay
* Thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Hypothyroidism exacerbation or complications due to thyroid hormone replacement therapy
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, due to hypothyroidism or other underlying conditions."
