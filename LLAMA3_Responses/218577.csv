   Imaging: [**2146-11-9**] Renal US: no hydronephrosis or acute process. small
   to mod ascites
   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P
   wave flattening. Qtc 479
   .
   EKG [**2146-11-9**] 1638: unchanged except QRS improved to 136, Qtc to 469.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration,
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control:  regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines: 2 PIV
s for now, will like need some form of central access:
   triple lumen vs. HD line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has multiple metabolic derangements, including anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has also developed bandemia, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of taking sunitinib, which may be contributing to her acute renal failure and other metabolic derangements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased significantly, indicating ARF. This may be due to pre-renal, intrinsic, or post-renal causes.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may be contributing to her cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may be due to global hypoperfusion, necrotic tissue, or a type B lactic acidosis.
4. Bandemia: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be indicative of an infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreased, which may be due to sepsis, sunitinib, medication-induced thrombocytopenia, or a consumptive process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to uremia, sunitinib, or other metabolic derangements.
7. Intra-Abdominal Infection: The patient's CT scan shows possible necrotic peritoneal mass and mesenteric ischemia, which may be contributing to her lactic acidosis and other metabolic derangements.
8. Colitis: The patient's CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the transverse colon, which may be indicative of colitis.
9. DIC/TMA: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated lactate level may be indicative of DIC or TMA.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, which may be indicative of respiratory failure.

ICU Care:

The patient is currently receiving aggressive IV fluids, foley catheterization, and diuretics to manage her acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible intra-abdominal infection. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and her platelet count is being trended. She is also receiving DDAVP to manage her thrombocytopenia.

Future Plans:

The patient will be continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible intra-abdominal infection. Her platelet count will be trended, and she will receive DDAVP as needed. Her lactate level will be monitored, and she will receive insulin sliding scale to manage her hyperglycemia. Her blood pressure will be closely monitored, and she will receive antihypertensive medications as needed. Her respiratory status will be closely monitored, and she will receive oxygen therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from
   global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent
   CT with contrast.  No baseline labs prior to contrast so unclear what
   her renal function was prior to the scan.   Could also be related to
   Sunitinib which can cause acute renal failure as well (increased Cr
   reported in upto 66% of cases).
   - uric acid levels are very elevated, likely due to elevated uric acid
   from sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF, uric acid no longer
   being excreted, very concerning that the part of her functional kidney
   that is working could be injured by the large amount of uric acid in
   the blood.  Would favor using rasburicase to help bind the uric acid,
   will discuss the possibility with renal and onc.
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - f/u urine eosinophils and electrolyte studies
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K

   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from
   global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent
   CT with contrast.  No baseline labs prior to contrast so unclear what
   her renal function was prior to the scan.   Could also be related to
   Sunitinib which can cause acute renal failure as well (increased Cr
   reported in upto 66% of cases).
   - uric acid levels are very elevated, likely due to elevated uric acid
   from sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF, uric acid no longer
   being excreted, very concerning that the part of her functional kidney
   that is working could be injured by the large amount of uric acid in
   the blood.  Would favor using rasburicase to help bind the uric acid,
   will discuss the possibility with renal and onc.
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - f/u urine eosinophils and electrolyte studies
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now pending improvement in her mental status
   Glycemic Control:  regular insulin sliding scale

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has a history of nephrectomy and has received sunitinib therapy, which may have contributed to her AKI. She has also been experiencing nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 9.5 mg/dL (up from 1.2 mg/dL)
* Uric acid: 17.7 mg/dL (up from 12.2 mg/dL)
* Potassium: 6.7 mEq/L (down from 8.8 mEq/L)
* Lactate: 7.2 mmol/L
* pH: 7.38
* Anion gap: 2.8

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Weight: 65 inches
* Blood pressure: 112/63 mmHg
* Pulse: 81 beats per minute
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Neurological examination shows altered mental status, asterixis, and hyper-reflexia, consistent with uremia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Renal ultrasound to rule out obstruction
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal infection
* Lactate trend and monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Platelet transfusion and consideration of DDAVP for bleeding
* Insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia
* Renal replacement therapy (RRT) if AKI worsens or if the patient's mental status deteriorates
* Consideration of rasburicase to reduce uric acid levels

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
2. Hyperkalemia with cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
3. Lactic acidosis with metabolic acidosis and potential cardiac arrest
4. Infection with sepsis and potential organ failure
5. Bleeding with platelet transfusion and potential need for DDAVP
6. Hyperglycemia with potential diabetic ketoacidosis
7. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) with potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and electrolyte imbalances
8. Uremic encephalopathy with altered mental status and potential seizures
9. Metabolic alkalosis with potential cardiac arrhythmias
10. Intra-abdominal infection with potential perforation and peritonitis."

   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration,
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2. Differential for lactic acidosis includes renal
   failure, infection, metformin induced. CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted
   possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia
   which could be contributing to a type B lactic acidossis. However
   mesenteric ischemia is not supported on exam. Delta-delta of 2.8
   suggestive of underlinge metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - trend ABG, lactate
   - hold metformin
   - empirically cover broadly for infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   - serial abd exams
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer, who presents with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, and altered mental status. She has a history of nephrectomy and has received treatment with sunitinib, gabapentin, and metformin. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving aggressive IV fluids, diuretics, and electrolyte replacement. She has a Foley catheter and is being monitored for urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 9.5, indicating severe ARF. This may be due to pre-renal, intrinsic, or post-renal causes. The patient is receiving aggressive IV fluids and diuretics to manage this condition.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 5.5, which is still elevated despite treatment with calcium, D50/insulin, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate. This may be due to ongoing lysis from hemolytic anemia or necrotic cancer.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level is 7.2, indicating severe metabolic acidosis. This may be due to renal failure, infection, or metformin-induced lactic acidosis.
4. Infection: The patient has a bandemia, which suggests infection. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for an intra-abdominal process, given the findings on CT scan.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 67, which is low. This may be due to sepsis, sunitinib, medication-induced or consumptive process such as DIC or TMA.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is disoriented and has asterixis, which suggests uremia. She is receiving treatment for uremia, including dialysis if necessary.
7. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be due to uremia or sunitinib administration.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 273, which is high. She is receiving insulin sliding scale to manage this condition.
9. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 112/63, which is elevated. She is receiving treatment to manage this condition.
10. Back Pain: The patient is experiencing back pain, which may be due to L3 metastasis. She is receiving treatment to manage this condition.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications related to her underlying medical conditions, including ARF, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, infection, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to manage these conditions and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, insulin, and other medications to manage their condition.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.8°C (96.5°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 10.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 67 K/uL
* Creatinine: 9.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 40.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 273 mg/dL
* Electrolyte imbalances: hypocalcemia (Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia (PO4: 5.5 mg/dL)
* Coagulation studies: prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR)
* Liver enzymes: elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)
* Renal function: elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
* Hematology: anemia, thrombocytopenia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: normal pulse and blood pressure
* Respiratory: clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: soft and non-tender
* Extremities: no edema
* Skin: warm
* Neurological: attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and antibiotic use.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure due to the patient's electrolyte imbalances and cardiac rhythm disturbances.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding and stress ulceration due to the patient's coagulopathy and stress response.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and hypercoagulable state.
6. Nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and immunosuppression.
7. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to the patient's insulin therapy and glucose monitoring.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to identify any potential complications and adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

   to mod ascites
   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P
   wave flattening. Qtc 479

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2. Differential for lactic acidosis includes renal
   failure, infection, metformin induced. CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted
   possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia
   which could be contributing to a type B lactic acidossis. However
   mesenteric ischemia is not supported on exam. Delta-delta of 2.8
   suggestive of underlinge metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - trend ABG, lactate
   - hold metformin
   - empirically cover broadly for infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   - serial abd exams
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and colonic
   findings on [**11-7**] CT.
   - Cover broadly for intraabdominal process with cefepime, vanco,
   flagyl.
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 84 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), gabapentin, or comsumption such as
   DIC or TMA.

   possible. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not rapidily improve
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer, presenting with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient has undergone nephrectomy and has been treated with sunitinib, but has experienced multiple complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine clearance of 9.5, which is a significant decrease from his baseline of 1.2. The patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, and may require hemodialysis.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 5.5, which is still elevated, but has improved from 6.7. The patient may require further treatment to manage this condition.
* Lactic acidosis: The patient has a lactate level of 7.2, which suggests an underlying metabolic acidosis. The patient may require aggressive IV fluids and may need to be covered empirically for infection.
* Bandemia: The patient has a white blood cell count of 10.0, which suggests an underlying infection. The patient may require broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for intra-abdominal processes.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 63, which is a significant decrease from his baseline of 167. The patient may be at risk for bleeding and may require platelet transfusions.
* Altered mental status: The patient is disoriented and has asterixis, which suggests uremia. The patient may require further treatment to manage this condition.
* N/V: The patient has ongoing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to uremia, underlying GI infection, or medication toxicity.
* Renal cell cancer: The patient has metastatic renal cell cancer, which has spread to the lung, sternum, and L3 vertebrae. The patient may require further treatment for this condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his underlying infection and ARF.
* Acute tubular necrosis: The patient may be at risk for further kidney damage due to his ARF.
* Lactic acidosis: The patient may require further treatment to manage his lactic acidosis, which could lead to further complications.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient may require further treatment to manage his hyperkalemia, which could lead to further complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient may be at risk for bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia.
* Altered mental status: The patient may require further treatment to manage his altered mental status, which could lead to further complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Continue to treat the patient's ARF with aggressive IV fluids and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's hyperkalemia with potassium-lowering medications and monitor the patient's potassium levels closely.
* Continue to treat the patient's lactic acidosis with aggressive IV fluids and consider empiric antibiotics.
* Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's altered mental status with sedation and monitor the patient's mental status closely.
* Consider consulting a nephrologist or hematology/oncology specialist to further evaluate the patient's condition and develop a plan for further treatment.
* Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care."

   need to treat --> gave 1 dose Rasburicase 6mg --> uric acid recheck at
   9pm was 10
   --> Renal feels that Rasburicase is hard to manage and may not be
   helpful, and Onc did not have an opinion ; Renal attending felt that
   the uric acid was trending down anyway and would not likely have caused

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is much less likely given benign
   abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on presentation suggestive of
   underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is much less likely given benign
   abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on presentation suggestive of
   underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who presented with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, with several potential complications and treatment options.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and her kidney function is impaired. If left untreated, ARF can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even death.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, which can lead to metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, and even death.
4. Infection: The patient's bandemia and elevated inflammatory markers suggest the presence of an infection. If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
6. Uremic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status, asterixis, and hyper-reflexia suggest uremic encephalopathy, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
7. Intra-abdominal Process: The patient's CT scan suggests the presence of a necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia, which can lead to further complications and organ failure.

Treatment options:

1. Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT): The patient may require RRT to manage her ARF and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Antibiotics: The patient requires broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential intra-abdominal and pulmonary infections.
3. Lactic Acidosis Management: The patient requires close monitoring of her lactic acid levels and management of her metabolic acidosis.
4. Thrombocytopenia Management: The patient requires platelet transfusions and monitoring of her platelet count to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Uremic Encephalopathy Management: The patient requires close monitoring of her mental status and management of her uremic encephalopathy.
6. Intra-abdominal Process Management: The patient requires further evaluation and management of her intra-abdominal process, including possible surgical intervention.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical condition, with a focus on preventing and treating potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia:
   Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA
   neg. GI source possible given N/V/D and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most
   concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in the setting of
   necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue broad coverage
   for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - given one dose of DDAVP yesterday in setting of possible line

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has undergone nephrectomy and failed IL-2 treatment, and recently completed a 28-day course of sunitinib. Her current condition is characterized by:

* ARF with a creatinine level of 9.3 mg/dL
* Hyperkalemia with a level of 24 mEq/L
* Lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 3.2 mmol/L
* Metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 16
* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 58 K/uL
* Altered mental status with asterixis and hyper-reflexia
* Abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant
* Yellow tint and patches of hypopigmentation on the skin

The patient's electrolyte abnormalities are likely related to her ARF, which is likely caused by a combination of factors including poor oral intake, persistent nausea and vomiting, and use of diuretics. Her hyperkalemia is also likely related to her ARF.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further deterioration of renal function: The patient's creatinine level is already elevated, and further deterioration could lead to severe hyperkalemia, acidosis, and uremia.
2. Infection: The patient's bandemia and altered mental status suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and altered mental status make her at risk for bleeding, particularly if she requires invasive procedures.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further acidosis and potential complications.
5. Uremic complications: The patient's altered mental status and asterixis suggest the possibility of uremic complications, which could worsen if her renal function does not improve.

Plan:

1. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with diuretics and fluids as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy accordingly.
3. Continue to empirically cover for an intra-abdominal infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
5. Continue to trend the patient's lactate levels and adjust therapy accordingly.
6. Consider hemodialysis if the patient's renal function does not improve or if she develops severe hyperkalemia or acidosis.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider neuroimaging if her condition worsens.
8. Continue to follow up with hematology and oncology recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer who has presented with multiple metabolic derangements, including acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including poor oral intake, persistent nausea and vomiting, and ongoing use of diuretics. The pre-renal component is likely due to global hypoperfusion and contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, are also likely caused by her acute renal failure.

The patient's lactic acidosis is multifactorial, with contributions from metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen. The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely caused by lactate production, which is being exacerbated by her continued administration of metformin.

The patient's bandemia is suggestive of infection, and her CXR is negative. Her UA is also negative, but her GI source is likely given her recent diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely caused by sepsis, sunitinib therapy, or a consumptive process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).

The patient's altered mental status is likely caused by uremia, and her asterixis and hyper-reflexic symptoms are suggestive of uremia. The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely caused by uremia and sunitinib administration.

The patient's medical history is significant for renal cell cancer, which has metastasized to her lung, sternum, and L3 vertebrae. She has undergone nephrectomy and has failed IL-2 therapy. She has also received a 28-day course of sunitinib.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. Her WBC count is elevated, and her differential shows a predominance of neutrophils. Her platelet count is thrombocytopenic, and her liver function tests are mildly elevated. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, metronidazole, furosemide, and lasix. She is also receiving IV fluids and electrolyte supplements.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of her electrolyte levels, acid-base status, and renal function. She will also continue to receive IV fluids and electrolyte supplements. Her medications will be adjusted as needed to manage her symptoms and prevent complications. She will also be followed up with nephrology and hematology/oncology services to manage her acute renal failure and metastatic renal cell cancer.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may continue to worsen if her underlying causes are not addressed.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may continue to worsen if her potassium levels are not closely monitored and managed.
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis may continue to worsen if her lactate levels are not closely monitored and managed.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her bandemia and abnormal laboratory results.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may continue to worsen if her platelet count is not closely monitored and managed.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may continue to worsen if her uremia is not closely managed.
7. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may continue to worsen if her underlying causes are not addressed.
8. Metabolic derangements: The patient is at risk for metabolic derangements due to her underlying medical conditions and medications.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia:
   Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA
   neg. GI source possible given N/V/D and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most
   concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in the setting of
   necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue broad coverage
   for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - given one dose of DDAVP yesterday in setting of possible line
   procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel daily, and prior to procedures ; fibrinogen
   stable
   .
   # Altered Mental status:
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc recs
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.  Stable on insulin sliding scale now
   - RISS for now;  if she is consistently in the 200
s will likely start
   an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN:  BPs labile into 150s and 160s sometimes.
   - Hold BP meds for now
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met:   Pt not asking for pain meds
   - Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell cancer, presenting with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has multiple metabolic derangements, likely initiated by the administration of Sunitinib, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased oral intake, and global decreased perfusion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (111-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 182/107 mmHg (124-183/115-130 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (8-19 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Overweight female in no acute distress
* Neck: slightly dry mucous membranes
* Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, S1/S2 audible
* Lungs: basilar crackles, slightly diminished sounds in the right base
* Abdomen: soft, obese, non-tender, 4-5 cm abdominal wall mass in the right lower quadrant
* Extremities: no edema
* Skin: yellow tint with patches of hypopigmentation
* Neurological: awake, alert, oriented to hospital and month, but thought it was [**2136**]

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.0-14.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.2-14.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 58-89 K/uL
* Creatinine: 8.0-9.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 39.7-41.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 81-261 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.2 mmol/L
* D-dimer: 6341 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 156 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.6 mg/dL

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are:

* Acute renal failure: likely due to pre-renal component, ATN, and contrast-induced nephropathy
* Metabolic acidosis: multifactorial, with anion gap decreased to 16, and lactic acidosis likely due to metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and necrotic tissue in the abdomen
* Bandemia: suggestive of infection, with a possible GI source, and concern for intra-abdominal process
* Thrombocytopenia: stable, with a differential diagnosis including sepsis, Sunitinib, medication-induced, or consumptive process
* Altered mental status: likely due to uremia, with asterixis and hyper-reflexia, and concern for infection
* Renal cell cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, and L3 vertebrae

The patient's plan includes:

* Renal diet
* Insulin sliding scale (RISS) for glycemic control
* Hold oral hypoglycemics
* Hold BP meds
* Hold gabapentin for back pain
* Monitor for leg weakness or incontinence
* Continue broad coverage for intra-abdominal process with vanc, cefepime, and flagyl
* Follow CBC and urine cultures
* Trend lactate and platelet count
* Monitor for infection and sepsis

The patient's disposition is to be called out to oncology."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - Cr down to 7.5 from peak of 9.3
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving, continue
   to monitor mental status
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
has been coming down, continue IV fluids
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: resolved, but was suggestive of infection in setting of
   lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA neg. GI source possible given N/V/D
   and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal
   process especially in the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal
   tumor
   - will d/c vancomycin and continue cefepime/flagyl for total of 10 day
   course, today is [**3-29**]
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
all with NGTD
   - stool viral cult pending, remainder are negative
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - DDAVP with procedures
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   .
   # Altered Mental status: currently oriented to self, place and month
   but not year or president
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc recs
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.  Stable on insulin sliding scale now
   .
   #. HTN:  patient consistently hypertensive, will restart home
   metoprolol but in divided doses
   - metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met:   Pt not asking for pain meds
   - Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: Call out to oncology<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, and they have a pre-renal component likely due to poor oral intake, persistent nausea/vomiting, and ongoing use of diuretics.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely multifactorial, including lactic acidosis from metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and necrotic tissue in the abdomen.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate levels have been trending down, but it is essential to continue IV fluids and empirically cover for a possible intra-abdominal infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, sunitinib therapy, medication-induced thrombocytopenia, or consumptive process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is not completely oriented, with asterixis and hyper-reflexia suggestive of uremia, especially in the setting of ARF. It is essential to trend BUN and consider hemodialysis if renal function does not improve or if mental status acutely worsens.
6. Infection: The patient has a bandemia, which has resolved, but there is still concern for an intra-abdominal process, especially in the setting of necrosis of the intra-abdominal tumor. Empiric coverage with cefepime and flagyl is necessary.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been trending down, but it is essential to continue monitoring and adjust medication accordingly.
8. Hypertension: The patient is consistently hypertensive, and restarting home metoprolol in divided doses is necessary.
9. Back Pain/L3 Metastasis: The patient is not asking for pain medication, and it is essential to monitor for leg weakness or incontinence.

Based on the patient's progress note, it is essential to:

1. Continue IV fluids to treat metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis.
2. Empirically cover for an intra-abdominal infection with cefepime and flagyl.
3. Monitor and adjust medication for hypertension, hyperkalemia, and thrombocytopenia.
4. Trend BUN and consider hemodialysis if renal function does not improve or if mental status acutely worsens.
5. Monitor for infection, sepsis, and altered mental status.
6. Continue to follow up with hematology/oncology recommendations.
7. Restart home metoprolol in divided doses.
8. Monitor for leg weakness or incontinence related to L3 metastasis."
