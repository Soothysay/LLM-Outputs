   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who is currently admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has had intermittent atrial fibrillation in the past and was previously treated with amiodarone for rhythm control. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, requiring more oxygen than previously, and has been desaturating to the 80s. He has also been experiencing blood-tinged fluid and has required atrovent neb and oxygen therapy.

The patient's ECHO showed no effusion, EF 55%, and normal leaflets. His TSH is elevated, indicating hypothyroidism. He has a history of pseudomonas in his sputum and has been treated with zosyn and vancomycin. He has also been experiencing leukocytosis and has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxemia, hypothyroidism, pseudomonas VAP, delirium, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and history of pulmonary embolism. He is currently being treated with metoprolol, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia and has a history of pseudomonas VAP, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pseudomonas VAP and has been experiencing hypoxemia, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and requirement for high levels of oxygen therapy increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing rapid ventricular response, which increases the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding and may require platelet transfusions.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require treatment with levothyroxine, which should be considered.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may require treatment with antipsychotics and should be monitored closely.
8. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient's pseudomonas VAP may require treatment with antibiotics and should be monitored closely for signs of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Consider treatment with levothyroxine for the patient's hypothyroidism.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider treatment with antibiotics for the patient's pseudomonas VAP.
6. Monitor the patient's delirium closely and consider treatment with antipsychotics if necessary.
7. Consider treatment with stress ulcer prophylaxis to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or worsening oxygenation.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Neurological: Seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or brain death.
* Hematological: Bleeding or coagulopathy due to low platelet count.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function.
* Endocrine: Thyroid storm or hypothyroidism due to changes in thyroid hormone levels.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unclear."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: restart tube feeds via J Tube.
   #Code: FULL
   #Communication: Wife,[**Telephone/Fax (1) 4202**]
   # Dispo: back to NSG if rate controlled in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). He has undergone palliative decompression and fusion of T1-T12 and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy at 70-100% FiO2, and his oxygen saturation is in the mid-90s.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has Afib with RVR, which is being treated with metoprolol and esmolol. His blood pressure is stable at 106/58 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is unchanged from admission, with no assessment of his peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic systems.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count (CBC): The patient's white blood cell count is 7.5-10.5 K/uL, and his platelet count is 46-62 K/uL.
	+ Electrolyte panel: The patient's sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are within normal limits.
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are within normal limits.
	+ Liver function tests (LFTs): The patient's ALT and AST levels are slightly elevated, but his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are within normal limits.
	+ Thyroid function tests: The patient's TSH level is 15, indicating hypothyroidism.
* Imaging studies:
	+ Chest X-ray: The patient's CXR shows a possible infiltrate, possibly with a small amount of effusion.
	+ Echocardiogram: The patient's echocardiogram shows no effusion, with an ejection fraction of 55%.
* Other findings:
	+ The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has been transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells.
	+ The patient has a history of pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseudomonas) VAP and is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
	+ The patient has a history of delirium and is being treated with Zyprexa as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has Afib with RVR, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of delirium and may be at risk for further neurological deterioration.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GIB and may be at risk for further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas VAP and may be at risk for further infections.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is 15, indicating hypothyroidism, which can lead to further complications if left untreated.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He has undergone palliative decompression and fusion surgery and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently on anticoagulation therapy and has a history of bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.8°C (98.2°F), HR 85 bpm, BP 106/58 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%
* Respiratory support: on oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%
* Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, responsive to fluid and lopressor
* Neurological: alert and oriented, with a history of delirium
* Hematological: leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count recovering from nadir of 38,000/L)
* Renal: creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 25 mg/dL
* Hepatic: alanine transaminase (ALT) 59 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 23 IU/L
* Endocrine: hypothyroidism (TSH 15)

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxemia: the patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and he may require further oxygen therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism: the patient has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: the patient has a history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in his sputum and is currently receiving antibiotics.
4. Delirium: the patient has a history of delirium and may require further treatment to manage his symptoms.
5. Thrombocytopenia: the patient's platelet count is recovering, but he may require further monitoring to ensure it does not drop again.
6. Hypothyroidism: the patient's thyroid hormone levels are low, and he may require further treatment to manage his symptoms.
7. Leukocytosis: the patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause.
8. Renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause.
9. Hepatic insufficiency: the patient's liver function tests are elevated, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen requirement, and cardiovascular status.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with medications and fluids as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's infection workup and treat any underlying infections.
4. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with reorientation and medication as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and adjust his antibiotics as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's renal and hepatic function and adjust his medications as needed.
9. Discuss the patient's long-term plan of care with his neurosurgeon and other healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who is currently in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). He has had intermittent AFib in the past and is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control and metoprolol for rate control. The patient's recent medical history includes a MICU stay for bronchial respiratory failure (BRBPR) and a recent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion procedure. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.8°C (98.2°F), HR 85 bpm, BP 106/58 mmHg, RR 24 breaths/min, SpO2 96%
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device: trach mask, FiO2 50%
* Cardiovascular status: AFib with RVR, responsive to fluid and lopressor
* Renal function: creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 11.9 mg/dL
* Hematologic status: platelet count 63 K/μL, white blood cell count 7.5 K/μL
* Electrolytes: sodium 137 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, chloride 25 mEq/L, calcium 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium 2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus 2.8 mg/dL
* Liver function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 23 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 59 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALK) 60 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL
* Coagulation status: international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 27.8 seconds

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid status is unclear, and he may be at risk for hypovolemia given his history of AFib and rapid ventricular response.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but he may still be at risk for hypoxemia given his history of respiratory failure and pneumonia.
3. Infection/sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics for a pseudomonas infection. He may be at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. He may be at risk for developing another PE.
5. Hyperthyroidism: The patient has a history of papillary thyroid cancer and may be at risk for developing hyperthyroidism.
6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium and may be at risk for developing delirium again.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable in the 10 K/μL range, but he may be at risk for developing leukocytosis given his history of infection.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is recovering from a nadir of 38 K/μL, but he may be at risk for developing thrombocytopenia again.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is unclear, and he may be at risk for developing hypothyroidism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid therapy accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust his antibiotic therapy accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust his thyroid hormone replacement therapy accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust his platelet transfusion therapy accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust his antibiotic therapy accordingly.
8. Consider ordering a CT scan to rule out pulmonary embolism.
9. Consider ordering a thyroid function test to determine the patient's thyroid hormone levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Will plan on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for 14 day course
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro [**9-2**]
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; will
   d/c  Vanc and can restart  if cultures change
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -          Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will look into
   dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered
   in transfer orders).
   -          Now changed to 100 mg IV daily to ensure consistent dosing
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has undergone T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on August 7th.
* He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), requiring fluid and lopressor support.
* The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is currently being managed with 100 mg IV daily Synthroid.
* He has been diagnosed with pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is receiving treatment with Zosyn and vancomycin.
* The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.
* He has also been diagnosed with leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hypoxemia, and is being treated accordingly.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or stroke if not properly managed.
* The pseudomonas VAP may lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis, if not effectively treated.
* The patient's history of DVT and PE may increase his risk of developing further thrombotic events, such as recurrent DVT or PE, if anticoagulation therapy is not properly managed.
* The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to further complications, such as decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, or decreased mental status, if not properly managed.
* The patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia may be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which may lead to further complications if not properly treated.
* The patient's hypoxemia may lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis, if not effectively treated.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team.
* The patient's AFib with RVR requires continued management with fluid and lopressor support, as well as anticoagulation therapy.
* The pseudomonas VAP requires continued treatment with Zosyn and vancomycin, as well as close monitoring for signs of respiratory failure or sepsis.
* The patient's hypothyroidism requires continued management with 100 mg IV daily Synthroid, as well as close monitoring for signs of decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, or decreased mental status.
* The patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia require further evaluation and management to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
* The patient's hypoxemia requires continued monitoring and management to prevent further respiratory complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Will plan on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for 14 day course
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro [**9-2**]
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; will
   d/c  Vanc and can restart  if cultures change
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -          Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will look into
   dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered
   in transfer orders).
   -          Now changed to 100 mg IV daily to ensure consistent dosing
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not

   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the

   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has a complex medical history, including a recent MICU stay for bronchial respiratory failure (BRBPR), and has been on various medications, including amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 70-100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient is receiving various medications, including amiodarone, metoprolol, and heparin, and is being monitored for hypoxemia, infection, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 63 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show a possible infiltrate or small amount of effusion on chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram shows no effusion, with an ejection fraction of 55% and normal leaflets.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxemia, infection (Pseudomonas VAP), delirium, leukocytosis, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also being treated for hypothyroidism, and has a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Hypoxemia, which may worsen if the patient's oxygen requirement increases or if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Infection (Pseudomonas VAP), which may lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, or death.
4. Delirium, which may worsen if the patient's medication regimen is not optimized or if the patient develops other medical complications.
5. Leukocytosis, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding or hemorrhage, particularly if the patient requires invasive procedures or surgery.
7. Hypothyroidism, which may require further evaluation and treatment to ensure adequate thyroid hormone replacement.
8. Pulmonary embolism (PE), which may worsen if the patient's anticoagulation therapy is not optimized or if the patient develops other medical complications.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; d/c
     Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated
   discharge to rehab
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].  Increased tube feeds to
   Beneprotein at 70 mL/hr.

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**];
   d/c
d   Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated
   discharge to rehab
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU for Afib with RVR. He has had intermittent Afib in the past and is currently on amiodarone for rhythm control. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, requiring more oxygen than previously, and has had a recent episode of Afib with rapid rates, which was responsive to fluid and lopressor. He also has a history of DVT/PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 63. His troponin-T level is 0.03, and his BNP level is 1249. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, lansoprazole, and heparin. He has also received Zosyn for Pseudomonas VAP and has had a recent episode of LGIB.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and requirement for increased oxygen may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib and current treatment with amiodarone may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of Pseudomonas VAP and LGIB may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of DVT/PE and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still recovering from a nadir of 38,000 and may continue to be a concern.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of thyroid cancer and recent lack of levothyroxine replacement may increase his risk of hypothyroidism.
