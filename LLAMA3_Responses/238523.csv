You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, depression, and a history of suicidal ideation and substance abuse. The patient has been diagnosed with ethylene glycol toxicity, which has caused an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and a SpO2 of 99%.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which has been controlled with sedation and hydration. The patient's blood pressure is 123/60 mmHg.
* Neurological: Agitated, not following commands, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.
* Renal: Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, and a BUN level of 12.4 mg/dL.
* Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.5 mEq/L, and a calcium level of 6.8 mg/dL.
* Infection: Elevated lactate level, which could be due to ethylene glycol toxicity or an underlying infection. The patient has a leukocytosis of 26.7, and a LUL infiltrate on CXR.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's altered mental status and coagulopathy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalance may increase the risk of pulmonary edema.

Based on the patient's current condition, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation to control the patient's respiratory and neurological status.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
3. Continue dialysis to manage the patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Treat the patient's infection with antibiotics, and monitor for signs of sepsis.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist to optimize the patient's renal replacement therapy.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He received dialysis and CVVH to treat the ethylene glycol toxicity, which resolved his acidosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is still intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a SpO2 of 99%.
* He has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
* He has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.0 mmol/L.
* He has acute renal failure with a normal BUN, suggesting intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
* He has an elevated lactate level, which may be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol toxicity, but needs to be ruled out for infection.
* He has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 26.7 x 10^9/L and a LUL infiltrate on CXR.
* He has a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, including coccaine use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory complications due to prolonged intubation and invasive ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and hyperkalemia.
* Renal complications due to acute renal failure and potential prolonged need for dialysis.
* Infection complications due to elevated lactate level and LUL infiltrate on CXR.
* Neurological complications due to ethylene glycol toxicity and potential prolonged sedation.
* Psychiatric complications due to history of depression and substance abuse.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued invasive ventilation and monitoring of his respiratory status.
* Management of his atrial fibrillation with IVF and monitoring of his potassium level.
* Treatment of his hyperkalemia with calcium and insulin.
* Continued dialysis and CVVH until his ethylene glycol level is <20.
* Monitoring of his electrolyte levels and pH post-dialysis and giving bicarb as needed.
* Thiamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine therapy for 24 hours.
* Fomepizole therapy during dialysis.
* IVF with bicarb.
* Appreciation of nephrology and toxicology recommendations.

The patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation, and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, acidosis, and electrolyte and fluid disorders.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, and calcium gluconate.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 26.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 245 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is <0.01. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 5,304 mL and output of 320 mL. The patient is receiving dialysis and has a dialysis catheter in place.

The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 737 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient has a fever and tachycardia, which could be indicative of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation and ventilation are being supported by mechanical ventilation, but the patient's respiratory status could deteriorate if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is receiving dialysis, which could indicate worsening renal function.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are slightly abnormal, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other electrolyte-related complications.
5. Infection: The patient has a dialysis catheter in place, which could increase the risk of infection.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be indicative of delirium, which could worsen if the patient's condition deteriorates.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient's underlying medical conditions and potential complications require close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, who presented with altered mental status. He was found to have ethylene glycol toxicity, which was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD) and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 737 mL.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which was treated with sedation, HD, and hydration. The patient's blood pressure is 123/60 mmHg, and his heart rate is 66 beats per minute.
* Neurological: The patient is agitated, not following commands, and has oxalate crystals in his urine. He has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20.5 mg/dL.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.5 mmol/L, which was treated with HD and correction of academia.
* Infections: The patient has a leukocytosis of 26.7 cells/mm³, and a lung infiltrate on chest X-ray. He was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole for possible pneumonia.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a nasogastric tube with blood, and was treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and lung injury.
* Cardiac complications such as atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
* Electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
* Infections such as pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and other systemic complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation to manage the patient's respiratory and neurological status.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider treatment with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers to manage atrial fibrillation.
* Continue hemodialysis and CVVH to manage the patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
* Consider treatment with antibiotics for possible infections such as pneumonia.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider treatment with proton pump inhibitors for possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Consider social work and psychiatry involvement to address the patient's depression and substance abuse."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue CVVH with goal to remove 1L negative today
   - q6h electrolytes check
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switched collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - returned to NSR [**11-27**] to [**11-28**]
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - re-place NG, if still w/blood, call GI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, which can lead to further kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output. The patient also has hypocalcemia, which can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has a leukocytosis of 40, which can indicate an underlying infection. The patient's urine culture is positive for bacteria, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further bleeding and hypovolemic shock.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including propofol, fomepizole, and heparin, which can interact with each other and lead to adverse effects.
9. Sedation-related complications: The patient is sedated with propofol, which can lead to respiratory depression and other sedation-related complications.
10. Imaging-related complications: The patient has a history of falls, which can lead to imaging-related complications, such as bleeding or infection.

To prevent or manage these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team, including regular assessments of his respiratory, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal status. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and adjusted as needed. The patient's nutritional status should be assessed and managed to prevent malnutrition. The patient's medication regimen should be closely monitored for potential interactions and side effects."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - re-place NG, if still w/blood, call GI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male who was admitted with altered mental status, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity. He has a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is unclear in etiology. His blood pressure is 133/64 mmHg, and his heart rate is 83 bpm.
* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemodialysis (HD).
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 6.0 mmol/L. His calcium level is 8.0 mg/dL, and his magnesium level is 1.6 mg/dL.
* Neurological status: The patient is agitated and not following commands. He has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a leukocytosis of 40,000 cells/μL, and his urine culture shows moderate bacteria. He is receiving ceftriaxone and metronidazole for suspected pneumonia and aspiration.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place, and he has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis and suspected pneumonia, he is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving CRRT and HD. He is at risk for further renal damage.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and he is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is unclear in etiology, and he is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of depression and substance abuse, which may increase his risk for developing infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and he is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
8. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is worsening, and he is at risk for further neurological deterioration.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure.
2. Antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and aspiration.
3. Anti-arrhythmic medication for atrial fibrillation.
4. Sedation for agitation and anxiety.
5. Pain management for the patient's pain.
6. Nutrition support for the patient's nutritional needs.
7. Monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and cardiovascular status.
8. Consideration of further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head, to evaluate for potential causes of the patient's altered mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 96.4 kg male who is admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, altered mental status, and a history of adverse drug event (ADE) and acidosis. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 551 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 133/64 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being considered for cardioversion and anticoagulation. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L and a calcium level of 8.0 mg/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate, indicating acute kidney injury. The patient's liver function tests are also abnormal, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

The patient's diagnosis is acute renal failure, altered mental status, and acidosis. The patient is at risk for developing complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and increased mortality.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and elevated respiratory rate suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Respiratory failure can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and increased mortality.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias can lead to cardiac arrest, heart failure, and increased mortality.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and decreased bicarbonate levels suggest the possibility of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased mortality.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia, suggest the possibility of electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and increased mortality.
* Infection: The patient's altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection. Infection can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased mortality.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, acid-base disturbance, and acute renal failure. He has a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. The patient presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. He was treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current condition is:

* Sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation
* Receiving CVVH and fomepizole
* Has a hard collar on due to a recent fall
* Has atrial fibrillation, which has resolved with sedation and hydration
* Has elevated WBC, which may be due to ethylene glycol toxicity or infection
* Has a LUL infiltrate on CXR
* Has a history of cocaine abuse and depression

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Infection, particularly pneumonia, due to the patient's history of substance abuse and altered mental status
* Continued acid-base disturbance and electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure and need for ongoing dialysis
* Respiratory failure and need for continued mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, due to atrial fibrillation
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or brain damage, due to ethylene glycol toxicity
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or bleeding, due to the patient's history of substance abuse and altered mental status
* Thromboembolic complications, such as DVT or PE, due to the patient's immobility and history of substance abuse

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity
* Elevated WBC and lactate levels
* Normal BUN and creatinine levels
* Elevated potassium levels
* Normal troponin-T and CK-MB levels
* Elevated ALT and AST levels
* Normal albumin and LDH levels
* Elevated calcium and magnesium levels

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued CVVH and fomepizole
* Monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status
* Repletion of calcium and magnesium
* Weaning of sedation and propofol
* Follow-up with nephrology and toxicology services
* Consideration of antibiotics for potential infection
* Follow-up with psychiatry and social work services for depression and substance abuse."

   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase
   .
   #UGI bleeding: blood from NG tube before patient self-d/c.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity. He has been treated with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD), which has resolved the acidosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which has improved with HD and correction of academia.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has intrinsic renal disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an unclear etiology for atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with sedation, HD, and hydration.
4. Elevated lactate: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, which may be due to ethylene glycol toxicity or infection. A lumbar puncture (LP) was unremarkable, but a CXR showed a left upper lobe infiltrate.
5. Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate: The patient has leukocytosis and a left upper lobe infiltrate on CXR, with no bandemia.
6. Coccaine abuse/Depression: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and depression, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.
7. UGI bleeding: The patient has had blood from his nasogastric (NG) tube, which may be due to bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract.
8. FEN: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to his altered mental status and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hyperkalemia and acidosis may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which can progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGI bleeding may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hemorrhagic shock and other complications.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue hemodialysis and CVVH until the patient's ethylene glycol levels are <20.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and pH levels closely, and give bicarbonate as needed.
3. Continue IVF and fomepizole as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's lactate levels and consider further workup if they remain elevated.
5. Consider imaging studies, such as a CT scan, to rule out underlying infections or other causes of the patient's symptoms.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist and a cardiologist to further manage the patient's acute renal failure and atrial fibrillation.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedation and analgesia as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:  Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased
   osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity.  anion gap
   around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene glycol. Treated
   w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of HD, HD, and CVVH. Anion gap to 14 this
   morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line is placed and patient will receive HD, may need CVVH
   after that overnight
   - ethylene glycol level is 314, resend the levels post dialysis (send
   to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**])
   - need to recheck lytes (gap) and pH post dialysis and give bicarb as
   needed
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 50 mg IV q4h and pyridoxine 50 mg
   q6h for 24 hours
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during dialysis.
   - IVF prn
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K is 6 with tented T waves. K improved w/HD and
   correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr increased to 2.5 this
   am. Nephrology following. Given IVF.
   - appreciate nephrology recs
   - continue IVF
   - pm electrolytes
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  CT head at OSH without sig
   abnormalities and poor quality neck films.
   - switch collar to [**Location (un) 239**]-J until able to clinically clear
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear etiology. Rapid ventricular response
   resolved throughout the night w/sedation, HD, hydration.  B-blocker
   held due to recent cocaine use, holding off on CCB for now given this
   is probably physiologic response to keep his CO adequate.
   - IVF prn
   - echo
   .
   # Elevated lactate:  Could be falsely elevated due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  However given elevated WBC to 40 needs to rule out
   infection.  LP unremarkable as above.  CXR with LUL infiltrate.
   Improved this am when checked w/green top tube, although when checked
   w/abg was stable, slightly elevated. UA w/moderate bacteria but no WBC.
   - Ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for PNA, most likely aspiration
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Leukocytosis/LUL infiltrate:  No bandemia.  LUL CXR as above.  Other
   workup as above.
   - trend with diff
   - CTX and flagyl
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   - will check CK.
   - needs social work and psychiatry involvement once out of acute phase

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected ethylene glycol toxicity, and multiple comorbidities.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Continued acid-base disturbances: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis has improved, but close monitoring of electrolytes and pH levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased, and he is at risk for further kidney damage. Close monitoring of renal function and potential need for dialysis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level has improved with hemodialysis, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out with further testing and antibiotics.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid ventricular response has resolved with sedation and hydration, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary to prevent further bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for seizures or neurological damage needs to be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes, pH levels, and renal function closely.
* Continue hemodialysis until the patient's ethylene glycol levels are below 20.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as necessary.
* Consider further imaging studies to rule out underlying infections or other complications.
* Involve social work and psychiatry in the patient's care once he is out of the acute phase.
* Consider further interventions to prevent further gastrointestinal bleeding."

 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Lactic acidosis and AG have normalized.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   Ethlyene glycol intoxication:  osmolar gap is down to 4, but will
   continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may
   still be present and leach out.  Await 3:00AM level, if high, recheck,
   if <20, can stop fomepizole.
   Rigidity:  Unclear if this was agitation.   He was also on a  muscle
   relaxant which has been stopped - this can cause withdrawl.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Will continue CVVH
   for now to remove fluid.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O ADVERSE DRUG EVENT (ADR, ADE, MEDICATION TOXICITY)
 .H/O ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Lactic acidosis and AG have normalized.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   Ethlyene glycol intoxication:  osmolar gap is down to 4, but will
   continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may
   still be present and leach out.  Await 3:00AM level, if high, recheck,
   if <20, can stop fomepizole.
   Rigidity:  Unclear if this was agitation.   He was also on a  muscle
   relaxant which has been stopped - this can cause withdrawl.

* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): Will continue CVVH for now to remove fluid.
* Altered mental status (not delirium): H/O adverse drug event (ADE, medication toxicity).
* Acidosis, metabolic: Lactic acidosis and AG have normalized.
* Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: Ethylene glycol intoxication: Osmolar gap is down to 4, but will continue fomepizole until level is <20 as if it is fat soluble, it may still be present and leach out.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium, potassium, and phosphorus levels are abnormal, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated, which can lead to metabolic acidosis.
4. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of seizures.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, which can lead to respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrolyte imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  anion gap  around 30 represent sig metabolism of ethylene
   glycol. Treated w/bicarb, fomepizole Q4h b/c of  CVVH. Anion gap to 12
   this morning and acidosis is resolved after HD and CVVH.  Osmolar gap
   closed
   - CVVH until Ethylene glycol <20
   - monitor electrolytes post d/c CVVH
   - Replete Ca, Mg aggressively
   .
   # Altered Mental status:  Most likely initially due to ethylene glycol
   toxicity, now with sedation overnight for mechanical ventilation.
   Urine shows oxalate crystals.  CT head at OSH did not show any acute
   changes.  LP was within normal limits at OSH.
   - femoral HD line in placd and patient will  continue to receive CVVH
   until EG cleared. [**Month (only) 11**] need HD afterward if UO does not restart
   - ethylene glycol level on presentation 314, trending levels [**Hospital1 **] to TID
   (send to [**Hospital1 1910**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2534**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2535**]). [**11-28**] 3am level was 32.
   -q6h  lytes while on CVVH
   - thiamine 100 mg daily, folic acid 1mg daily and pyridoxine 100mg
   daily
   - fomipezole 10 mg/kg q4h during CVVH
   -continue propofol, weaning as tolerated, titrate for agitation.
   - appreciate toxicology recs
   - appreciate nephrology recs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  K of 6 with tented T waves on presentation. K improved
   w/HD and correction of academia.
   - to follow lytes after CVVH finished
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  With normal BUN suggestive for intrinsic renal
   disease secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity. Cr stable in low 3s.
   Nephrology following. Given IVF yesterday with lasix 120mg IV with only
   50 cc UO.
   - appreciate nephrology recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected ethylene glycol toxicity, and multiple comorbidities. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory acidosis. He has a history of depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity, resolved with bicarbonate, fomepizole, and CVVH.
2. Hyperkalemia, improved with HD and correction of academia.
3. Acute renal failure, with normal BUN and stable Cr levels, likely secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity.
4. Atrial fibrillation, unclear etiology, resolved with sedation, HD, and hydration.
5. Elevated WBC, likely due to ethylene glycol toxicity, with a normal lactate level.
6. Leukocytosis and LUL infiltrate, with no bandemia, and a normal UA.
7. Coccaine abuse and depression, with a need for social work and psychiatry involvement.
8. UGI bleeding, with blood from NG tube before patient self-removed, none since admission.
9. FEN, NPO for now, with concern for ileus, and a need for nutrition consult for TF.
10. Prophylaxis, including sc heparin, pneumoboots, and PPI.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and LUL infiltrate may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may recur, and his underlying cardiac condition may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest and mortality.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and suspected ethylene glycol toxicity may lead to permanent neurological damage, including seizures, coma, or even death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's UGI bleeding and concern for ileus may lead to gastrointestinal perforation, bleeding, or obstruction.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hyperkalemia and acidosis may lead to hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrest.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and address these potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of poisoning/overdose. He has been receiving treatment for acute renal failure, altered mental status, adverse drug event, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He has a double-lumen PICC line in place and has received various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and sedatives.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and elevated FiO2 may increase the risk of VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs): The patient's PICC line and arterial line may be at risk for CRBSIs, particularly with the prolonged use of central lines.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, may be at risk for imbalance due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and fever may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient's elevated PEEP and FiO2 may increase the risk of pulmonary edema, particularly if his lung compliance is compromised.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's prolonged use of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Wound infections: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of central lines may increase the risk of wound infections.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent or mitigate these complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of depression, prior suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, who presented with altered mental status. He was found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity consistent with ethylene glycol toxicity. The patient's condition has improved, with electrolytes normalized and EG levels below 20, but his creatinine continues to rise, indicating an intrarenal problem.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating kidney damage. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is clinically fluid overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, and cardiac failure.
3. Electrolyte disturbances: The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, but he may still experience disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypercalcemia.
4. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and is on antibiotics for a possible LUL infiltrate or aspiration pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has bilious drainage and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may persist, and he may experience seizures, stroke, or other neurological complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status is being monitored, but he may still experience arrhythmias, hypertension, or cardiac failure.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient is on a ventilator and may experience respiratory failure, pneumonia, or other respiratory complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Hemodialysis to manage his acute kidney injury and fluid overload.
2. Weaning off Propofol and sedation to assess his mental status and potential extubation.
3. Monitoring his electrolytes and repleting as needed.
4. Following up with nephrology and toxicology recommendations.
5. Continuing to monitor his mental status and potential psych consult.
6. Managing his gastrointestinal bleeding and potential UGI bleeding.
7. Monitoring his cardiac and respiratory status.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old man who ingested ethylene glycol and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/70 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 3.9 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving dialysis and has a PICC line in place. He is also receiving medications to manage his respiratory and cardiovascular status, including fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate that he is critically ill and requires continued close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue dialysis and to try to wean him off mechanical ventilation once his respiratory status improves.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued deterioration of his kidney function, which could lead to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Prolonged mechanical ventilation, which could lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to his electrolyte imbalances and medication use.
4. Infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia, which could be exacerbated by his immunosuppressed state.
5. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to his electrolyte imbalances and medication use.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to his altered coagulation profile and medication use.
7. Skin complications, such as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, due to his immobility and altered skin integrity.
8. Nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances, due to his altered nutritional status and medication use.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's status and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan:  37 y/o gentleman with depression, prior suicidal
   ideation and substance abuse presented with altered mental status.
   .
   # Acid/base disturbance:   Resolved.  Presented with Anion gap
   metabolic acidosis with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with
   ethylene glycol toxicity.  Osmol gap resolved, electrolytes normalized
   and EG levels below 20 so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine
   however continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is
   probably and intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - nephrology following
   - f/u renal recs - HD tomorrow?
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently weaning
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation and increased
   responsiveness (as per nursing staff) with weaning. Will continue to
   wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of extubation today if
   successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Restraints by bedside
   -          Haldol prn agitation
   -          Patient will need psych consult and sitter when conscious
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from ongoing HD today both for renal failure and
   volume overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as
   needed with HD.
   - speak w/nephrology RE likely long-term need for dialysis
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia:  Aspiration pneumonia on cxr, c/w history, elev
   WBC, low grade temps.  WBC trending down. Low grade fever on occasion
   over the last 3 days could be due to resolving pna or UTI (see below).
   Was on ceftriaxone and flagyl to but switched to levoquin while pt on
   CVVH and receiving frequent doses of IV calcium b/c Ceftriaxone
   precipitates with calcium. CVVH d/c now, so can re-start Ceftriaxone,
   which may cover UTI better.
   - d/c flagyl, do not need to cover anaerobes in setting of new
   aspiration pneumonia.
   - follow BCx
   - follow CXR
   - trend fever curve
   # Positive UA: Has foley since admission. Has been febrile on Levoquin,
   Flagyl. To change antibiotics to Ceftriaxone, may cover UTI better.
   - follow UCx, tailor antibiotics based on results.
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved
   .
   # Cocaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych when extubateed
   .
   #UGI bleeding: OG to suction was bringing back bilious drainage; On
   PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Clamped yesterday w/out problem.
   - [**Hospital1 **] to QD
   - OG to clamp
   - to monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. OG clamped.  PO when extubated as
   mental status allows.  Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult
   nutrition if patient is not able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by
   tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are noted:

1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been elevated to 101.1°F, which may indicate an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or UTI.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been altered due to toxicity, although it's unclear what type of toxicity. The patient was taking a number of pain and psych meds, including Percocet, which may have contributed to the altered mental status.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has made very little urine and creatinine levels have been steadily increasing, indicating intrinsic renal failure. The patient will likely need ongoing hemodialysis (HD) to manage the renal failure and volume overload.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which is evident on chest X-ray. The patient's WBC count is trending down, and low-grade fever may be due to resolving pneumonia or UTI.
5. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture (UCx pending), and the antibiotics may need to be tailored based on the results.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been elevated, but have since resolved.
7. Acid-base disturbance: The patient initially presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis, which has since resolved.
8. Fluid overload: The patient appears clinically fluid overloaded, and caution should be taken with IV fluids.
9. Sedation: The patient is still sedated and intubated, and will need to be weaned off sedation and extubated as soon as possible.
10. Psychiatric concerns: The patient has a history of depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse, and will need a psych consult and sitter when extubated.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Hemodialysis (HD) to manage acute renal failure and volume overload.
2. Weaning off sedation and extubation as soon as possible.
3. Tailoring antibiotics based on the results of the UCx.
4. Monitoring electrolytes and repleting as needed.
5. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis.
6. Consulting with nephrology and psychiatry to address the patient's underlying medical and psychiatric conditions.
7. Reassessing the patient's mental status and adjusting treatment accordingly.
8. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and adjusting IV fluids as needed.
9. Considering imaging if unable to clinically clear the patient's altered mental status.
10. Providing social work support and referrals to address the patient's psychiatric and substance abuse concerns."

   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Acid/base disturbance:   Presented with Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   with increased osmolarity to 373 consistent with ethylene glycol
   toxicity.  Osmole gap resolved, electrolytes normalized and EG levels
   below 20 yesterday so CVVHD and fomepizole stopped. Creatinine however
   continues to rise and he will likely need HD as this is probably and
   intrarenal problem caused by ethylene glycol.
   - HD today
   - monitor electrolytes (labs drawn during HD)
   - f/u renal recs
   -f/u toxicology recs
   -caution with IVF as patient appears clinically fluid overloaded.
   # Altered Mental status:  Likely due to toxicity, although patient was
   also taking a number of pain and psych meds including percocet.  CT
   head and LP at OSH did not show any acute changes.  Currently on
   Propofol drip with intermittent episodes of agitation with weaning.
   Will continue to wean off Propofol as tolerated with hopes of
   extubation if successful.
   -          HD today
   -          Continue to wean Propofol as tolerated
   -          Patient will likely need psych consult and sitter when
   conscious
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:  resolved, on HD today
   .
   # Acute renal failure:  Making very little urine and Cr steadily
   increasing, intrinsic renal is the key issue. Renal service feels
   patient would benefit from HD today both for renal failure and volume
   overload. Will continue to follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   with HD. Given patient is on Propofol will need to monitor closely for
   hypotension during HD.
   - follow nephrology recs
   - monitor electrolytes and follow Cr for improvement
   .
   # s/p fall: Currently on hard collar.  Will wean of sedation will
   clinically clear prior to removal.
   - consider imaging if unable to clinically clear
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm with
   stable rates. Echo does not show structural abnormalities.
   .
   # Elevated WBC:  Trending down nicely. Low grade fever on occasion over
   the last 2 days but otherwise no clear indication of worsening
   infection. Currently on ceftriaxone and flagyl to cover for LUL
   infiltrate ?PNA, most likely aspiration to complete a 5 day course
   - follow BCx
   - follow UCx
   -trend fever curve
   .
   # Coccaine abuse/Depression:
   -          social work following, appreciate recs and support
   -          will need psych
   .
   #UGI bleeding: currently OG to suction bringing back bilious drainage;
   On PPI. Has not had any bloody drainage. Will clamp and today and give
   something from below.
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - OG to clamp
   -monitor
   .
   # FEN:  Has been NPO for 3 days. Will clamp OG and watch for BM and
   movement from below.  This way we can feel comfortable giving PO.
   Replete electrolytes. Will need to consult nutrition if patient is not
   able to be extubated or taking OG feeds by tomorrow.

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with altered mental status and was found to have ethylene glycol toxicity, which has been treated with fomepizole and CVVHD. He has ongoing issues with hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and fluid overload. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a Propofol drip, and is being weaned off sedation. He has a history of depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is steadily increasing, and he is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is clinically fluid overloaded, and his fluid balance is out of control. He is at risk of developing pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever and is at risk of developing a nosocomial infection, particularly pneumonia.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of depression and suicidal ideation, and he is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to his intoxication.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of UGI bleeding and is at risk of developing further bleeding or perforation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk of developing cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid intake accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his electrolyte replacement as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his dialysis schedule as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedation regimen as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust his nutritional regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular function and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust his ventilator settings as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old individual admitted to the ICU due to poisoning/overdose, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.4°C (101.1°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm
* Blood pressure: 156/81 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Weight: 96.4 kg (admission weight: 95 kg)

The patient has been experiencing fever, and cultures were taken from blood, sputum, and urine. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are not responding to stimuli. They are receiving propofol infusion for sedation and respiratory support with a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7-13.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6-11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 185-222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.3-4.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26-28 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94-110 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Liver function tests: mildly elevated
* Renal function tests: mildly elevated

The patient has a history of poisoning/overdose, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. They are at risk for developing complications such as:

* Sepsis due to the presence of fever and positive blood cultures
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's tachypnea and hypoxia
* Renal failure due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's altered mental status and respiratory support
* Infection due to the presence of a dialysis catheter and arterial line

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for suspected sepsis
* Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute renal failure
* Respiratory support with a ventilator
* Electrolyte replacement and monitoring
* Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and respiratory function

   complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal failure with
   mental status as primary limiting factor contributing to persistent
   respiratory failure.  He has had continued issues of fever through to
   this morning and slow return to organized mental status.  He does,
   however, have good tolerance of ventilatory wean with favorable
   pulmonary mechanics and reassuring blood gases.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo male admitted with Ethylene Glycol ingestion and now with course
   complicated by persistent respiratory failure and renal failure with
   mental status as primary limiting factor contributing to persistent
   respiratory failure.  He has had continued issues of fever through to
   this morning and slow return to organized mental status.  He does,
   however, have good tolerance of ventilatory wean with favorable
   pulmonary mechanics and reassuring blood gases.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   -Levoflox/Flagyl continuting
   -Patient continues to be able to follow simple commands but with slow
   response time
   -Secretions moderate and thin
   -Patient with favorable RSBI on [**4-30**] which is not specific for success
   with extubation
   -Extubation today
   -Tachypnea will be evaluated with ABG
   2) .H/O POISONING / OVERDOSE, OTHER-
   -Dialysis per Renal schedule with plan for dialysis tomorrow
   3)  RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Will pursue cultures from catheter
   -Dialysis tomorrow
   4)  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   -Folate/Thiamine
   -Propofol to wean to off today
   -Move to extubation today
   -Would not expect altered mental status from initial ingestion
   -Seroquel PRN following extubation or if agitated peri-extubation

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted with ethylene glycol ingestion and is currently experiencing respiratory failure and renal failure. He has had a fever since admission and has been slow to return to organized mental status.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm
* Blood pressure: 151/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) and arterial line in place

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 551 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His blood gases are within normal limits, with a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 99 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.7-13.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 29.6-30.5%
* Platelet count (Plt): 185-222 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 3.3-4.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 5.1-26 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94-110 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): ETT at 6-8 cm above carina, PICC in place and OGT in good position

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute: Levofloxacin and metronidazole will continue, and the patient will be weaned off propofol today. Extubation is planned for today.
* Renal failure, acute: Dialysis will be performed tomorrow.
* Altered mental status: Folate and thiamine will be administered, and propofol will be weaned off today. The patient will be moved to extubation today.
* Poisoning/overdose: Dialysis will be performed tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are possible complications.
* Renal failure: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are possible complications.
* Altered mental status: Delirium, seizures, and stroke are possible complications.
* Infection: Sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are possible complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory and renal function closely and to adjust his treatment plan as needed."
