You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a multi-lumen central venous catheter inserted at 12:45 AM on January 20, 2110. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of pulmonary edema. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 73 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 28 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to exercise.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction or damage, which may be related to the patient's underlying cancer or other medical conditions.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, may become imbalanced, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
6. VAP: The patient's presence of a multi-lumen central venous catheter and pulmonary edema may increase the risk of VAP.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and presence of a central venous catheter may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may lead to stress ulceration, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient.  Differential includes
   pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary
   embolism, but most likely etiology is pulmonary edema from vasogenic
   leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - consider chest CTA if hypoxia does not resolve but no empiric
   anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Other possibilities
   include viral hepatitis and cholecystitis.
   - check RUQ U/S
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has been receiving IL-2 therapy, which is a known complication of vasogenic leak, leading to pulmonary edema. She has been managed with non-invasive ventilation and diuresis, but her condition has not improved significantly. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and RLE edema. She is also at risk for DVT and has a history of depression, anxiety, and pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure and decreased oxygenation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. DVT: The patient's RLE edema and history of pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic metastatic masses put her at risk for DVT.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases her risk for bleeding complications.
5. Metabolic Contraction Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and respiratory depression.
6. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may indicate an underlying pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider a chest CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
3. Continue diuresis and consider a lasix bolus if the patient's CVP increases.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue to trend the patient's liver enzymes and consider further evaluation if indicated.
6. Consider empiric anticoagulation if the patient's hypoxia does not resolve.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further evaluation if necessary.
8. Consider a multidisciplinary approach to the patient's care, including consultation with a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and infectious disease specialist."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema
   from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Other less
   likely possiblities include pna and PE.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - continue non-rebreather
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - anticipate that respiratory status will gradually improve with time
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Negative RUQ U/S on
   [**2110-1-20**].
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic
   metastatic masses.  No DVT on LENIs.
   - continue to follow
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on
   [**2110-1-17**].  Will defer further mgmnt to heme onc.
   - f/u heme onc reccs
   # Depression/Anxiety:  continue home meds
   # Pain control:  continue oxycodone
   # Smoking history:  continue buproprion, nicotine patch
   # FEN: regular diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has been intermittently tiring and recovering. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg. She has a history of pulmonary edema from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction. She has a history of depression, anxiety, and pain, and is being managed with home medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration. The high A-a gradient and pulmonary edema from vasogenic leak may worsen her respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of arrhythmias.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal dysfunction may worsen her electrolyte imbalance and increase her risk of acute kidney injury.
6. Depression and anxiety: The patient's depression and anxiety may worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of complications.
7. Pain management: The patient's pain management needs to be optimized to prevent further deterioration.
8. Smoking history: The patient's smoking history may increase her risk of respiratory complications and other health problems.
9. FEN: The patient's FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition) management needs to be optimized to prevent further complications.
10. Code status: The patient's code status is full code, which means that she is willing to receive life-sustaining interventions in the event of a cardiac arrest."

   pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary
   embolism among other etiologies.  IL-2 associated with pulmonary edema
   [**1-13**] vasogenic leakage but can also be cardiotoxic.   Patient also
   received lasix on the floor with good UOP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She was initially managed with non-invasive ventilation and intermittent arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. The patient's respiratory status has remained stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on non-rebreather oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 40 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and thrombocytopenia. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's urine output has been good, and she has received diuretic therapy with Lasix.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's high A-a gradient suggests that she may have pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. The patient will undergo further evaluation with an echocardiogram and chest computed tomography (CT) scan.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be secondary to chemotherapy or infection. She will undergo further evaluation with a pan-culture (blood and urine) and a test for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff).
3. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes may be elevated due to the IL-2 chemotherapy or other causes such as viral hepatitis or cholecystitis. She will undergo further evaluation with a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) and consideration of further infectious disease evaluation.
4. RLE edema: The patient's right lower extremity edema may be secondary to pelvic compression of the iliac vein from pelvic metastatic masses. She will undergo further evaluation with a lower extremity ultrasound (LEUS) and consideration of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Melanoma: The patient has a history of melanoma and has received IL-2 chemotherapy. She will defer further management to her hematologist-oncologist.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which can worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's RLE edema and high A-a gradient may indicate the presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's systolic heart failure and elevated liver enzymes may indicate the presence of cardiac complications, which can worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions that require careful management and monitoring. The potential medical complications that can arise from her conditions highlight the importance of prompt and effective treatment to prevent worsening of her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema
   from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Other less
   likely possiblities include pna and PE.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - continue non-rebreather
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - anticipate that respiratory status will gradually improve with time
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Negative RUQ U/S on
   [**2110-1-20**].
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic
   metastatic masses.  No DVT on LENIs.
   - continue to follow
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on
   [**2110-1-17**].  Will defer further mgmnt to heme onc.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has a history of IL-2 therapy, which has caused pulmonary edema and vasogenic leak. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and vanc/zosyn antibiotics. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests, and elevated lactate levels. She has a history of RLE edema, which is secondary to pelvic compression of the iliac vein from pelvic metastatic masses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is expected to gradually improve with time, but she is at risk for further complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to chemotherapy or infection, and she is at risk for developing a secondary infection.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may be secondary to IL-2 therapy, but further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, which may be secondary to her underlying disease or other factors such as sepsis or hypoperfusion.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's RLE edema may be secondary to pelvic compression of the iliac vein, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Nutritional compromise: The patient's nutritional status is compromised due to her underlying disease and treatment, which may lead to further complications such as malnutrition or cachexia.
7. Psychological complications: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, which may be exacerbated by her underlying disease and treatment.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU. Further evaluation and management of her underlying disease and complications are needed to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall outcome."
