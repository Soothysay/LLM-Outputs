You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, bronchoesophageal fistula, and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She was intubated at the onset of her admission and is currently being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55 beats per minute, blood pressure of 91/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine levels, indicating possible sepsis. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, including cefepime, flagyl, and clindamycin.

The patient's radiology results show a large lung abscess with a bronchus communicating with the distal esophagus, which is concerning for a possible malignant process. She is being evaluated for possible GI intervention, including EGD, biopsy, and stent placement.

The patient's medical conditions include tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, and is being managed with HISS for glycemic control.

The patient's code status is DNR, and she is on ventilator support. She is scheduled to undergo stent placement today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the lung abscess and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's hypertension and tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's esophageal disease and possible stent placement
* Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to the patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility
* Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis due to the patient's type 2 diabetes and HISS management

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her management plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."

 BRADYCARDIA
 TRACHEOBRONCHIAL DISEASE, OTHER (TRACHEA / BRONCHUS, INCLUDING
   INJURY)
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has falling Hct. Has received many fluids, but has
   had a 24 hr drop from 39.4
25.9 in the setting of a lung lesion.
   --repeat Hct
   --check Hct q 6 hr
   --hemolysis and iron labs
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Recent
   presentation with weight loss, coughing and vomiting post ingestion of
   food with large R- sided consolidation/mass in right lung involving
   esophagus on CT chest, barium study demonstrates tracheo-esophageal
   fistula.  Failed stent placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **]
   Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU for supportive care prior to
   attempted intervention by GI with EGD and stent placement.
   Intermittent hypotension overnight responding to fluid boluses.

   #Hypotenion -- concerning for sepsis vs cardiac etiology including
   ischemia, compromised cardiac outpt, pericardial effusion given extent
   and location of lung process.
   --Place central line for CVP monitoring. A-line for invasive BP
   montoring.
   --Aggressive IVF  to maintain MAPS > 60, CVP 10-12, u/o > 30. trend

   --Pan cx and broaden antibx adding vanco to cefepime and clinda.
   --TTE to eval for possible RV compression given location of mass or
   pericardial effusion.  Ces and 12 lead ECG.
   # Respiratory Failure-continue full vent support, follow abg
   # Pneumonia vs mass with TE fistula
concern for possible eroding mass
   with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with significant necrosis.
   Given new hypotension, concern for new VAP as well.  Potential surgical
   options were discussed with pt
s family and given probable high
   operative mortality, not felt to be an acceptable option.  We continue
   to manage medically with plan for GI to perform EGD for both further
   diagnosis and therapeutic intervention with stent iwhen pt is stable to
   tolerate from HD standpoint.  Continue Cefepime and Clinda adding vanco
   given high concern for sepsis/VAP. Recx.  Sx for secretion clearance.
   Keep NPO, no NGT
   # Anemia--likely dilutional, w/o evidence of active bleeding,  will
   trend h/h, keep type and cross, check hemolysis labs and retic ct

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She is currently intubated and sedated, with a diagnosis of pneumonia, aspiration, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension, with a blood pressure of 91/56 mmHg, and is moderately responsive to fluid boluses.

The patient has a complex medical history, including a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is communicating with the distal esophagus, and a cavitary lung abscess/mass in the right lung. She has undergone attempted stent placement, but it failed, and she is now being managed medically with a plan for gastrointestinal (GI) intervention, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and possible stent placement.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 30 IU/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 48 IU/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is dependent on mechanical ventilation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to dilutional anemia, but it may also be related to bleeding or hemolysis.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac ischemia or pericardial effusion.
5. VAP: The patient's recent intubation and mechanical ventilation make her at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase her risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including aspiration and necrosis.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes and electrolyte imbalance may increase her risk of metabolic complications, including hyperglycemia and hypokalemia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels closely.
3. Consider placing a central line for CVP monitoring and an arterial line for invasive blood pressure monitoring.
4. Continue antibiotic therapy with cefepime and clindamycin, and add vancomycin for additional anaerobic coverage.
5. Plan for GI intervention, including EGD and possible stent placement, to diagnose and treat the bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
7. Consider placing a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach and prevent aspiration.
8. Monitor the patient's skin integrity closely and take measures to prevent skin breakdown and pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has falling Hct. Has received many fluids, but has
   had a 24 hr drop from 39.4
25.9 in the setting of a lung lesion.
   --repeat Hct

   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, bronchoesophageal fistula, and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She is currently admitted to the ICU for management of sepsis, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 91/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.4 K/uL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 237 IU/L, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25.9 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.4 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by the lung abscess/mass and bronchoesophageal fistula.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 91/56 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. The possible etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication-related, and intubation-related.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
4. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is a communication between the trachea and esophagus.
5. Cavitary lung abscess/mass: The patient has a cavitary lung abscess/mass, which is a collection of pus in the lung.
6. Anemia: The patient has a falling hemoglobin level of 25.9 g/dL, which is likely caused by the lung lesion.
7. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which may contribute to her cardiovascular disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue fluid boluses for a goal of urine output >30 mL/hr and mean arterial pressure >65 mmHg.
2. Check urine lytes for FeNa.
3. Obtain an arterial line to assess delta PP.
4. Obtain a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and mixed venous O2.
5. Obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess dynamics of the heart.
6. Continue volume-cycled assist control pending EGD.
7. Continue midazolam and fentanyl infusions.
8. Obtain a CT esophogram and barium swallow to further evaluate the bronchoesophageal fistula and lung abscess/mass.
9. Plan for GI intervention, including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent placement.
10. Continue cefepime and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
11. Discontinue flagyl and start vancomycin for more gram-positive coverage.
12. NPO for EGD in the morning.
13. Follow-up with GI/ERCP.
14. Follow-up pathology from Hospital6 300.
15. Follow-up cultures.

The patient's code status is DNR, OK for CVL and pressors, which was confirmed with her HCP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.

   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes who was transferred to the ICU from an OSH for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.5°C, HR 53 bpm, BP 94/52 mmHg, RR 12 breaths/min, SpO2 98%.
* Respiratory support: Intubated and receiving volume-cycled assist control ventilation with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 13 mmHg, total in 8,630 mL, total out 1,246 mL, with a balance of 7,384 mL.
* Laboratory results: WBC 13.9 K/uL, Hct 25.9%, Plt 183 K/uL, Cr 0.4 mg/dL, TCO2 25 mmHg, Glucose 111 mg/dL, and other labs as indicated.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Bronchoesophageal fistula
* Pneumonia, aspiration
* Impaired skin integrity
* Anemia
* Hypertension
* Hyperlipidemia
* Type 2 diabetes

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
* Check urine lytes for FeNa.
* Obtain an arterial line to assess delta PP.
* Obtain a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and mixed venous O2.
* Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
* Continue volume-cycled assist control ventilation pending EGD.
* Continue midazolam and fentanyl infusions.
* Continue cefepime and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage.
* Discontinue flagyl and start vancomycin for more gram-positive coverage.
* NPO for EGD in the morning.
* Follow-up with GI/ERCP.
* Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**].
* Follow-up cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis from the lung abscess and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure from the bronchoesophageal fistula and pneumonia
* Cardiovascular instability from the lung mass and compression effects
* Anemia from blood loss and inadequate iron stores
* Hypovolemia from fluid loss and inadequate fluid resuscitation
* Hypoglycemia from inadequate glucose control
* Hypertension from uncontrolled blood pressure
* Hyperlipidemia from uncontrolled cholesterol levels
* Type 2 diabetes from uncontrolled glucose levels.

The patient's code status is not specified, and the disposition is planned for transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for further evaluation and management."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH for
   bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, hypovolemia, medication
   related and intubation related. Patient is moderately responsive to
   fluid boluses in the setting of infection, so the reason is most likely
   sepsis. Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond well to
   boluses, however, her urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be
   contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh
   the risks. Initially, secretions from her intubation tube was causing
   some hypotension, but upon suctioning, it improved. The compression
   effects of the lung mass can also be causing hypotension/bradycardia.
   --Continue fluid boluses for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   --Check urine lytes for FeNa.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   mixed venous O2.
   --Obtain TTE to assess dynamics of the heart.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this
   was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Plan to keep intubated tonight given plan for EGD in AM.
   - Continue volume cycled assist control pending EGD.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - D/C flagyl. Start Vanco for more gram positive coverage.
   - NPO for EGD in AM.
   - Follow-up with GI/ERCP
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Patient has falling Hct. Has received many fluids, but has
   had a 24 hr drop from 39.4
25.9 in the setting of a lung lesion.
   --repeat Hct
   --check Hct q 6 hr
   --hemolysis and iron labs
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal

   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Failed stent
   placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU
   for supportive care prior to attempted intervention by GI with EGD and
   stent placement.

   54 yo female with respiratory failure in setting of broncho-esophageal
   fistula and necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, remains hypotensive and
   bradycardic on dopamine.
   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full
   vent support, follow abg, ards net TV. We remain concerned about
   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full

   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury. She has been experiencing hypotension and bradycardia throughout her ICU stay, with minimal response to fluid boluses. The patient's cardiac function is likely normal, but the possibility of poor cardiac output or sepsis cannot be ruled out. She has also been experiencing respiratory failure, with a P/F ratio <300, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected polymicrobial pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be due to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may also be due to cardiogenic shock, which is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute lung injury and respiratory failure require close monitoring and treatment to prevent further deterioration.
4. Malignancy: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass may be due to a malignant process, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
5. Poor wound healing: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass may lead to poor wound healing, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to respiratory acidosis, which can have serious consequences if not treated promptly.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia may be due to cardiac arrhythmias, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrest and other complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac function closely.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and respiratory support as needed.
3. Continue to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected polymicrobial pneumonia.
4. Consider obtaining a central venous line to assess central venous oxygen saturation and to provide access for medication administration.
5. Consider obtaining a Swan-Ganz catheter to further assess cardiac function and to guide treatment decisions.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition and glycemic control, as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or pulmonologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiac and respiratory status."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct

   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an OSH for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.5°C, HR 53 bpm, BP 94/52 mmHg, RR 12 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Respiratory support: Intubated on CMV with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 50%.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardic, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, and hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 94/52 mmHg.
* Renal function: Urine output is dark, but there is no specific information on creatinine or blood urea nitrogen levels.
* Hematology: Hct is currently stable, but the patient has anemia.
* Coagulation: Platelet count is 183 K/uL, and there is no mention of any bleeding issues.
* Infection: Cultures from blood and urine are negative to date, but the patient has a lung abscess/mass, and there is concern about sepsis.
* Other: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, and there is concern about the underlying process being malignant.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's lung abscess/mass and the concern about sepsis, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension could be indicative of cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the lung abscess/mass.
* Bleeding: The patient has anemia, and there is concern about bleeding, especially given the intrathoracic process.
* Malignancy: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, and there is concern about the underlying process being malignant.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

* Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
* Get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
* Get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and central venous O2.
* Continue CMV for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
* Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
* Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if patient tolerates it.
* Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt.
* Monitor on telemetry and consider TTE today.
* Continue HISS.
* Hold home lisinopril for now.
* Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
* Consider tube feedings or TPN.
* Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**].
* f/u cultures.
* Monitor Hct and consider guaiac stools and type and screen.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and there are multiple potential medical complications that can arise. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust her care plan accordingly to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Failed stent
   placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU
   for supportive care prior to attempted intervention by GI with EGD and
   stent placement.
   Was hypotensive and bradycardic yesterday. Minimal response to IVF

   54 yo female with respiratory failure in setting of broncho-esophageal
   fistula and necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, remains hypotensive and
   bradycardic on dopamine.
   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full
   vent support, follow abg, ards net TV. We remain concerned about
   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today.
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  54 F DM, HTN, with resp failure in context
   of necrotizing pna vs mass and tracheoespoh fistula.  Failed stent
   placement attempt at [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from SICU
   for supportive care prior to attempted intervention by GI with EGD and
   stent placement.
   Was hypotensive and bradycardic yesterday. Minimal response to IVF

   hypotension.  Had TTE

   54 yo female with respiratory failure in setting of broncho-esophageal
   fistula and necrotizing pneumonia vs mass, remains hypotensive and
   bradycardic on dopamine.
   Unclear etiology for her hypotension.  Initial concern for sepsis vs
   cardiac etiology.  Sepsis seems less likely as she remains Af, no
   leukocytosis, nl lactate, good urine o/p. Her TTE was rather
   unimpressive and showed no tamponade/effusion or focal WMA and her
   systolic fx is preserved.  She remains warm and well perfused.  Her
   bradycardia remains concerning though unclear whether her hypotension
   is fully related to this or not.  She likely has component of sinus
   nodal dysfx though with rates > 40 she maintains a sinus rhythm.  Low
   suspicion for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   Agree with plan to check SVO2.  Wean dopa. If bradycardia is
   contributing to hypotension, would obtain ep consult and consider
   pacing.  Consider swan placement to further assess etiology of
   hypotension, though unlikely to change our management. Random [**Last Name (un) 402**] and
   stim test to r/o adrenal insuff. F/u pending cx data and continue
   broaden antibx coverage with vanco, cefepime, clinda. Continue full
   vent support, follow abg, ards net TV. We remain concerned about
   malignancy/eroding mass with superinfection vs  polymicrobial pna with
   significant necrosis.  Potential surgical options were discussed with
   pt
s family and given probable high operative mortality, not felt to be
   an acceptable option. We will arrange family meeting to continue to
   communicate and address goals of care. We attempt to manage medically
   with plan for GI to perform EGD for diagnosis (bx) and therapeutic
   intervention with stent if pt stabilizes to tolerate from HD
   standpoint.  Nutrition remains another prime issue as pt remains NPO,
   w/o  NGT in light of fistula. Will start TPN. ICU: picc line, IJ, PIV,
   replace a-line PPI, sq hep, glucose control via ssi, DNR
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Patient is critically ill,

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

1. The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital with bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
2. She has been intubated since admission and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a P/F ratio <300, indicating acute lung injury.
3. The patient has been hypotensive and bradycardic throughout her ICU stay, with a recent episode of decreased pressures that led to the cancellation of a planned procedure.
4. The patient's cardiac function is likely normal, with a left ventricular ejection fraction >55%. However, the right ventricle is not well seen on echocardiogram, and there is moderate tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula with a right lower lobe lung abscess, which is concerning for a possible malignant underlying process.
6. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hematocrit of 38%, and elevated lactate levels.
7. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.
8. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight, and she is being treated with antibiotics for possible anaerobic coverage.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension and bradycardia, sepsis is a possible diagnosis, especially with the presence of a bronchoesophageal fistula and lung abscess.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension could be due to cardiogenic shock, especially with the presence of a possible malignant underlying process.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute lung injury and bronchoesophageal fistula could lead to further respiratory failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if she experiences further bleeding or has an underlying bleeding disorder.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level could lead to further electrolyte imbalances if not monitored and managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's anemia with transfusions if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as bronchoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy, to determine the underlying cause of the bronchoesophageal fistula and lung abscess.
6. Continue antibiotics for possible anaerobic coverage.
7. Consider further surgical intervention, such as stent placement or surgical repair of the bronchoesophageal fistula, if the patient's condition stabilizes and she is able to tolerate the procedure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 53 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient has a history of tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. They are currently receiving mechanical ventilation and have a multi-lumen catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 12.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 183 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mg/dL
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. They have a code status of ""full code"" and are being managed with ICU-level care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but their respiratory rate is slow, which may indicate respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and their heart rate is slow, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is not documented, but their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not provided, which may indicate a risk of neurological complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure.
* Wound infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of wound infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --organize a family meeting.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess. Hypovolemia is
   less likely since she does not respond well to boluses, however, her
   urine is dark. The fentanyl drip can also be contributing to her
   vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Need to get an arterial line to assess delta PP.
   --Need to get a central venous line for access and to assess CVP and
   central venous O2.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. Given patient's significant smoking history,
   there is a concern that the underlying process is malignant (esophageal
   versus lung).  The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic
   surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this
   time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD,
   biopsy, and possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Follow-up pathology from [**Hospital6 300**]
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy, and has been intubated on continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65, which is likely due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or hypovolemia. The patient has received fluid boluses and dopamine infusion to increase blood pressure.
2. Acute lung injury: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio <300, indicating acute lung injury. The patient is being ventilated on CMV with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic throughout her ICU stay, with a heart rate of 75-40-75 bpm. The patient's bradycardia is likely due to hypotension, sepsis, or sick sinus syndrome. The patient is receiving a dopamine infusion to increase heart rate.
4. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula with a cavitary lung abscess/mass, which is concerning for malignant etiology. The patient has been evaluated by thoracic surgery and has declined surgical intervention at this time.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.2 g/dL, which is low. The patient's anemia is likely due to bleeding, especially given the presence of an intrathoracic process.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute lung injury may progress to ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia may be a sign of sick sinus syndrome or other cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and dark urine may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
5. Malignant progression: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass may be indicative of malignant etiology, which can lead to further complications and death.

The patient's current management plan includes:

1. Continued fluid boluses and dopamine infusion to increase blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Continued mechanical ventilation on CMV with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
3. Antibiotic therapy with cefepime and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage.
4. GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent placement to address the bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
5. Monitoring of the patient's anemia and potential bleeding.
6. Continued cardiac monitoring to assess for arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction.
7. Family meeting to discuss goals of care and expectations with the patient's HCP and family members."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])
   for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and

   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]) and clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**])

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is not responding well to fluid boluses. This may indicate sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, or medication-related hypotension.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which may be due to sinus node dysfunction, sick sinus syndrome, or medication-related bradycardia.
3. Acute Lung Injury (ALI): The patient's P/F ratio is less than 300, indicating ALI. This may be caused by pneumonia, aspiration, or other respiratory insults.
4. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which may lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or lung abscesses.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to bleeding, particularly since she has an intrathoracic process.
6. Hypovolemia: The patient's urine output is poor, and she is not responding well to fluid boluses, which may indicate hypovolemia.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which may indicate respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's cardiovascular system is unstable, with low blood pressure and a low heart rate, which may indicate cardiogenic shock or septic shock.
9. Sepsis: The patient's lactate levels are not elevated, but she has a high white blood cell count and is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate sepsis.
10. Lung Abscess: The patient has a lung abscess, which may lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or empyema.

The patient's current management includes:

1. Fluid boluses to treat hypotension
2. Dopamine infusion to support blood pressure
3. Mechanical ventilation to manage respiratory failure
4. Antibiotics to treat pneumonia and lung abscesses
5. Sedation and analgesia to manage pain and anxiety
6. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and anemia
7. Consideration of pacing for bradycardia
8. Transfer to a higher level of care for further management of bronchoesophageal fistula and lung abscesses."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are noted to be unresponsive, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or abdominal exams.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, ventilator mode, and O2 delivery device. The patient's ABG results show pH: 7.38, PaO2: 222, and PaCO2: 40.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia, aspiration, and tracheobronchial disease due to the necrotizing inflammation
* Impaired skin integrity due to the patient's critical condition
* Bradycardia, which may be related to the patient's medication regimen or underlying condition
* Hemodynamic instability, which may be related to the patient's sepsis or other underlying conditions
* Potential for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP due to the patient's critical condition and prolonged hospitalization

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, with ongoing monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support. The patient's medications will be adjusted as needed to manage their symptoms and prevent potential complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO. TPN started.  Monitor glucose.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU from an OSH for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her current condition is characterized by hypotension, bradycardia, and acute lung injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate levels have not been high recently, but sepsis is still a possibility, particularly given her bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's bradycardia and poor cardiac output suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which could be exacerbated by her lung mass/abscess.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's P/F ratio is <300, which is consistent with ARDS. She is at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count suggest the possibility of bleeding, particularly given her intrathoracic process.
5. Infection: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula make her at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis.
6. Malignancy: The patient's smoking history and the presence of a lung mass/abscess suggest the possibility of underlying malignancy.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and guaiac-positive stools suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given her esophageal process.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and history of atrial fibrillation suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias, which could be exacerbated by her lung mass/abscess.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly her blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the settings as necessary to optimize lung function.
3. Continue to administer antibiotics and antifungals to treat the patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula.
4. Consider decreasing the patient's dopamine drip and administering an albumin bolus to assess her response to fluid therapy.
5. Consider obtaining a tissue biopsy to diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's lung mass/abscess.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and platelet count, and consider transfusing blood products as necessary.
7. Consider decreasing the patient's PEEP to assess her response to changes in respiratory support.
8. Consider obtaining a CT scan or MRI to further evaluate the patient's lung mass/abscess and rule out underlying malignancy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   --Future management will depend of GI input.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - Will need to speak with GI about possibility of scope and stent
   placement. Once get their input, will alter management of other issues.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be attributing to pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: TPN started.  Speak with GI about post-pyloric tube
   placement.
   Glycemic Control:  HISS.

   Code status:  DNR, OK for CVL and pressors (confirmed with HCP).
   Disposition: ICU level of care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is critical, with several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 95/69 mmHg, and she is receiving dopamine to maintain a goal of MAP>65. The etiology of hypotension is unclear, but possible causes include sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, and medication-related vasodilation.
2. Acute Lung Injury (ALI): The patient's P/F ratio is <300, indicating severe respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic throughout her ICU stay, with a heart rate of 65 bpm. The etiology is unclear, but possible causes include sepsis, sinus node dysfunction, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a bronchial fistula communicating with the distal esophagus, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure and hypotension.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but there is a low threshold to suspect bleeding, especially given her intrathoracic process.
6. Cardiovascular (CV) issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her current CV status is unclear. She is receiving telemetry monitoring and has been bradycardic.
7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) 2: The patient is receiving HISS (hypercemented insulin sliding scale) for glycemic control.
8. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's home medication lisinopril has been held.
9. Asthma: The patient is receiving albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn for bronchodilation.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continued fluid boluses PRN and dopamine to maintain a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
2. Continued mechanical ventilation with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
3. Bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy to evaluate the bronchoesophageal fistula and assess for bleeding.
4. Consideration of GI intervention, including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent placement.
5. Monitoring for sepsis and cardiovascular instability.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ALI may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and intrathoracic process may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the bronchoesophageal fistula is not managed effectively.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   --type and screen
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 9.5 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 183 x 10^9/L. The patient's lactate level is 1.1 mmol/L, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a lung abscess in the right lower lobe, and a bronchoesophageal fistula is suspected. The patient's tracheobronchial tree is normal, and there is no evidence of pneumonia or aspiration.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. The patient is taking several medications, including metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol/ipratropium.

The patient's diagnosis is bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and nutritional support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Sepsis: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula can lead to nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

In conclusion, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes who is being treated for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient's diagnosis is based on imaging studies and laboratory results, and the patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and nutritional support. The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac complications, gastrointestinal complications, and nutritional complications."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Goals of care: Although a plan is laid out below, the ICU team will
   have to address goals of care and expectations with her HCP and family
   members.
   --Family meeting today at 5pm.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Decrease DA and give albumin bolus. See if patient can tolerate
   weaning off pressors.
   --Uable to obtain A line.
   .
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if
   patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction.
   --Consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and see if HR increases
   appropriately. If it does not increase, then will call
   electrophysiology consult and see if needs pacing. Patient might need
   transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco and clindamycin (started
   [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
   - Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue
   diagnosis.
   - f/u cultures

   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   --After tidal volumes were initially decreased, patient looked
   uncomfortable on the ventilator. Increased Tv slightly. CXR done and
   showed increased congestion on right. Given 10 mg IV lasix and
   responded. Still low UOP. Dopamine at 1.5 throughout night, breathing
   well on vent
   --cardiology saw the patient and said would defer any pacer treatment
   until patient is more stable.
   --had a family meeting to explain expectations of care. Stressed how
   getting a tissue biopsy might not change outcomes.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is 9.5 K/uL, and her platelet count is 183 K/uL.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 138 and a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.35, pCO2 of 51 mmHg, and pO2 of 82 mmHg.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with bradycardia and a possible etiology of sepsis, poor cardiac output, or hypovolemia.

The patient's medication regimen includes fentanyl, dopamine, lasix, and heparin. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP > 30 and MAP > 65.
2. Decrease dopamine and give albumin bolus to see if patient can tolerate weaning off pressors.
3. Continue CMV ventilation with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
4. Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
5. Decrease tidal volumes to 6cc/kg of ideal body weight and see if patient tolerates it. Increase RR to maintain TV.
6. Continue midazolam and fentanyl drips.
7. Check ABG and consider sedation holiday.
8. Continue nebs PRN.
9. Monitor for bradycardia and consider decreasing dopamine drip slightly and seeing if HR increases appropriately.
10. Consider electrophysiology consult and possible pacing if HR does not increase.
11. Continue cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
12. Contact interventional pulmonology to see if they can obtain a tissue diagnosis.
13. Follow Hct and consider guaiac stools and type and screen for bleeding.
14. Monitor on telemetry for cardiac arrhythmia.
15. Continue HISS for DM 2.
16. Hold home lisinopril for now.
17. Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn for asthma.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of pneumonia, aspiration, and bronchoesophageal fistula, sepsis is a possible complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 138 and a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute. Respiratory failure is a possible complication.
3. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's bradycardia and possible etiology of sepsis, poor cardiac output, or hypovolemia make cardiac arrhythmia a possible complication.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and possible bleeding make bleeding a possible complication.
5. Malignancy: Given the patient's smoking history and the presence of a bronchoesophageal fistula, malignancy is a possible complication.

The patient's plan of care should be individualized to address her specific needs and potential complications. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiac status is essential to prevent and treat potential complications."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   --Future management will depend of GI input.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - Will need to speak with GI about possibility of scope and stent
   placement. Once get their input, will alter management of other issues.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be attributing to pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   --Future management will depend of GI input.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - Will need to speak with GI about possibility of scope and stent
   placement. Once get their input, will alter management of other issues.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardia: Patient has been bradycardic in the setting of
   hypotension throughout her ICU stay. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci
   with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus
   node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be attributing to pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   .
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # CV: Patient initially presented to OSH ED after PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] with concern
   for afib. Since admission to OSH, no evidence of arrhythmia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

   Total time spent:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues have been identified:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, or intubation-related factors. The patient's lactate levels have not been high recently, but sepsis is still a possible diagnosis.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic throughout her ICU stay, which may be attributed to sepsis, sinus node dysfunction, or cardiac component. Cardiology has suggested that bradycardia may be due to sepsis, and transcutaneous pacing may be considered.
3. Acute Lung Injury (ALI): The patient has a P/F ratio <300, indicating likely ALI. She is currently intubated and receiving CMV ventilation. PEEP may need to be decreased to improve CO, and the ARDS protocol should be followed for tidal volume.
4. Bronchoesophageal Fistula: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which is concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating with the distal esophagus. There is a concern that the underlying process may be malignant (esophageal or lung).
5. Tracheobronchial Disease: The patient has tracheobronchial disease, including a trachea/bronchus injury.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be related to her underlying conditions or medical treatments.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to bleeding, especially given her intrathoracic process.
9. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, which may contribute to her cardiac issues. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation.
10. Respiratory Issues: The patient has respiratory failure, which may be due to her underlying conditions or medical treatments.

Based on these findings, the patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP > 30 and MAP > 65.
2. Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
3. Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent placement.
4. Continue cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage given the primary lung abscess.
5. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
6. Continue CMV ventilation and follow the ARDS protocol for tidal volume.
7. Monitor the patient's bradycardia and consider transcutaneous pacing if necessary.
8. Follow the patient's Hct and consider guaiac stools if bleeding is suspected.
9. Continue HISS for glycemic control.
10. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust PEEP as necessary.

Overall, the patient's medical complications and potential issues require careful monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, is admitted to the ICU with a bronchoesophageal fistula, cavitary lung abscess/mass, and pneumonia. She has a history of afib and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute lung injury. The patient is experiencing hypotension, bradycardia, and anemia, and has undergone endoscopy and biopsy to evaluate the esophagus and lung. She is being treated with antibiotics, dopamine, and fentanyl, and is being considered for GI intervention, including EGD and stent placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, bradycardia, and anemia may be related to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may also be related to cardiogenic shock, which can be caused by cardiac failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute lung injury and pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and low threshold for bleeding may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobilization and risk factors for DVT may increase her risk for developing DVT, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and immobilization may increase her risk for developing stress ulcer, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prolonged ventilation and risk factors for VAP may increase her risk for developing VAP, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes in her condition.
2. Adjust the patient's treatment plan as necessary to address any new medical complications that arise.
3. Consider consulting with specialists, such as cardiologists and gastroenterologists, to help manage the patient's condition.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and pain management, as needed.
5. Consider referring the patient to a specialized ICU or a tertiary care center if her condition worsens or if she requires more advanced care."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She has been intubated since admission and is currently on full ventilatory support. Her condition has been complicated by hypotension, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. She has also developed a rash and has been treated with antibiotics for a polymicrobial pneumonia/abscess.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, bradycardia, and atrial fibrillation may be indicative of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and atrial fibrillation may be related to cardiac dysfunction, which could worsen her condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not receive adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Infection: The patient's polymicrobial pneumonia/abscess may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and esophageal stricture may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and her requirement for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her condition.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management. The assessment and plan outlined in the progress note are as follows:

1. Continue full ventilatory support to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat the polymicrobial pneumonia/abscess.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her pressor support as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust her nutrition plan as needed.
5. Consider the patient's family and advance care planning, as her prognosis is poor.
6. Continue to follow up with the patient's primary care physician and other healthcare providers to ensure that her care is coordinated and comprehensive."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications that may arise.

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, or intubation-related factors. Continuous fluid boluses and dopamine infusion are being used to maintain a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
2. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula is a significant concern, and the plan is to transfer her to a hospital with a GI intervention team for further evaluation and possible stent placement.
3. Acute lung injury (ALI): The patient's P/F ratio is <300, indicating likely ARDS. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation on CMV with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be due to sepsis, and cardiology has been consulted. The plan is to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider transcutaneous pacing if necessary.
5. Rash: The patient's rash is unclear, and the differential diagnosis includes contact dermatitis, candidal infection, and drug rash. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and plan treatment.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being monitored, and a low threshold is being maintained to consider bleeding, especially given her intrathoracic process.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, and the plan is to continue monitoring her respiratory status and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration is a concern, and the plan is to continue monitoring her respiratory status and adjusting treatment as needed.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity is a concern, and the plan is to continue monitoring her skin status and adjusting treatment as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78 kg, 59-inch individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient underwent an endoscopy procedure on 8/13 at 5:31 PM, which revealed a friable tissue, mid-esophageal stricture, and a foreign body in the esophagus. The foreign body was removed, and biopsies were taken. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 14, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/64 mmHg. The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a high risk of respiratory failure due to the presence of a foreign body in the esophagus and the development of pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of cardiovascular instability due to the patient's underlying medical conditions.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's endoscopy procedure revealed a friable tissue and a mid-esophageal stricture, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
4. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are negative to date, but there is a risk of infection due to the presence of a foreign body in the esophagus and the development of pneumonia.
5. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin is at risk of integrity issues due to the presence of erythematous macules on the anterior surface of the arms and the contact areas on the skin.
6. Nutritional compromise: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids, which may lead to nutritional compromise if not managed properly.
7. Glycemic control issues: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, which may lead to glycemic control issues if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78 kg, 59-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of tracheobronchial disease, including injury, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia and aspiration. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and the patient has a problem with impaired skin integrity.

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition with lipids and is being monitored for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia and aspiration: The patient's history of tracheobronchial disease and pneumonia increases the risk of pneumonia and aspiration.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infection and further skin damage.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis is increased due to immobility and the presence of multiple lines.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's risk of stress ulcer is increased due to the use of sedatives and vasopressors.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia is increased due to the use of mechanical ventilation.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or medication side effects.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's risk of hypoglycemia is increased due to the use of insulin and the patient's impaired glucose tolerance.
8. Infection: The patient's risk of infection is increased due to the patient's impaired immune system and the presence of multiple lines."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   --Continue dopamine to maintain goals.
   .
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history, there is a concern that
   the underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The
   patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her
   family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer
   to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and
   possible stent placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - f/u cultures from OSH and blood cx here
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV.
   - Consider decreasing PEEP to see if better CO.
   - Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable. Low threshold to think bleeding,
   especially since has intrathoracic process.
   --follow Hct
   --guiaic stools
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.

   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: Patient has been
   bradycardic in the setting of hypotension throughout her ICU stay. On
   [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported previously at OSH. Had one
   EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P waves. Unsure if sick sinus
   syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction. Bradycardia might be
   attributing to pressor needs. Current HR might be be lower than
   appropriate physiological response.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight. She is also receiving dopamine for cardiac support and fentanyl for pain management.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (bradycardic)
* Blood pressure: 108/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a history of sepsis, and her lactate levels have not been high recently, but sepsis is still a possible diagnosis. She has also been diagnosed with acute lung injury (ALI) and is at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 167 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 14 mg/dL
* Glucose: 120 mg/dL

The patient's skin is erythematous and blanching, with macules on the anterior surface of the arms and back.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Bronchoesophageal fistula
* Cavitary lung abscess/mass
* Acute lung injury (ALI)
* Bradycardia with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR)
* Rash (contact dermatitis, candidal infection, or drug rash)
* Anemia
* Asthma
* Diabetes mellitus type 2
* Hypertension

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis
* Cardiogenic shock
* Hypovolemia
* Respiratory failure
* ARDS
* Pneumonia
* Aspiration
* Impaired skin integrity
* Tracheobronchial disease
* Bradycardia
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Anemia
* Asthma exacerbation
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hypertensive crisis

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing fluid boluses and dopamine for cardiac support
* Continuing cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin for anaerobic coverage
* Transferring to a different hospital unit for GI intervention
* Considering IR involvement in obtaining tissue
* Following up on GI biopsy and cultures
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment accordingly
* Continuing mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting treatment accordingly
* Considering switching to a tracheostomy if long-term ventilation is needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78 kg, 59-inch tall individual with a BMI of approximately 34.9. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube, with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient has a history of tracheobronchial disease, including pneumonia and aspiration, which is currently being managed with antibiotics. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, with erythematous macules on the anterior surface of the arms and back.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 167 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 30 and an AST of 48. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen of 14 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulation therapy. The patient is also receiving TPN and has a multi-lumen central venous catheter in place.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia and aspiration: The patient's tracheobronchial disease and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of pneumonia and aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure may lead to respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's vasopressors and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure.
7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate hepatic dysfunction.

In conclusion, the patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's potential medical complications include pneumonia and aspiration, sepsis, skin breakdown, respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, admitted to the ICU for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. The patient has a complex medical condition, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia, aspiration, and acute lung injury are already present, and the patient is intubated on CMV ventilation. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is high due to the prolonged intubation.
	* The patient's lung mass and abscess may compress the surrounding tissues, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Bradycardia, which is likely due to sepsis, may progress to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
	* Hypotension, possibly due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or hypovolemia, may lead to organ dysfunction.
	* The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and the risk of cardiogenic shock is high.
3. Infectious Complications:
	* The patient has a history of lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula, which increases the risk of sepsis and bacteremia.
	* The presence of bilateral pleural effusion and increased pulmonary congestion may indicate a secondary infection.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula, which may lead to aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* The risk of gastrointestinal complications is high due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of antibiotics.
5. Skin Complications:
	* The patient has a rash, which may be due to contact dermatitis, candidal infection, or drug eruption. The rash may progress to skin breakdown and infection.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* The patient has anemia, which may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, infection, or bone marrow suppression.
7. Nutritional Complications:
	* The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which may lead to malnutrition and related complications.
8. Neurological Complications:
	* The patient is sedated, and the risk of delirium and cognitive impairment is high.
	* The patient's neurological status may deteriorate due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, admitted to the ICU with a bronchoesophageal fistula, cavitary lung abscess, and mass. The patient has undergone various interventions, including bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy, and has been receiving antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 8.0
* Hct: 34.5%
* Platelet count: 175 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-174 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of bradycardia, which has been attributed to sepsis and poor cardiac output. The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the past.

The patient has a rash, which is being evaluated by dermatology. The patient's anemia is stable, and the patient is receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

The patient has a history of asthma, diabetes, and hypertension, and is receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia, aspiration, and impaired skin integrity due to the bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess
* Sepsis, poor cardiac output, and hypovolemia due to the patient's underlying condition and treatment
* Bradycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response due to sepsis and poor cardiac output
* Anemia and hypoproteinemia due to the patient's underlying condition and treatment
* Nutritional deficiencies due to the patient's inability to eat and the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Skin infections or ulcers due to the patient's impaired skin integrity
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the use of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and antifungal agents for the treatment of the patient's underlying infection
* Monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications
* Adjusting the patient's treatment plan as needed to manage any complications that arise
* Providing supportive care, such as nutrition and hydration, to help the patient recover from their underlying condition."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still
   positive fluid status.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR shows improving fluid status. The current
   goal would be to try and wean the patient off ventilation so that she
   can provide input into her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt

   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to have
   good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still
   positive fluid status.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR shows improving fluid status. The current
   goal would be to try and wean the patient off ventilation so that she
   can provide input into her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to have
   good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.

   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct

   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is:

1. Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated due to ARDS, with a P/F ratio <200. The CXR shows improving fluid status.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has bradycardia, which is likely due to sepsis, and may also be attributed to cardiac component. She has been treated with dopamine to maintain MAP, but currently able to maintain on her own.
3. Renal: The patient has dark urine, indicating possible hypovolemia, and has been receiving fluid boluses PRN.
4. Skin: The patient has a rash on her back and arms, which is likely due to contact dermatitis or candidal infection, but not drug-related.
5. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula and a cavitary lung abscess/mass, which is being treated with antibiotics.
6. Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's hypovolemia and dark urine may indicate impending renal failure.
5. Skin infection: The patient's rash may become infected, leading to sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and drink may lead to nutritional deficiencies.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Ventilation: The patient is being ventilated to improve her respiratory status.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to treat her bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
3. Fluid management: The patient is receiving fluid boluses PRN to maintain her fluid status.
4. Sedation: The patient is receiving sedation to manage her anxiety and agitation.
5. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management to control her pain.
6. Nutrition: The patient is receiving TPN with lipids to provide her with nutritional support.
7. Cardiovascular support: The patient is receiving dopamine to maintain her MAP.

The patient's future goals of care will depend on the results of her CT scan and her overall condition. A family meeting has been planned for tomorrow to discuss her future goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 59-inch tall, 95.6 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

Lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.0-9.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 152-178 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 0.3-0.6 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.9 g/dL
* LDH: 228 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's current problems include bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and has a code status of ""full code.""

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and tracheobronchial disease may lead to respiratory failure, requiring further mechanical ventilation and possibly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and impaired skin integrity may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's bradycardia and hypertension may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or other cardiovascular complications.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's impaired skin integrity and pneumonia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels may indicate underlying renal dysfunction, which can worsen if the patient's fluid status is not closely monitored and managed.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels may indicate hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of complications such as infections and organ damage.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, particularly if the patient is immobile or has poor circulation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix gtt on [**8-16**] since still
   positive fluid status.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio <200, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR shows improving fluid status. The current
   goal would be to try and wean the patient off ventilation so that she
   can provide input into her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to have
   good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration and is at risk of developing pneumonia, which could be complicated by the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk of developing sepsis again due to the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula and the patient's underlying lung disease.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia and is at risk of developing bradycardia again due to the patient's underlying heart disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
5. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension and is at risk of developing hypotension again due to the patient's underlying heart disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and is at risk of developing anemia again due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
7. Rash: The patient has a history of rash and is at risk of developing rash again due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is at risk of developing infection again due to the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula and the patient's underlying lung disease.
9. Lung abscess: The patient has a history of lung abscess and is at risk of developing lung abscess again due to the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula and the patient's underlying lung disease.
10. Esophageal stricture: The patient has a history of esophageal stricture and is at risk of developing esophageal stricture again due to the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula and the patient's underlying lung disease.

The patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of a tracheobronchial fistula make them a high-risk patient for developing these complications. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust their treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications from arising."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with
   plan for GI intervention including EGD, biopsy, and possible stent
   placement.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora
   - cultures here have been negative for growth
   - Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy. Will try to obtain prelim results of path.
   - Consider diuresing pateint or doing a Swan to assess CO, TSVR. Will
   clarify goals with family.
   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV
   for goal tidal volume of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight.
   - Continue CMV. Follow ARDS protocol for tidal volume of 6cc/kg.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   --check ABG daily.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash. Drug eruption
   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Acute lung injury: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if
   this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  P/F ratio <300, so likely [**Doctor Last Name 11**]. Continue to intubate on CMV

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN and dopamine for a goal of UOP>30 and
   MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might be attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.

   unlikely.
   --Will clarify goals of treatment with HCP and then decide treatment
   today.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which is currently being managed with fluid boluses and dopamine. She also has bradycardia, which has been attributed to sepsis and possible sinus node dysfunction. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a P/F ratio of 192.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, indicating possible sepsis. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. She also has a history of pneumonia and aspiration, which is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's skin integrity is impaired, with a rash present on her body. The cause of the rash is unclear, but it may be related to a candidal infection or a drug rash.

The patient's anemia is being monitored, and her blood glucose levels are being controlled with insulin.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, which are being managed with medication.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis. This could lead to organ failure and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's P/F ratio is below 300, indicating possible acute lung injury. This could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could lead to cardiac arrest and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs and increased risk of organ failure.
5. Skin infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and rash could lead to a skin infection, which could spread to other parts of the body.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, which could exacerbate other medical conditions.
7. Diabetes: The patient's type 2 diabetes could lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy.

Based on the patient's current health status and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status closely. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be continued, and her fluid and electrolyte balance should be closely monitored. The patient's skin integrity should be assessed regularly, and her anemia should be monitored and treated as necessary. The patient's diabetes should be managed with insulin and other medications as needed."

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems now.
   Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   .
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems now.
   Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril/nodal agents for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a complex medical history, including a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support of 18 cmH2O and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96%.
* Cardiovascular: She has bradycardia with episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her blood pressure is 101/50 mmHg, and she is receiving dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure.
* Hemodynamic: She is fluid-positive, and her central venous oxygen saturation is high.
* Neurological: She is sedated and responds to commands, but her neurological examination is limited due to her intubation.
* Skin: She has developed a rash, which is likely a drug rash, and is being treated with antihistamines and steroids.
* Gastrointestinal: She has a stricture in the esophagus and a foreign body lodged in the esophagus, which was confirmed by GI scope. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her inability to tolerate oral feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula may lead to further respiratory deterioration, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Sepsis: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and increase the risk of mortality.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's esophageal stricture and foreign body may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as esophageal perforation or obstruction.
* Skin complications: The patient's drug rash may lead to further skin complications, such as infection or allergic reactions.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral feeding may lead to malnutrition, which can increase the risk of mortality and morbidity.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status. Additionally, the patient's family should be involved in the decision-making process to ensure that her goals of care are respected and her treatment plan is aligned with her wishes."

   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix since still positive fluid
   status.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, and pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a P/F ratio of 250s, suggesting non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and likely ARDS.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a Hct of 34.7%, and elevated lactate levels. Her WBC count is 8.0, and her platelet count is 202. Her blood cultures have been negative for growth, and her sputum has been sent for AFB stain.

The patient's physical examination shows a sedated patient with a tracheostomy in place, rhonchorous breath sounds throughout, and 1+ pretibial edema. She has erythematous, blanching macules on her arms and back, which are thought to be due to contact dermatitis or candidal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and positive fluid balance suggest sepsis, which may be due to her lung abscess or pneumonia.
2. ARDS: The patient's P/F ratio of 250s and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema suggest ARDS, which may be exacerbated by her lung abscess and pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, or intubation-related causes.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be due to sepsis, sinus node dysfunction, or sick sinus syndrome.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow failure.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may be due to aspiration or secondary to her lung abscess.
7. Lung abscess: The patient's lung abscess may be due to infection or inflammation.
8. Bronchoesophageal fistula: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula may be due to trauma, infection, or inflammation.

Plan:

1. Continue cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin for additional anaerobic coverage given primary lung abscess.
2. Send sputum for AFB stain.
3. Obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and cavitary lung lesion.
4. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
5. F/u GI biopsy.
6. Continue midazolam and fentanyl infusions.
7. Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient can tolerate the change.
8. Check ABG after change.
9. Continue nebs PRN.
10. Start thinking about switching to trach if long-term ventilation.
11. Consider diuresing patient with Lasix since still positive fluid status.
12. Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP > 30 and MAP > 65.
13. Monitor patient's cardiac status and consider transcutaneous pacing if necessary.
14. Monitor patient's skin integrity and consider treatment for contact dermatitis or candidal infection.
15. Continue to monitor patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
16. Continue to monitor patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
17. Consider switching to TPN with lipids if patient's nutrition needs are not being met."

   .
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung).  The patient
   has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have
   declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI scoped the patient and
   found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the esophagus. About 25 cm
   down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body lodged in the esophagus.
   Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but prelim reports only showed
   necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on current therapy, but since
   lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a history of TB, need to get
   AFB stain.
   - Continue cefepime (started [**2139-8-9**]), vanco (started [**2139-8-9**])  and
   clindamycin (started [**2139-8-10**]) for additional anaerobic coverage given
   primary lung abscess.
   - OSH records from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been
   negative for growth
   - send sputum for AFB stain
   - Will obtain a chest CT with IV contrast to assess fistula and
   cavitary lung lesion. Consider IR involvement in obtaining tissue.
   - F/u GI biopsy.
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Consider diuresing patient with Lasix since still positive fluid
   status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation.
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   # Fluid status: On CXR, less interstitial infiltrates. Continuing to
   have good UOP, but still positive 10 L overall.
   - Will diurese with Lasix gtt on [**8-17**]. Need to use drip since low MAP.
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   --Can consider transcutaneous pacing.
   #Rash: contact derm vs. candidal infection vs. drug rash on back. Some
   extension of rash on arms. Drug eruption unlikely.
   --No treatment at this time.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula with a cavitary lung abscess/mass, and is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The current goal is to try and wean the patient off ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or hypovolemia. She is receiving dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) and is currently able to maintain on her own.
3. Infectious: The patient has a lung abscess and is receiving antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin) for anaerobic coverage. Cultures have been negative for growth, and an AFB stain is pending.
4. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a stricture in the esophagus, which is preventing the passage of a tube. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will likely require a surgical tube placement (J-tube) in the future.
5. Skin: The patient has a rash on her back and arms, which is likely due to contact dermatitis or candidal infection.
6. Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is currently stable.
7. Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes, which is being managed with HISS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula put her at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's lung abscess and recent antibiotic use increase her risk for sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia put her at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stricture and recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.
5. Skin complications: The patient's rash and recent antibiotic use increase her risk for skin complications, such as allergic reactions and infections.
6. Endocrine complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes and recent antibiotic use increase her risk for endocrine complications, such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue antibiotics for anaerobic coverage and consider adding coverage for possible TB.
3. Consider diuresis with Lasix to manage fluid status and hypotension.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust pressor support as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and consider surgical tube placement in the future.
6. Monitor the patient's skin status and consider treatment for the rash.
7. Continue to manage the patient's type 2 diabetes and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
8. Consider cardiology consultation to evaluate the patient's bradycardia and potential cardiac complications.
9. Consider infectious disease consultation to evaluate the patient's lung abscess and potential for TB.
10. Continue to educate the patient and family on the patient's condition and plan of care."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems now.
   Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril/nodal agents for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, need to get AFB stain.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-10**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime given new likely drug rash and no
   culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # ARDS: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear if this was
   secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and upper
   endoscopy.  Currently, P/F ratio 250s, with non-cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema so likely ARDS. CXR unchanged. The current goal would be to try
   and wean the patient off ventilation so that she can provide input into
   her future care. Pt is fluid positive.
   - Change ventilation to pressure support and see if patient able to
   tolerate the change.
   - Check ABG after change.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems now.
   Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   .
   # Hypotension: Clinically, the patient appears euvolemic. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril/nodal agents for now.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Intubated and ventilated with a pressure support mode, with a P/F ratio of 250s and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, consistent with ARDS.
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardic with episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and right ventricular failure (RVR). The patient's heart rate has improved, but the underlying cause of bradycardia is unclear.
* Hemodynamic: The patient is fluid-positive, with a goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has anuria, with a urine output of 0 mL in the past 24 hours.
* Skin: The patient has developed a rash, which is likely a drug rash caused by clindamycin.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a bronchoesophageal fistula and a cavitary lung abscess/mass, which is concerning for possible underlying malignancy.
* Endocrine: The patient has type 2 diabetes and is being treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension increase the risk of cardiovascular collapse.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of response to antibiotics suggest the possibility of sepsis.
4. Malignancy: The patient's cavitary lung abscess/mass and bronchoesophageal fistula raise concerns about underlying malignancy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/mass increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate enteral nutrition increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Skin complications: The patient's rash and potential for further skin breakdown increase the risk of skin complications.
8. Endocrine complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes and potential for further endocrine complications increase the risk of endocrine-related issues.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status. The patient's family should be educated about her condition and the potential complications that can arise. A family meeting should be held to discuss the patient's goals of care and the potential need for tracheostomy and long-term ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 78 kg, 59-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including cefipime, vancomycin, and clindamycin, and has been given furosemide, midazolam, and fentanyl for pain management. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture have all been negative to date.

The patient's skin is erythematous and has blanching macules on the anterior surface of the arms and back. The patient's abdominal exam is normal, and the patient's neurological exam is intact.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, platelet count of 215 K/uL, and lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture have all been negative to date, but the patient's temperature is elevated, and the patient has been receiving antibiotics. Sepsis is a potential complication, especially given the patient's impaired skin integrity.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and the patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on a non-rebreather mask. Pneumonia is a potential complication, especially given the patient's tracheobronchial disease.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a potential complication, especially given the patient's bradycardia and tracheobronchial disease.
4. Skin integrity: The patient's skin is erythematous and has blanching macules on the anterior surface of the arms and back, which is a potential complication, especially given the patient's impaired skin integrity.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has received 2,289 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, which is a potential complication, especially given the patient's impaired cardiac function.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, skin integrity issues, and fluid overload."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU level of care<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78 kg male with a height of 59 inches, currently weighing 99 kg. He has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and aspiration.

The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including antibiotic administration (Cefipime, Vancomycin, and Clindamycin), vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. He has also received fluids and blood products.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/52 mmHg. His respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate that his white blood cell count is 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count is 215 K/uL. His blood chemistry results show mild elevation in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and mild hypocalcemia.

The patient's radiology results show a poorly differentiated carcinoma, and a biopsy has been recommended but is pending.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and aspiration, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and bradycardia, which increases his risk of cardiac complications.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient has undergone multiple invasive procedures, including central lines and urinary catheterization, which increases his risk of developing infections.
6. Renal failure: The patient has received large amounts of fluids and blood products, which increases his risk of developing acute kidney injury or renal failure.

Based on this information, I recommend close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology results to identify any potential complications early. The patient should also be continued on antibiotics and vasopressors as necessary. A multidisciplinary approach, including input from intensivists, pulmonologists, and surgeons, should be considered to optimize the patient's care."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB

   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU with bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her current condition is stable, but she has developed a contraction alkalosis likely due to Lasix gtt. She has also developed a rash, likely due to a drug reaction, and has been experiencing hypotension, bradycardia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of smoking and has developed a cavitary lung abscess, which may be a sign of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be due to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions to maintain her oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may be due to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or sick sinus syndrome.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Skin complications: The patient's rash may progress to more severe skin complications, such as desquamation or skin necrosis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and her requirement for TPN may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.
8. Infection: The patient's presence of a bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue Lasix gtt to manage the patient's fluid status and blood pressure.
2. Aggressively replete potassium to manage the patient's contraction alkalosis.
3. Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarbonate levels.
4. Continue clindamycin for coverage of the patient's lung abscess.
5. D/c vancomycin and cefepime due to the patient's likely drug rash.
6. Continue fentanyl and midazolam infusions to manage the patient's pain and sedation.
7. Consider switching to tracheostomy if the patient requires long-term ventilation.
8. Order transaminases to monitor the patient's liver function.
9. Follow the patient's eosinophil trend to monitor for potential allergic reactions.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status closely to identify any potential complications."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril/nodal agents for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a rash on her arms and legs, which is likely a drug rash. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and tracheobronchial disease. She has also had a bronchoscopy and upper endoscopy, which showed a stricture and foreign body in the esophagus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 37.4°C, HR = 78 bpm, BP = 101/47 mmHg, RR = 18 breaths/min, SpO2 = 99%
* Laboratory results: WBC = 8.8 x 10^9/L, Hct = 35.2%, Plt = 227 x 10^9/L, Cr = 0.3 mg/dL, TCO2 = 34 mmHg, Glucose = 120 mg/dL
* Cultures: Negative for growth to date
* Radiology: CT esophogram and barium swallow showing a RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating with the distal esophagus

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of a lung abscess.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure due to the underlying lung disease.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and bradycardia, and there is a risk of developing cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock.
* Renal failure: The patient has a high risk of developing renal failure due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of a lung abscess.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a stricture and foreign body in the esophagus, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
* Skin complications: The patient has a rash on her arms and legs, which may worsen and lead to skin complications such as cellulitis or necrotizing fasciitis.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient will continue to receive antibiotic therapy for the lung abscess and bronchoesophageal fistula.
* The patient will be monitored for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, renal failure, gastrointestinal complications, and skin complications.
* The patient will receive close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology studies.
* The patient will be followed up with cardiology and gastroenterology consultations to further evaluate and manage her underlying medical conditions.
* The patient will be considered for surgery to repair the bronchoesophageal fistula and remove the foreign body from the esophagus."

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.

   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 8360**] is a 54 female with a smoking history,
   hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes transferred from an OSH
   for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess/[**Hospital 9093**] distress: Patient was intubated at OSH, although unclear
   if this was secondary to respiratory failure or for bronchoscopy and
   upper endoscopy.  Originally thought the patient had [**Doctor Last Name 11**]
ARDS because
   P/F ration, b/l infiltrates , and non-cardiogenic PE (nl Echo). Now,
   infiltrates more likely consistent with increased fluid. Pt is fluid
   positive. The current goal would be to try and wean the patient off
   ventilation so that she can provide input into her future care.
   - Patient was initially on volume cycled AC
pressure support [**10-26**] now.
   - Continue midaz gtt and fentaynl gtt
   - Lasix gtt (goal MAP>60) since still positive fluid status.
   --sedation holiday
   --continue nebs PRN
   --start thinking about switching to trach if long term ventilation
   (will depend on goals of care per family mtg)
   .
   # Contraction alkalosis: Patient developed a contraction alkalosis
   likely secondary to Lasix gtt. Lasix gtt needed, so will continue.
   - Volume status goal: -1L/day
   - Aggressively replete potassium.
   - Consider diamox treatment to lower bicarb.
   # Rash: Rash has progressed from back and RUE to b/l U/L extrems and
   has low grade fevers. Macular/blanching, no desquamation. Likely drug
   rash.
   -- will d/c vanc/cefepime given they are not likely needed given no
   growth on cultures to date, can consult derm if worsens
   -- will check for oral lesions.
   --order transaminases
   --follow eosinophil trend
   # Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow
   concerning for RLL/RML lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating
   with distal esophagus. OSH records say no areas of malignancy, but
   given patient's significant smoking history and
   location/characteristics of mass, there is a concern that the
   underlying process is malignant (esophageal versus lung). OSH records
   from bronch showed normal flora. Cultures here have been negative for
   growth. The patient has already been evaluated by Thoracic surgery, and
   her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.  GI
   scoped the patient and found normal mucosa in the first [**2-24**] of the
   esophagus. About 25 cm down, GI noted a stricture and foreign body
   lodged in the esophagus. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken, but
   prelim reports only showed necrotic tissue. Patient has improvement on
   current therapy, but since lung lesion is cavitary and patient has a
   history of TB, cannot r/o TB.
   - Continue clindamycin q8h (started [**2139-8-17**]) for coverage given primary
   lung abscess
 d/c vanco/cefepime on [**8-17**] given new likely drug rash
   and no culture growth to date
   - f/u cultures, AFB
   - IR c/s for possibility of CT guided bx
   - Since there is a stricture, unable to pass a tube, so will have to
   give patient TPN. Long term nutrition will likely need a surgical tube
   placed (J tube?). Need to speak with GI if desire to get tube.
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline, the patient is hypertensive. Possible
   etiologies of hypotension include sepsis, poor cardiac output,
   hypovolemia, medication related and intubation related. Likely
   diagnoses include sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock. Sepsis possible,
   although lactates have not been high recently. Given patient
   bradycardia, poor cardiac output is also a possibility and there might
   be some compressive effect of the lung mass/abscess (central venous
   oxygen high). Hypovolemia is less likely since she does not respond
   well to boluses, however, her urine is dark (Adequate CVPs, but
   complicated by tricuspid regurg and PEEP). The fentanyl drip can also
   be contributing to her vasodilation, but the benefits of the drip
   outweigh the risks. Patient needed dopamine to maintain MAP, but
   currently able to maintain on own.
   --Continue fluid boluses PRN for a goal of UOP>30 and MAP>65.
   .
   #Bradycardic with episodes of A. fib with RVR: HR has improved. In the
   past, the patient has been bradycardic in the setting of hypotension
   throughout her ICU stay. On [**8-13**], patient had A. fib with RVR, reported
   previously at OSH. Had one EKG showing ectopic foci with inverted P
   waves. Unsure if sick sinus syndrome?, definite sinus node dysfunction.
   Bradycardia might have been attributing to previous pressor needs.
   --cardiology thinks bradycardia likely due to sepsis. Might be some
   cardiac component, but will defer treatment until patient recovers.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct currently stable.
   --follow Hct
   .
   # Asthma: Continue albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
   # DM 2: Continue HISS.
   .
   # HTN: Hold home lisinopril/nodal agents for now.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a smoking history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and tracheobronchial disease. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's 24-hour events include a fever spike to 101.2°F, increased white secretions, and a failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with desaturations in the high 80s. She was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's physical examination reveals a sedated patient with rhonchorous lung sounds throughout, wheezes heard throughout, and erythematous macules on the anterior surface of the arms and back.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased albumin and calcium levels. Cultures have been negative for growth to date.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Bronchoesophageal fistula: CT esophogram and barium swallow showed a right lower lobe (RLL) lung abscess with a RLL bronchus communicating with the distal esophagus. OSH records showed normal flora. Cultures have been negative for growth. The patient has been evaluated by thoracic surgery, and her family/HCP have declined surgical intervention at this time.
2. Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, likely secondary to vancomycin and cefepime. The rash has progressed to involve the bilateral upper and lower extremities and has low-grade fevers. The patient will be discharged from vancomycin and cefepime, and oral lesions will be checked.
3. Hypotension: The patient has developed hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, hypovolemia, medication-related, and intubation-related factors. The patient will continue to receive fluid boluses PRN for a goal of urine output (UOP) >30 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has been bradycardic, which is likely due to sepsis. Cardiology thinks that bradycardia might be due to sepsis, and the patient will be monitored closely.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, and she will be followed closely.
6. Asthma: The patient will continue to receive albuterol/ipratropium MDI prn.
7. DM 2: The patient will continue to receive HISS.
8. HTN: The patient's home lisinopril/nodal agents will be held for now.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying lung abscess and pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which may worsen her respiratory status.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and pneumonia.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may worsen her cardiovascular status.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and cavitary lung abscess may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration and necrosis.
6. Skin complications: The patient's rash may worsen and lead to skin complications, such as desquamation and infection.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's malnutrition may worsen her overall health and increase her risk for complications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying lung disease and pneumonia."

Summary:

The patient is a 78 kg, 59-inch tall female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, and impaired skin integrity. She was found to have pneumonia and aspiration, and was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin, and has had a fever spike to 101.2°F. Her respiratory status has been improving, with a RSBI of 119 and an SpO2 of 99%. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure if her lungs continue to be inflamed and she develops respiratory acidosis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.
4. Aspiration: The patient has aspiration, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could lead to skin breakdown and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer, which could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.
8. VAP: The patient has VAP, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated effectively.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current status is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications. The patient should continue to receive antibiotics, and her respiratory status should be closely monitored. She should also continue to receive prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer. The patient's skin integrity should be closely monitored, and she should be turned regularly to prevent skin breakdown. The patient's blood cultures should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if sepsis is suspected."

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition has remained relatively stable, with some fluctuations. The patient's fever spiked to 101.2°F, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent to investigate the cause. The patient was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 101/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 370 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 227 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 227 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a sodium level of 136 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antibiotics for VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) progression or development of secondary infections.
2. Hemodynamic instability due to changes in blood pressure or heart rate.
3. Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory distress.
4. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count.
5. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications due to platelet count fluctuations.
6. Electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances due to changes in laboratory results.
7. Worsening of skin integrity or development of pressure ulcers.
8. Cardiovascular complications, such as atrial fibrillation or bradycardia, due to changes in heart rate or rhythm.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support, while also adjusting treatment plans as needed to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: Will become CMO today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. She has been admitted to the ICU with a fever of 101.6°F, tachypnea, and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation with CPAP/PSV mode, and she is receiving oxygen therapy at 50% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchorous lung sounds throughout, with wheezes heard throughout. She has erythematous macules on her arms and back, which are blanching and confluent. Her neurological examination shows that she is sedated, opens her eyes to name, follows commands, and can squeeze her hand and wiggle her toes.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC count of 8.1-9.1 K/uL. Her hemoglobin and platelet counts are within normal limits. Her liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, are elevated, and her alkaline phosphatase is also elevated. Her electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. She has a bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient's history of tracheobronchial disease and her current respiratory symptoms suggest the possibility of further respiratory compromise and failure.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's erythematous macules on her arms and back suggest the possibility of further skin breakdown and infection.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation suggests the possibility of further cardiac complications, including stroke and heart failure.

In terms of potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's medications, the patient is receiving fentanyl, midazolam, and morphine, which can lead to respiratory depression and sedation. The patient is also receiving acetaminophen and senna/biscodyl, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, aspiration, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode with a FiO2 of 50%.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.1-9.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.3-12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 175-227 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34-41 mmHg
* Glucose: 106-136 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and lipase levels.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and pain management medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's pneumonia and tracheobronchial disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and bradycardia
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to the patient's impaired skin integrity
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's impaired gut function and antibiotic use
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's pneumonia, sepsis, or antibiotic use
* Increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. She has been admitted to the ICU with a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C) and is currently sedated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchorous breath sounds throughout the lung fields, wheezes, and no bowel sounds. She has 1+ pretibial edema and 2+ pedal edema. Her skin examination shows erythematous, blanching macules on the anterior surface of her arms and back, with confluent patches on her anterior thighs and tibia.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 227 K/μL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 17 U/L and AST of 30 U/L. Her renal function is normal, with a creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 12 mg/dL.

The patient's diagnosis includes atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. Her plan includes extubation once her family arrives, and her medications include fentanyl, midazolam, morphine, and acetaminophen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and tracheobronchial disease can lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to skin breakdown, which can increase her risk of infection and other complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and bradycardia can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tracheobronchial disease and pneumonia can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple comorbidities, and her condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: Will become CMO today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a bronchoesophageal fistula and a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, most likely of pulmonary origin. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed several complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating an inflammatory response and possible organ dysfunction. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low albumin level.

The patient's physical examination reveals a sedated and intubated patient with a tracheostomy in place. Her lungs are rhonchorous throughout, with wheezes heard throughout. She has 1+ pretibial edema and 2+ pedal edema.

The patient's skin examination shows erythematous, blanching macules on the anterior surface of her arms and back, which have extended to her anterior thighs and tibia. The rash appears to be a sign of allergic reaction to one of the medications.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Atrial fibrillation
* Bradycardia
* Tracheobronchial disease
* Pneumonia
* Impaired skin integrity
* Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's bronchoesophageal fistula and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tracheobronchial disease and pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and bradycardia
* Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to the patient's impaired skin integrity
* Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of nutrition

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing her respiratory and cardiovascular status, preventing skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, and addressing any electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, the patient's family should be educated on her condition and the importance of following the plan of care to ensure her optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a bronchoesophageal fistula, likely due to a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tracheobronchial disease, and pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 73-105 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 99/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Height: 59 inches
* Weight: 96.9 kg (admitted weight: 78 kg)

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a rash on her forearm and back, which is erythematous and blanching.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.1-9.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.3-12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 175-227 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34-41 mmHg
* Glucose: 106-136 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Fentanyl drip
* Midazolam drip
* Morphine PRN
* Acetaminophen PRN

The patient's plan includes:

* Extubation once family arrives
* No surgical intervention
* Comfort care with fentanyl, midazolam, and morphine
* Glycemic control with acetaminophen
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to tracheobronchial disease and pneumonia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to bronchoesophageal fistula and pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and bradycardia
* Skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to immobility and malnutrition
* Gastrointestinal complications due to tracheoesophageal fistula and malnutrition
* Infection due to bronchoesophageal fistula and pneumonia
* Respiratory failure due to tracheal injury and pneumonia

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."
