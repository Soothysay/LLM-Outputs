   CT of HEAD:  IMPRESSION: Scattered areas with low attenuation in the
   subcortical white matter as described above, more conspicuous on the
   right frontal lobe, consistent with the previously demonstrated
   thromboembolic ischemic changes, and there is no evidence of
   hemorrhagic transformation, mass,mass effect, or shifting of the
   normally midline structures. Persistent prominent sulci at the left
   frontal region, followup in this area is recommended. If there is any
   clinical concern related with new ischemic area, correlation with MRI
   is recommended if clinically warranted.
   - repeat Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20-25%).  There is a very small pericardial effusion,
   no signs of tamponade.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2184-3-15**], ejection fraction is now severely depressed. The right
   ventricle, although not well seen, is dilated and hypokinetic. There is
   a small amount of pericardial fluid seen adjacent to the right atrium,
   without evidence of tamponade physiology.
   - MRI of C-spine and head: 1. Limited study due to motion. 2. No
   definite brainstem or cord signal abnormality. 3. Mild to moderate
   spinal canal stenosis at C3-4, with probable at least moderate neural
   foraminal narrowing at this level as well, though evaluation of the
   neural foramina is markedly limited due to motion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval
   development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive,
   asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).
   -vancomycin, zosyn
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending clinical improvement.
   -c-spine MRI pending clinical improvement
   -need to get LP when warmed
   -trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5.1
 likely [**1-20**] to peripheral
   vasoconstriction).
   .
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well on current settings,
   hyperventilating as well.
   - on vent continue current settings
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow.
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors
   - consider addition of ionotropic support (dopa?)
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- LP
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted to the ICU with fevers and hypotension. He developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, became unresponsive, and was in asystolic cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, he was found to have a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) rhythm. He is currently being supported on vasopressors and fluids.

The patient's condition is characterized by:

* Fever (101.1°F)
* Hypothermia (cooled to 32°C)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Respiratory acidosis (pH 7.29)
* Metabolic acidosis (lactate 5.1 mmol/L)
* Cardiac dysfunction (severely depressed left ventricular systolic function)
* Embolic stroke (newly diagnosed)
* Hyperlipidemia (stable)
* Chronic kidney disease, stage III (stable)
* Hypothyroidism (not requiring thyroid replacement at this time)
* Adrenal nodules (not requiring steroids at this time)

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of a positive blood culture
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to cardiac dysfunction
* Respiratory failure or respiratory arrest due to respiratory acidosis
* Neurological deficits or worsening of existing stroke symptoms
* Infections or sepsis due to the presence of a central line or other invasive devices
* Bleeding or hemorrhagic complications due to the presence of a positive blood culture or other underlying conditions
* Metabolic acidosis or lactic acidosis due to inadequate tissue perfusion or other underlying conditions
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to inadequate insulin therapy or other underlying conditions
* Electrolyte imbalances or disturbances due to inadequate electrolyte management or other underlying conditions

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to provide supportive care, including vasopressors and fluids, to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and provide treatment as necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide treatment as necessary to prevent respiratory failure or respiratory arrest.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide treatment as necessary to prevent worsening of existing stroke symptoms or development of new neurological deficits.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide treatment as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances or disturbances.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and provide treatment as necessary to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's lactate levels and provide treatment as necessary to prevent metabolic acidosis or lactic acidosis.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and provide treatment as necessary to prevent sepsis or septic shock.
* Consider adding ionotropic support (e.g., dobutamine) to improve cardiac function.
* Consider adding steroids to improve immune function and prevent further complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide treatment as necessary to prevent worsening of chronic kidney disease.
* Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and provide treatment as necessary to prevent hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
* Continue to monitor the patient's adrenal function and provide treatment as necessary to prevent adrenal insufficiency or hyperadrenalism.
* Consider performing a CT scan or MRI of the brain to further evaluate the patient's stroke symptoms.
* Consider performing a cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and potential for revascularization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   right frontal lobe, consistent with the previously demonstrated
   thromboembolic ischemic changes, and there is no evidence of
   hemorrhagic transformation, mass,mass effect, or shifting of the
   normally midline structures. Persistent prominent sulci at the left
   frontal region, followup in this area is recommended. If there is any
   clinical concern related with new ischemic area, correlation with MRI
   is recommended if clinically warranted.
   - repeat Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20-25%).  There is a very small pericardial effusion,
   no signs of tamponade.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2184-3-15**], ejection fraction is now severely depressed. The right
   ventricle, although not well seen, is dilated and hypokinetic. There is
   a small amount of pericardial fluid seen adjacent to the right atrium,
   without evidence of tamponade physiology.
   - MRI of C-spine and head: 1. Limited study due to motion. 2. No
   definite brainstem or cord signal abnormality. 3. Mild to moderate
   spinal canal stenosis at C3-4, with probable at least moderate neural
   foraminal narrowing at this level as well, though evaluation of the
   neural foramina is markedly limited due to motion.

   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).

   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with fevers and hypotension, later diagnosed with embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation. The patient is currently being supported on levophed and fluids and is undergoing extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.1°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 58 bpm
* Blood pressure: 104/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure: 3 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 188 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 5.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* LDH: 684 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT of the head: Scattered areas with low attenuation in the subcortical white matter, consistent with thromboembolic ischemic changes.
* MRI of the C-spine and head: Limited study due to motion, but no definite brainstem or cord signal abnormality.

The patient's medical history includes:

* Coronary artery disease (CAD)
* Hyperlipidemia
* Chronic kidney disease, stage III
* Hypothyroidism
* Adrenal nodules

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Zosyn
* Levophed
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Phenylephrine
* Vasopressin
* Norepinephrine
* Famotidine
* Heparin sodium

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever of unknown origin and positive blood culture, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Embolic stroke: The patient has already experienced embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and there is a risk of further embolic events.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is severely depressed, and there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and there is a risk of developing metabolic acidosis.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is abnormal, and there is a risk of developing hypothyroidism.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is abnormal, and there is a risk of developing adrenal insufficiency.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including levophed and fluids, and consider weaning the patient off pressors as tolerated.
3. Consider repeating the patient's imaging studies, including CT and MRI, to assess for any changes in the patient's condition.
4. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis or encephalitis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider performing a stress test or echocardiogram to assess for any changes in the patient's cardiac function.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubating the patient if necessary.
7. Consider performing a thyroid function test to assess for any changes in the patient's thyroid function.
8. Consider performing an adrenal function test to assess for any changes in the patient's adrenal function."

   right frontal lobe, consistent with the previously demonstrated
   thromboembolic ischemic changes, and there is no evidence of
   hemorrhagic transformation, mass,mass effect, or shifting of the
   normally midline structures. Persistent prominent sulci at the left
   frontal region, followup in this area is recommended. If there is any
   clinical concern related with new ischemic area, correlation with MRI
   is recommended if clinically warranted.
   - repeat Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
   depressed (LVEF= 20-25%).  There is a very small pericardial effusion,
   no signs of tamponade.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2184-3-15**], ejection fraction is now severely depressed. The right
   ventricle, although not well seen, is dilated and hypokinetic. There is
   a small amount of pericardial fluid seen adjacent to the right atrium,
   without evidence of tamponade physiology.
   - MRI of C-spine and head: 1. Limited study due to motion. 2. No
   definite brainstem or cord signal abnormality. 3. Mild to moderate
   spinal canal stenosis at C3-4, with probable at least moderate neural
   foraminal narrowing at this level as well, though evaluation of the
   neural foramina is markedly limited due to motion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   -continue on cooling protocol to complete 18-24 hr duration, then
   re-warm
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending re-warming
   -c-spine MRI pending re-warming
   -consider LP when warmed
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5.1
 likely [**1-20**] to
   peripheral vasoconstriction).
   .
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well on current settings,
   hyperventilating as well.
   - on vent continue current settings
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   - d/c acyclovir
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).

   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man admitted with fevers and hypotension, who developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation. The patient has a complex medical history, including CAD, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, stage III, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive, and his neurological status is uncertain.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is 92.8°C (33.8°F), which is below normal.
3. Fever: The patient's fever curve has trended down, with a maximum temperature of 101.1°C (38.4°F).
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 104/50 mmHg, which is elevated.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 58 beats per minute, which is slow.
6. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29, which indicates respiratory acidosis.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is 5.1 mmol/L, which is elevated.
8. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's ejection fraction is severely depressed, and there is a small pericardial effusion.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated CK and CKMB levels, indicating cardiac damage.
2. Elevated troponin-T level, indicating cardiac damage.
3. Elevated lactate level, indicating metabolic acidosis.
4. Elevated CRP level, indicating inflammation.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is 7.8 mg/dL, which is low.
6. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is 2.0 mg/dL, which is low.
7. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate level is 6.9 mg/dL, which is elevated.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Embolic stroke: The patient has had two embolic strokes, which have resulted in significant neurological impairment.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is severely depressed, which may be contributing to his hypotension and respiratory acidosis.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may be contributing to his respiratory acidosis.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is below normal, which may be contributing to his altered mental status.
5. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, but the cause of his fever is still unknown.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Cooling protocol: The patient is being cooled to 34°C (93.2°F) to reduce his metabolic rate and improve his cardiac function.
2. Pressors: The patient is receiving levophed and fluids to support his blood pressure.
3. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving vancomycin and zosyn to treat his suspected sepsis.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving IVF and nutrition consult for tube feeds.
6. Glycemic control: The patient is receiving insulin to control his blood sugar levels.
7. Lactate monitoring: The patient's lactate level will be monitored regularly to assess his metabolic status.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  Had Femoral line with 1 postive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was started
   on [**3-25**]. Was cooled and then rewarmed.

   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1

   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. He had a prolonged cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has been undergoing an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He is currently being supported on levophed and fluids and is being cooled and rewarmed. The patient has a history of CAD, and his cardiac function is compromised.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and is at risk for respiratory failure due to his compromised cardiac function and potential respiratory acidosis.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has persistent metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 5.1, which may be due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload.
4. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
5. Embolic stroke: The patient has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, which may lead to further neurological complications.
6. Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient has hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, which may require further endocrine evaluation and treatment.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may require insulin therapy to control.
8. FEN (Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has FUO, which may require further evaluation and treatment to identify the underlying cause.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, which may require prophylactic measures.
10. Access: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, which may be at risk for complications, such as infection or dislodgement.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, and unresponsiveness. He was found pulseless and underwent resuscitation. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and his current condition is complicated by embolic hemorrhagic strokes, respiratory alkalosis, and metabolic acidosis. He is currently receiving pressor support and is being weaned off neosynephrine. The patient's fever curve has trended down, and he is being monitored for further fevers. His respiratory status is improving, and he is being weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to the embolic hemorrhagic strokes, which may lead to further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as seizures, coma, or even death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure if his lung function deteriorates further.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may indicate the presence of a coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may not be properly managed, leading to complications such as hypothyroidism-related symptoms, decreased cognitive function, or even cardiac complications.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function may not be properly managed, leading to complications such as adrenal crisis, hypotension, or even death.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as hypovolemic shock, bleeding into the peritoneum, or even death.
9. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as uremia, electrolyte imbalances, or even death.
10. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of his body, leading to complications such as sepsis, organ dysfunction, or even death.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  Had Femoral line with 1 postive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was started
   on [**3-25**]. Was cooled and then rewarmed.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending weaning of one pressor
   -c-spine MRI
   -consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5 and falling today to 2.2
   ..
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   - d/c acyclovir
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, fevers, and hypotension. He had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and was resuscitated. The patient has been undergoing extensive workup for FUO (fever of unknown origin) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes.

Current vital signs:

* HR: 75 bpm
* BP: 94/50 mmHg
* RR: 21 insp/min
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: SR (Sinus Rhythm)

The patient is receiving various medications, including vasopressors (levophed and phenylephrine), insulin, and anticoagulants (heparin). He is also receiving cooling protocol therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still on a ventilator and may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac arrest and PEA rhythm suggest potential cardiac dysfunction, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, which may indicate poor perfusion or cardiac dysfunction.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest potential sepsis, which may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of CAD and the presence of a femoral line with positive blood cultures suggest a risk of thromboembolic events.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's embolic hemorrhagic strokes and potential sepsis may lead to further neurological complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or stroke.
7. Infections: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase his risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or central line-associated bloodstream infections.
8. Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules may require further monitoring and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess for any changes in his condition.
2. Adjust his medications and treatment plan as necessary to manage his cardiac dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, and sepsis.
3. Consider performing a head CT or MRI to rule out further neurological complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary.
5. Consider performing a gallium scan or other imaging studies to evaluate for potential sources of infection or inflammation.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his electrolyte replacement therapy as necessary.
7. Consider performing a lumbar puncture (LP) to evaluate for potential central nervous system infections.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medication regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently in the ICU. They have undergone multiple interventions, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of liver disease and is currently receiving vasopressors and insulin. They have also undergone multiple lab tests, including blood cultures, which have revealed elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 222 mmHg. The patient is receiving 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and has a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 48.

The patient's neurological status is impaired, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8/15. They are unable to respond to verbal commands, move, or have normal tone.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with elevated liver enzymes, lipase levels, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated liver enzymes and lipase levels, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest a risk of developing AKI.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and PaO2 levels are concerning, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's impaired neurological status and elevated lactate levels suggest a risk of neurological deterioration.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest a risk of cardiovascular instability.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history and multiple comorbidities. They require close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   -start insulin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, admitted with fevers and hypotension, and later developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: HR 75 bpm, BP 94/50 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Neurological status: Unresponsive, no movement or tone assessment
* Hemodynamic status: Pressor-dependent, able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight
* Respiratory status: Oxygenating well, improving RSBI, on ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode
* Metabolic status: Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
* Fever curve: Trending down, with a maximum temperature of 100.1°F
* Laboratory results: WBC 28.8 K/uL, Hct 31.1%, Plt 147 K/uL, Cr 1.8 mg/dL, Glucose 297 mg/dL
* Radiology results: Negative for acute bleed on head CT
* Plan:
	+ Continue to monitor fever curve, CRP, and lactate
	+ F/u neuro recs, consider LP when stable
	+ Trend lactate
	+ Maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
	+ Continue to wean from ventilator
	+ Consider gallium scan if patient spikes another true fever
	+ F/u TFTs in 2 weeks
	+ Endocrine follow-up

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and further cardiac events may occur.
* Sepsis: The patient's fevers and metabolic acidosis may indicate sepsis, which could worsen if not addressed.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but further respiratory complications may arise if the ventilator weaning process is not managed properly.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not addressed, potentially leading to further cardiac and respiratory complications.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and further deterioration may occur if not managed properly.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and pressor dependence may increase the risk of bleeding complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and addressing any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] undergoing extensive workup for FUO with
   interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found
   unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   #Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The first documented rhythm
   was PEA.  patient was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing CPR and
   NaHCO3 and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome
   during the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause.  Lactate during the code was 8.1.  he is currently being
   supported on levophed and fluids.  CE was elevated as expected, but not
   down trending.  He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of
   head.  New RIJ was started but femoral TL was not pulled (1 positive
   blood culture from the femoral site
 GPC in clusters).
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   -continue on cooling protocol to complete 18-24 hr duration, then
   re-warm
   -f/u bld, urine cx
   -head imaging pending re-warming
   -c-spine MRI pending re-warming
   -consider LP when warmed
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate (presistently elevated to 5.1
 likely [**1-20**] to
   peripheral vasoconstriction).
   .
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of
   #Respiratory status: oxygenating well on current settings,
   hyperventilating as well.
   - on vent continue current settings
   .
   #Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.29/30/79.  likely due to cardiac
   disfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors
   and cooling
   - cont. cooling protocol
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated after re-warming starting with
   neo
   .
   #Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   - d/c acyclovir
   .
   #embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   -start insulin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. He was found unresponsive and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His cardiac status is unstable, with a recent embolic stroke and cardiac arrest. He has also been diagnosed with bacteremia, likely related to line placement.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Lactic acid: 5.1 mmol/L (elevated)
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (elevated)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 37 mg/dL (elevated)
* Glucose: 297 mg/dL (elevated)
* White blood cell count (WBC): 28.8 K/uL (elevated)
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.1 g/dL (elevated)
* Platelet count (Plt): 147 K/uL (elevated)

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including:

* Vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin)
* Antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin, and acyclovir)
* Insulin
* Anticoagulants (heparin)
* Pain medication (none listed)
* Sedatives (none listed)

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Cardiac instability: The patient has had a recent embolic stroke and cardiac arrest, and his cardiac status is unstable.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated, which can indicate poor perfusion and cardiac dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which can increase the risk of complications such as infections and organ damage.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is cool, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status can increase the risk of complications such as falls and aspiration.

ICU care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, and a nutrition consult is recommended.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is elevated, and insulin therapy is recommended.
3. Lines: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulants.
5. VAP prevention: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and measures such as elevating the head of the bed and performing daily wake-up tests are recommended."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a stable respiratory status.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) of unclear etiology. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history, but periodically lifts his arms and opens his eyes to sternal rub.

The patient's cardiovascular status is critical, with a history of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. The patient remains on vasopressors to support blood pressure, and a cooling protocol was completed after the cardiac arrest.

The patient has a history of bacteremia attributed to line placement during the cardiac arrest, and is being treated with antimicrobials.

The patient's metabolic status is concerning, with metabolic acidosis and lactate levels of 5.1. This is likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload from the pressors and cooling.

The patient's infection status is unclear, with a diagnosis of FUO (fever of unknown origin) and an ongoing evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has had multiple CVAs and is at risk for further neurological damage.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has had a cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac events.
4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and is at risk for further infections.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to continue unless the underlying cardiac dysfunction is addressed.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has received significant amounts of fluids and is at risk for fluid overload.
7. Renal failure: The patient's metabolic acidosis and lactate levels are concerning for potential renal failure.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and metabolic status. The patient will continue to receive antimicrobial therapy for bacteremia and will be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition will also be closely monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated starting with neo
   - repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted with fevers and hypotension, and subsequently developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, and pulseless. The patient was resuscitated and is currently undergoing extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on ventilator support with CPAP/PSV mode, and oxygenation is improving, with a RSBI of 31.
* Hemodynamic: The patient is still requiring pressor support, with vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions, and is able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight.
* Neurological: The patient is unresponsive, with no assessment of movement, tone, or skin.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 28.8, Hct 31.1, Plt 147
	+ Blood chemistry: Glucose 126, Creatinine 1.9, Potassium 4.4, Calcium 7.1
	+ Other lab results: Troponin-T 0.06, ALT 29, AST 74, Alk Phos 138, Lactic Acid 3.0 mmol/L

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's RSBI is 31, which is concerning for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as evidenced by his need for pressor support and cardiac enzymes.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin and laboratory results suggesting hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia increase the risk of sepsis.
* Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of CAD and current anticoagulation therapy with subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's current metabolic acidosis, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow, needs to be closely monitored and managed.
* Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia, likely due to renal disease and poor PO, contributes to intravascular volume and pressure problems.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue pressor support and wean as tolerated
* Repeat LENIs to rule out possible PE contributing to event
* F/u blood and urine cultures
* Brain and C-spine MRI today
* Consider LP when stable
* Trend lactate
* Maintain pressors and wean as tolerated
* Continue to monitor fever curve
* F/u CRP
* Consider LP
* Continue ASA and statin
* Hold BB given hypotension

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated, now vasopressor
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ULTRASOUND - At [**2184-3-27**] 11:12 PM
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2184-3-28**] 05:13 AM routine ordered w AM labs
   - weaned off neo, still on high doses of levophed / vasopressin
   - patient's activity level improved over course of day, started opening
   eyes and moving arms spontaneously
   - MRI allows only two infusions at a time: concern that he would need
   bolus sedation before scan, and if that dropped his pressures not much
   could be done because he was on near-max of two pressors, so delayed
   MRI for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted with fevers and hypotension, and has undergone extensive workup for FUO with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on ventilator support with CPAP/PSV mode, and is oxygenating well with an FiO2 of 40%. The RSBI is improving.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is still requiring pressor support, with vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions. The blood pressure is 93/48 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient is not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic function.
* Hematological: The patient has a WBC count of 28.8, Hct of 31.1, and Plt of 147.
* Renal: The patient has a creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 37 mg/dL.
* Metabolic: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 17, and a lactate level of 3.0 mmol/L.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, and is being managed with IVF and repletion of electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a high WBC count and is on antibiotics, which increases the risk of sepsis.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, which may lead to further decompensation.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support, and may require further weaning or escalation of respiratory support.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are elevated, which may indicate renal failure.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is elevated, which may indicate a metabolic acidosis that requires further management.
* Endocrine dysfunction: The patient's hypoalbuminemia may indicate endocrine dysfunction, which requires further evaluation and management.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care should include:

* Continued monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values
* Maintenance of pressor support and weaning as tolerated
* Continued respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode
* Management of metabolic acidosis with IVF and repletion of electrolytes
* Endocrine evaluation and management
* Renal evaluation and management
* Sepsis evaluation and management
* Cardiac function evaluation and management
* Respiratory function evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] undergoing extensive workup for FUO with
   interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found
   unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asytole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo)
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis, but otherwise unclear.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology.  Continue
   evaluation as outlined.   Consider multiple embolic events, such as
   endocarditis.  Awaiting MRI of spine to assess for spinal cord lesion.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Creatinine (Cr): 1.9 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 17 mmHg
* Glucose: 126 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results include elevated lactate, ALT, AST, and LDH levels, as well as low albumin and calcium levels.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest with possible PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity)
* Sepsis
* Neurological impairment with evidence of multiple cerebral vasculitis
* Bacteremia attributed to line placement
* Metabolic acidosis
* Renal failure with non-oliguric acute kidney injury
* Hyponatremia
* Hyperglycemia

The patient's medications include:

* Vasopressors
* Fentanyl
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Acyclovir
* Vancomycin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] undergoing extensive workup for FUO with
   interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found
   unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asytole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in study (receiving either steroid vs placebo)
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis, but otherwise unclear.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology.  Continue
   evaluation as outlined.   Consider multiple embolic events, such as
   endocarditis.  Awaiting MRI of spine.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS, monitor Na.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, with stable vital signs and SaO2 of 99%. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is receiving treatment for bacteremia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hypotension, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with evidence of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and unclear etiology. The patient is also at risk for sepsis, with a history of bacteremia and line placement. The patient's metabolic status is also concerning, with hypotension, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with SaO2 of 99% and no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's cardiovascular status is also stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute and blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin-T, indicating possible sepsis and cardiac injury. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 30.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medication regimen includes antibiotics, vasopressors, and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and treatment for hyperglycemia.

The patient's ICU care plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, monitoring of SaO2, and management of bacteremia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the patient is expected to remain in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of bacteremia and line placement puts them at risk for sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and cardiac injury may increase their risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they may be at risk for respiratory failure if their underlying condition worsens.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and they may be at risk for further deterioration.
5. Neurological decline: The patient's neurological status is concerning, and they may be at risk for further decline if their underlying condition is not addressed.
6. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and line placement may increase their risk for infection.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if their underlying condition is not addressed.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if their underlying condition is not addressed.

In conclusion, this patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their underlying conditions to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
 dc vancomycin as coag neg
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - f/u Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Thrombocytopoenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above

   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.

   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man admitted with fevers and hypotension, who developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless. He was resuscitated and currently undergoes extensive workup for FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin). The patient is on pressor support, weaned off neosynephrine overnight, and is requiring ongoing management for thrombocytopenia, respiratory status, metabolic acidosis, and fevers of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 201 to 72, likely due to drug-related causes or DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation). This may affect his prognosis.
2. Respiratory Status: The patient is on ventilatory support and is improving, but requires continued weaning.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload due to pressors and cooling, which may contribute to his metabolic acidosis.
4. Fevers of Unknown Origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, but he is still off antibiotics. Further monitoring and consideration of gallium scan or LP (Lumbar Puncture) may be necessary.
5. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's renal disease and poor PO intake may contribute to his hypoalbuminemia, which may affect his intravascular volume and pressure.
6. Embolic Stroke: The patient is continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology, and consideration of Holter monitoring on discharge may be necessary.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient requires insulin sliding scale management to control his blood sugar levels.
8. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's history of CAD and chronic kidney disease may increase his risk of thrombotic complications.
9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of CAD and chronic kidney disease may also increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.
10. Infection: The patient's fevers of unknown origin and history of respiratory alkalosis may increase his risk of infection.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing management and monitoring for these potential complications to ensure optimal care and improvement in his clinical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacle to extubation currently altered mental status.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.  Awaiting final read of
   MRI of spine to assess for spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and is currently experiencing hypotension, neurological impairment, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, hypornatremia, hyperglycemia, and unclear etiology of fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, aspiration, or worsening lung injury can lead to further respiratory decline.
2. Cardiac arrest: Recurrent cardiac arrest or arrhythmias can occur, particularly in the presence of underlying cardiac disease.
3. Neurological impairment: Stroke, cerebral edema, or sepsis can lead to worsening neurological deficits or even death.
4. Bacteremia: Sepsis, septic shock, or endocarditis can occur, particularly in the presence of central lines or other invasive devices.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, can occur.
6. Metabolic acidosis: Lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or other metabolic disturbances can worsen respiratory or cardiac function.
7. Renal failure: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or uremic syndrome can develop, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
8. Hypornatremia: Hyponatremic seizures, cerebral edema, or other complications can occur, particularly in the presence of SIADH or other disorders of water balance.
9. Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, or other complications can develop, particularly in the presence of diabetes or impaired glucose regulation.
10. Fever of unknown origin: Sepsis, endocarditis, or other infections can develop, particularly in the presence of underlying comorbidities or immunocompromise.

The patient's current treatment plan includes mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, antibiotics, and supportive care. Close monitoring and adjustment of treatment are necessary to address these potential complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacle to extubation currently altered mental status.
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.  Awaiting final read of
   MRI of spine to assess for spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  Consider HIT,
   ,medication effect, consumptive.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.  Awaiting final read of
   MRI of spine to assess for spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  Consider HIT,
   ,medication effect, consumptive.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Notable for prior lactate of 5.1, now
   improving.  Would repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control.  Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He was found unresponsive and pulseless, and was resuscitated. He has a history of cardiac arrest, embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and sepsis.

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a stable respiratory status. However, the main obstacle to extubation is his altered mental status. He has a history of multiple CVAs, and possible endocarditis is being considered. He also has bacteremia attributed to line placement during cardiac arrest.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored. He has metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and hypotension, which are being managed accordingly. He has hyperglycemia, which has improved with insulin infusion. He is receiving nutritional support and is being monitored for fever.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and sepsis, there is a risk of further septic episodes.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and sepsis, which increases the risk of cardiovascular instability.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has multiple CVAs and possible endocarditis, which increases the risk of further neurological complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is being monitored, but there is a risk of further decline in platelet count.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which increases the risk of further renal deterioration.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is being managed, but there is a risk of further acidosis.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is being managed, but there is a risk of further hypotension.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   2. Bilateral pleural effusions. Please correlate with chest
   radiographs.
   MRI HEAD IMPRESSION:
   1. Multiple new foci of restricted diffusion scattered throughout both
   cerebral hemispheres suggestive of a combination of watershed and
   embolic events.
   2. Cortical FLAIR hyperintensities in the biparietal cortices
   suggestive of an hypoxic event.

   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified on [**2184-3-29**] at 10 a.m.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin, famotidine
   - get DIC/TTP labs for now
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.

   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

**Medical History:**

* Patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of CAD, chronic kidney disease, stage III, and hyperlipidemia.
* He was admitted on [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension, and later developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, unresponsiveness, and pulseless arrest.

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO (fever of unknown origin) with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes.
* He is still requiring pressor support and has a moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at C3-4 secondary to a broad-based disc protrusion without evidence of cord signal abnormality.
* The patient has a stepwise decline in platelet count, which is likely due to drug-related thrombocytopenia (zosyn, heparin, or vancomycin) or TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).
* He has a metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation and is being treated with pressors and cooling.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's fever of unknown origin and increased protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggest the possibility of an infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
2. **Thrombotic events:** The patient's thrombocytopenia and embolic hemorrhagic strokes increase the risk of further thrombotic events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism.
3. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he still requires ventilator support, which increases the risk of respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. **Kidney injury:** The patient's chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from antibiotics and other medications increase the risk of kidney injury and acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. **Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules:** The patient's hypoalbuminemia and potential adrenal insufficiency increase the risk of hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, which could lead to cardiovascular and metabolic complications.
6. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, and other metabolic complications.
7. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and brain.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fever curve, CSF results, and TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) to determine the cause of his FUO and potential infections.
2. Manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with discontinuation of potential offending medications and consideration of platelet transfusions.
3. Wean the patient off pressors and cooling as tolerated.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation if possible.
5. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin sliding scale and nutrition consult for tube feeds.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider nephrotoxicity from antibiotics and other medications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and consider thyroid replacement therapy if necessary.
8. Consider a rheum consult to evaluate the patient's potential autoimmune disorders.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider a stress test or echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function.
10. Consider a nutrition consult to evaluate the patient's nutritional status and potential need for tube feeds."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli

   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fevers and hypotension. He has a past medical history of CAD, and was found unresponsive and pulseless on admission. He was resuscitated and is currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin). The patient has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and is receiving treatment for this condition.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (86-106)
* Blood pressure: 112/60 mmHg (72-122/74-99)
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (17-26)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 30.5 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 72 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 193 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 187 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* MRI of the head: multiple new foci of restricted diffusion suggestive of embolic events, cortical FLAIR hyperintensities suggestive of hypoxic event, and stable central and cortical involutional changes.
* MRI of the neck: moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at C3-4 secondary to a broad-based disc protrusion without evidence of cord signal abnormality, and multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Thrombocytopenia: platelet count is 72 x 10^9/L, with a stepwise decline from 201 x 10^9/L on admission.
* Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving respiratory system resistance.
* Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation.
* Fevers of unknown origin: fever curve has trended down, and the patient is currently off antibiotics.
* Hypoalbuminemia: likely due to renal disease and poor oral intake.
* Embolic stroke: the patient is receiving treatment for this condition.

The patient's medications include:

* Norepinephrine: 0.15 mcg/kg/min
* Famotidine: 20 mg orally once daily
* Fentanyl: 2 mcg/kg/hour
* Vancomycin: discontinued
* Zosyn: discontinued
* Aspirin: 81 mg orally once daily
* Pravastatin: 40 mg orally once daily
* Insulin sliding scale: for hyperglycemia

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: the patient has a fever of unknown origin, and is at risk for developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: the patient has a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: the patient has a history of CAD, and is at risk for developing cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: the patient has a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and is at risk for developing renal failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient has a history of bleeding, and is at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing aspirin and pravastatin for embolic stroke.
* Weaning pressors as tolerated.
* Monitoring fever curve.
* Following up on CSF results.
* Performing a TEE to look for a potential source of emboli.
* Trending lactate levels.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
* Maintaining glycemic control.
* Repleting electrolytes.
* Providing nutrition consult for tube feeds.
* Continuing prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Following up with the patient's primary care physician and endocrinologist."

   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified on [**2184-3-29**] at 10 a.m.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old man admitted with fevers and hypotension, who developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes and was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless. He was resuscitated and is currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO (fever of unknown origin). The patient has a complex medical history, including CAD (coronary artery disease), chronic kidney disease, stage III, hyperlipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient remains hemodynamically unstable, requiring pressor support, and is still recovering from a prolonged PEA (pulsus paradoxus) arrest.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased stepwise from 201 to 72, which may be related to drug-induced thrombocytopenia, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), or TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).
3. Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and improving, with a plan to wean from the ventilator and diurese as tolerated.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload.
5. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and the ID (infectious disease) team recommends a gallium scan only if he spikes another true fever.
6. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is likely due to renal disease and poor PO (oral intake), contributing to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
7. Embolic stroke: The patient is continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology, with a plan to consider a holter on discharge and follow neuro recommendations.
8. Other conditions: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease, stage III.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and hypotension may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's fevers of unknown origin and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address any potential issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.
   - vancomycin, zosyn
 dc vancomycin as coag neg
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx
   - f/u Brain and C-spine MRI today
   - consider LP when stable
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Thrombocytopoenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1
 last abg 7.38/28/111. likely due to
   cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow + increased afterload due to
   pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CRP
   -- consider LP
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - insulin sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.

   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fevers and hypotension. He has a history of CAD and was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation.

The patient has undergone extensive workup for FUO (fever of unknown origin) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He is currently undergoing treatment for various conditions, including:

1. Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: The patient is still requiring pressor support, although he was able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his hemodynamic instability.
2. Thrombocytopoenia: The patient's platelet count is 72, which is a stepwise decline from 201 on the previous day. The most likely possibility is drug-related (zosyn vs heparin vs vancomycin), but it could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT) or TTP. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his thrombocytopenia.
3. Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and has improved RSBI (respiratory system compliance index). He should continue to be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.
4. Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: The patient's lactate level is 7.38, which is likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload due to pressors and cooling. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his metabolic acidosis.
5. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and he is currently off antibiotics. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his fevers.
6. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is likely due to renal disease and poor PO. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his hypoalbuminemia.
7. Embolic stroke: The patient is continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address his embolic stroke.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and hypotension make him susceptible to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still requiring pressor support, which can increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction, as evidenced by his lactate level, can lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia make him susceptible to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's fevers and hypoalbuminemia make him susceptible to infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's chronic kidney disease, stage III, makes him susceptible to further renal dysfunction, which can lead to end-stage renal disease.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's embolic stroke and thrombocytopenia make him susceptible to further neurological complications, such as stroke or bleeding.

Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.

   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man admitted to the ICU with fevers and hypotension, later diagnosed with embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He remains on pressor support and is being weaned off neosynephrine. Lab results show thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia. He has a history of CAD, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, and he remains on pressor support. This increases the risk of cardiac arrest and morbidity.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is declining, which may lead to bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he remains on ventilatory support. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and respiratory failure may occur.
5. Infection: The patient's fevers of unknown origin may be indicative of an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition if not properly treated.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and cardiac arrest increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.
8. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis may worsen his renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's embolic strokes may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebral edema.
10. Sepsis: The patient's fever and laboratory results may indicate sepsis, which could worsen his condition if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust pressor support as needed.
2. Manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and monitor for bleeding complications.
3. Correct the patient's metabolic acidosis with appropriate treatments, such as sodium bicarbonate and insulin.
4. Wean the patient off the ventilator gradually, monitoring for respiratory failure.
5. Investigate the patient's fevers of unknown origin and treat any underlying infections promptly.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust medication and nutritional support as needed.
7. Manage the patient's cardiac complications with close monitoring and treatment of arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.
8. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed to prevent acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
9. Monitor the patient's neurological function and adjust treatment as needed to prevent neurological complications.
10. Consider sepsis protocols and antimicrobial therapy if the patient's condition worsens or if sepsis is suspected."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and multiple embolic strokes. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, with stable vital signs. His neurological status is improving, but he remains somnulant and intermittently responsive to commands. He has a history of cardiac disease, including a recent cardiac arrest, and is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including a recent cardiac arrest. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient has had multiple embolic strokes, which may lead to further neurological deficits. There is also a risk of cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizures.
4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, which may lead to septic shock, organ failure, and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is declining, which may lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymosis, and hematomas.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and multi-organ failure.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which may lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs, such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infection.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. His respiratory status should be closely monitored, and his ventilator settings adjusted as needed. His cardiac status should also be monitored, and his blood pressure maintained within a normal range. His neurological status should be monitored, and his platelet count checked regularly. His metabolic acidosis should be managed with sodium bicarbonate and other supportive measures. His renal function should be monitored, and his fluid balance maintained. His hyperglycemia should be managed with insulin and other medications. His nutritional needs should be met with total parenteral nutrition (TPN)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> improving; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Await repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> improving; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Await repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and multiple embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a stable respiratory status. He has a history of cardiac disease, and his cardiac arrest was likely related to a combination of factors, including sepsis, hypotension, and possible endocarditis. He also has evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents, unclear etiology, and possible CNS vasculitis.

The patient has a range of laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and hyperglycemia. He has a history of fluid overload and is at risk for further complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

Plan:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor SaO2.
* Continue antimicrobials and await repeat TEE.
* Monitor platelet count and consider HIT, medication effect, or consumptive coagulopathy.
* Check peripheral blood smear for anemia.
* Monitor urine output, BUN, and creatinine for renal failure.
* Provide NS constant infusion and monitor serial Na for hypornatremia.
* Maintain glucose <150 and monitor for hyperglycemia.
* Initiate TF for nutritional support.
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID
   - consider steroid replacement therapy
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershe stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with fevers and hypotension. He has undergone an extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent improvement in respiratory syncytial virus (RSBI) score.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient requires pressor support and has been weaned off neosynephrine overnight.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 201 to 72, with a stepwise decline. The most likely cause is drug-related, possibly due to zosyn, heparin, or vancomycin.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, which may be due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload.
* Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and he is currently on vancomycin and zosyn. The ID team is planning to pursue a gallium scan when the patient is stable.
* Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia due to renal disease and poor oral intake, which may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
* Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient is on aspirin and pravastatin per neurology, and consideration is being given to a holter monitor on discharge.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of central lines and arterial lines may increase the risk of infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's embolic hemorrhagic strokes may increase the risk of further neurological complications, such as seizures or brain edema.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis and hypoalbuminemia may worsen, leading to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Weaning off pressors and intubation
2. Continuing antibiotic therapy
3. Monitoring for bleeding and infection
4. Managing cardiac dysfunction and hypotension
5. Monitoring for neurological and respiratory complications
6. Managing metabolic acidosis and hypoalbuminemia
7. Pursuing further diagnostic testing, such as a gallium scan, to determine the cause of the patient's fever of unknown origin."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased significantly, which may lead to bleeding complications. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia, and treatment options should be considered.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has required pressor support and has had a prolonged period of hypotension, which may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability. Continued monitoring and management of blood pressure are necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and has a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, indicating respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator should be done carefully to avoid complications.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 3.4 mmol/L, which may indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction or other systemic issues. Continued monitoring of lactate levels and acid-base status is necessary.
5. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, but the cause of the fever is still unknown. Further investigation, including a gallium scan, is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the fever.
6. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's albumin level is low, which may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems. Nutritional support and management of fluid balance are necessary.
7. Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient has had embolic and watershed strokes, and continued monitoring of neurological status is necessary. Consideration of further imaging studies, such as a CT or MRI, may be necessary to determine the extent of the stroke.
8. Hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules: The patient has hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, and further evaluation and management by an endocrinologist are necessary.
9. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, stage III, and continued monitoring of kidney function is necessary.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, and insulin sliding scale therapy may be necessary to manage blood glucose levels.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including thrombocytopenia, hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, fevers of unknown origin, hypoalbuminemia, embolic vs watershed stroke, hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, chronic kidney disease, and hyperglycemia. Continued close monitoring and management of these conditions are necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID
   - consider steroid replacement therapy
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershe stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a past medical history of CAD, admitted with fevers and hypotension. He has developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and was found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He is currently undergoing an extensive workup for FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin) and has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, likely related to drug therapy (zosyn vs heparin vs vancomycin), DIC (unlikely given stable HCT), or TTP.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, pressor support, and is being treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) for suspected sepsis. He has also been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis, likely related to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow.

Potential medical complications:

1. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, and the presence of an arterial line may increase the risk of thrombosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if his platelet count continues to decline.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or other complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's suspected sepsis may progress, leading to multi-organ failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or other complications.
6. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems, increasing the risk of bleeding or other complications.
7. Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient's embolic vs watershed stroke may lead to further neurological complications.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or other complications.
9. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Wean the patient off pressor support and mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
3. Continue to treat the patient's suspected sepsis with antibiotics and consider adding antifungal therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and consider adjusting therapy as necessary.
5. Consider adding steroids to the patient's treatment regimen to address potential adrenal insufficiency.
6. Monitor the patient's hypoalbuminemia and consider adding albumin to his treatment regimen.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent further embolic events.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin, famotidine
   - get DIC/TTP labs for now
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   * CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   * Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   * Chronic kidney disease, stage III - Stable.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   - insulin sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands.
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued per ID
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/up neuro recs
   - trend lactate
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - TEE today to look for potential source of emboli
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 72, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis
   - trend
   - DC heparin, vancomycin, famotidine
   - get DIC/TTP labs for now
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would not pursue gallium scan unless
   spikes a true fever. Continues to be off antibiotics. Per primary team,
   ID recomends gallium scan if he spikes another true fever, Rheum does
   not feel this ios consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team
   feels that he is adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with
   steroids at this point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular
   marrow and not myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   * Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of CAD, admitted with fevers and hypotension, and is currently undergoing an extensive workup for FUO with interval development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes. The patient has experienced a PEA arrest and has been resuscitated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI, on vent and weaning
* Cardiovascular status: pressor-dependent, with a platelet count of 72, and thrombocytopenia
* Neurological status: mental status has improved, intermittently follows commands, with a TEE failed due to inability to pass the probe into the esophagus
* Metabolic status: metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, with a lactate level of 3.4 mmol/L
* Fever: trending down, with a T max of 100.1, and a fever curve showing a possible spike
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP of 9 mmHg, and a total in/out balance of -1260 mL
* Laboratory results: platelet count of 72, WBC of 30.5, Hct of 28.1, Cr of 2.1, and TCO2 of 18

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Thrombocytopenia: may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage
* Metabolic acidosis: may lead to cardiac dysfunction, respiratory failure, and increased mortality
* Respiratory failure: may lead to increased mortality, particularly if not adequately ventilated
* Cardiovascular instability: may lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and decreased perfusion to vital organs
* Infection: may lead to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and increased mortality
* Coagulopathy: may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage
* Hyperglycemia: may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and increased mortality

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning pressors and diuretics as tolerated
* Trending lactate and CSF cultures
* F/u neuro recs
* Considering holter on discharge
* F/u TFTs in 2 weeks
* F/u endocrine follow-up
* Continuing ASA, statin, and insulin sliding scale
* Monitoring for hyperglycemia and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Monitoring for bleeding complications and adjusting treatment as necessary"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 105.5 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour history of worsening thrombocytopenia, despite being held on PPI/H2 blockers. The patient has been receiving Vanc/Zosyn for 10 days, with a planned restart of Vanc in the morning. The patient's 4T's score is 5, indicating a high risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and heparin-dependent antibodies have been sent for testing. The patient's TEE was unsuccessful due to inability to pass the probe into the esophagus. The patient is on a ventilator with PSV/SBT mode, and his respiratory support is being adjusted based on his SpO2 and RSBI.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/61 mmHg. His laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 55 K/uL, and his coagulation studies are abnormal, with a PT of 15.1 seconds and a PTT of 31.8 seconds. His liver function tests are abnormal, with an ALT of 29 IU/L and an AST of 74 IU/L. His blood glucose level is 193 mg/dL, and his other laboratory results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: The patient's 4T's score is 5, indicating a high risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. If left untreated, this could lead to life-threatening bleeding or thrombotic complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies, including a prolonged PT and PTT, indicate a risk of bleeding or thrombotic complications.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests, including an elevated ALT and AST, indicate potential liver damage or dysfunction.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 193 mg/dL is elevated, indicating a risk of hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and his respiratory support adjustments indicate a risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
6. Sepsis: The patient's abnormal laboratory results, including an elevated WBC count and CRP, indicate a risk of sepsis.
7. DIC: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies and thrombocytopenia indicate a risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,
   monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and multiple embolic hemorrhagic strokes. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a favorable RSBI. He remains on vasopressor support, but his neurological exam is variable, occasionally responding to commands and other times remaining unresponsive. He has a history of CAD, embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he requires continued mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not optimized or if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and he is at risk of recurrent cardiac arrest. He has a history of CAD and embolic hemorrhagic strokes, which may have contributed to his cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition. He is at risk of developing septic shock, organ failure, and death.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is variable, and he may be at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or spinal cord injury.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is a life-threatening condition. He is at risk of bleeding, and his platelet count must be closely monitored.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to his underlying medical condition or medication side effects. He is at risk of developing further anemia, which may worsen his overall condition.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is a condition that can worsen his respiratory and cardiac status. He is at risk of developing further acidosis, which may require treatment with bicarbonate or other interventions.
8. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which is a life-threatening condition. He is at risk of developing further kidney damage, and his renal function must be closely monitored.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is a condition that can worsen his neurological status. He is at risk of developing further hyponatremia, which may require treatment with hypertonic saline or other interventions.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is a condition that can worsen his cardiovascular and neurological status. He is at risk of developing further hyperglycemia, which may require treatment with insulin or other interventions.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment to manage his multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- dramatic decline, continued.  Recent Bone Marrow
   without evidence for megakaroycyte defect.  Monitor Plts.  Consider
   HIT, ,medication effect, consumptive.  D/C heparin products and all
   non-essential medications that could be
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Would provide NS constant infusion,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and subsequent development of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is receiving treatment for sepsis, hypotension, and thrombocytopenia. He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hyponatremia.

Assessment and Plan:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is stable on current settings, but main obstacles to extubation are altered mental status and fluid balance.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has undergone cardiac arrest with asystole as the initial rhythm, and has been enrolled in a research study (receiving either steroid vs placebo).
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed in part to sepsis, and is being managed with vasopressors.
* Neurological: The patient has evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents, unclear etiology, and possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.
* Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia attributed to line placement during cardiac arrest, and is receiving antimicrobial therapy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is dramatic and ongoing, and is being monitored.
* Anemia: The patient has progressive anemia, and concern for drug effect is present.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, but would repeat if necessary.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and is being monitored.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia due to total body water overload, and would check serum and urine osmoles, urine electrolytes, and provide normal saline infusion.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin infusion, and glucose levels are being monitored.
* Nutritional support: The patient is to receive total parenteral nutrition (TF).

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and decreased cardiac output.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and decreased cardiac output.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and death.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest and death.

ICU care:

* Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TF) is to be initiated.
* Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are to be monitored and managed with insulin infusion.
* Lines: The patient has a multi-lumen line and an arterial line in place.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Communication: The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the patient is to be transferred to the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID for total 10 day course; today is day 9
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 42, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Likely HIT (given pos ab).
   - trend
   - re-involve heme; consider direct thrombin inhibitor
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   # CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   # AOCRF
 Now with uptrending creatinine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro rec - ASA 325 started, not likely vasculitis, likely watershed
   area.
   - started zyprexa today
   - family meeting - still coping with patient condition, continue
   evaluation.
   - adrenal insufficient - on post-arrest study, will empirically treat
   with steroids right now - okayed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 402**]. (100 hydrocort TID)
   - touch base heme/onc regarding anemia and thrombocytopenia (run by ID
   attending) - waiting recs - getting typical dic/hit labs.
   - qeustion EEG for eval of the mental status
   - HIT ab positive, send off serotonin release assay.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted with fevers and hypotension, and has since developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and pulseless, requiring resuscitation. He is currently in the ICU, requiring pressor support and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications and diagnoses. Some of the key issues include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased stepwise from 201 to 42, and is likely due to HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). This will require further evaluation and management.
2. Respiratory status: The patient is oxygenating well and improving RSBI, but will require continued weaning of ventilator support and diuresis as tolerated.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and poor forward flow. Pressors will need to be maintained, and the patient will need to be weaned as tolerated.
4. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, but the etiology is still unknown. Further evaluation, including a gallium scan, will be necessary to determine the cause.
5. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient's hypoalbuminemia is likely due to renal disease and poor PO intake, which may contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
6. Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient has had an embolic stroke, and further evaluation, including a TEE, will be necessary to determine the extent of the damage.
7. Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient's thyroid function tests are normal, but he has adrenal nodules, which may require further evaluation and management.
8. CAD, native vessel: The patient has CAD, which will require continued ASA and statin therapy.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which will require continued statin therapy.
10. AOCRF: The patient's creatinine is uptrending, which will require further evaluation and management.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to his ongoing fevers and unknown etiology
* Respiratory failure due to his ongoing respiratory distress
* Cardiac arrest due to his ongoing cardiac dysfunction
* Renal failure due to his uptrending creatinine
* Thrombotic events due to his thrombocytopenia and potential HIT
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to his hypoalbuminemia and poor PO intake
* Worsening of his neurological status due to his ongoing embolic stroke and potential watershed damage.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID for total 10 day course; today is day 9
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 42, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-continued per
   ID for total 10 day course; today is day 9

   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 42, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Most likely possibility is drug related (zosyn vs
   heparin vs vancomycin), could also be DIC (unlikely given stable HCT)
   or TTP. Unclear if this affects his prognosis. DIC/TTP labs
   unconcerning.
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine, consider re-d/c vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI
   - on vent continue to wean
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   - rationalize abx
 currently on vanc, zosyn , cultures pending
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   -- TEE
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and presented with fevers and hypotension. He developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, was found unresponsive, and underwent resuscitation.

The patient is currently receiving pressor support with norepinephrine and levophed, and is being weaned off the ventilator. He has a history of thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts declining from 201 to 42, and is being treated with platelet transfusions.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels are not elevated, and he is being empirically treated with steroids. This could lead to adrenal crisis if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is being weaned off the ventilator, but may still require respiratory support.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate level, which can be caused by cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload.
5. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient has a fever that has trended down, but the etiology is still unclear. This could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has low albumin levels, which can contribute to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
7. Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient has had embolic and watershed strokes, which can increase the risk of further neurological complications.
8. Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient has hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, which can lead to further endocrine complications if not properly managed.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   medical condition, answered all questions.  All agree that patient
   would not chronic mechanical ventilation, and would not want to
   continue high level of support for prolonged period.  Currently patient
   has been breathing with minimal ventilator support, and and is
   otherwise medically ready for extubation but has remained intubated due
   to somnulant mental status.  All agree that patient has undergone
   extensive testing and interventions, and that clearly there has been
   overall clinical decline, includine significant neurological deficit
   (as indicated by head MRI).  All clearly state that patient would not
   want additional interventions if no promise for complete recovery.  All
   agree to proceed with extubation currently, despite somnulant mental
   status in hope that patient will be comfortable and may be able to
   protect airway.  If clinical status declines following extubation, no
   plans for reintubation or resussitation as previously discussed, with
   focus of care then on comfort.  Plan to proceed with extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Extensive discussion with wife [**Name (NI) 117**] and other family members.  Updated
   medical condition, answered all questions.  All agree that patient
   would not chronic mechanical ventilation, and would not want to
   continue high level of support for prolonged period.  Currently patient
   has been breathing with minimal ventilator support, and and is
   otherwise medically ready for extubation but has remained intubated due
   to somnulant mental status.  All agree that patient has undergone
   extensive testing and interventions, and that clearly there has been
   overall clinical decline, includine significant neurological deficit
   (as indicated by head MRI).  All clearly state that patient would not
   want additional interventions if no promise for complete recovery.  All
   agree to proceed with extubation currently, despite somnulant mental
   status in hope that patient will be comfortable and may be able to
   protect airway.  If clinical status declines following extubation, no
   plans for reintubation or resussitation as previously discussed, with
   focus of care then on comfort.  Plan to proceed with extubation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic strokes. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a stable respiratory status.

The patient's neurological status is somnulant, with altered mental status and decreased tone. The patient is unable to stand and has bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count: 25.5 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 72
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 13 mEq/L
* Sodium: 129 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.9 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Multiple embolic strokes
* Thrombocytopenia (HIT positive)
* Anemia
* Metabolic acidosis
* Renal failure (acute on chronic insufficiency)
* Hyponatremia
* Hyperglycemia
* Fever of unknown origin (FUO)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation
* Monitor SaO2
* Continue current level of support
* Enroll in research study (receiving either steroid vs placebo)
* Tolerate net weaning of vasopressors
* Monitor BP and maintain MAP >60 mmHg
* Continue antimicrobials
* Monitor Plts
* D/C heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be contributing to HIT
* Consider anticoagulation
* Check peripheral blood smear
* Repeat lactate level
* Monitor UO, BUN, and creatinine
* Provide NS constant infusion and monitor serial Na
* Change meds to NS
* Maintain glucose <150
* Continue TF

The patient's family has been updated on the patient's condition and has agreed to proceed with extubation, despite the patient's somnulant mental status, in the hope that the patient will be comfortable and may be able to protect their airway. If the patient's clinical status declines following extubation, no plans for reintubation or resuscitation will be made, and the focus of care will shift to comfort.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Sepsis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anemia
* Metabolic acidosis
* Renal failure
* Hyponatremia
* Hyperglycemia
* Fever of unknown origin
* Multiple embolic strokes
* CNS vasculitis
* Seizures
* Post-ictal state

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to ensure that any potential complications are identified and addressed promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, embolic hemorrhagic strokes, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and has been experiencing multiple complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, and is stable on current settings.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is attributed in part to sepsis, and is being managed with vasopressors.
3. Neurological: The patient has had multiple CVA, with unclear etiology, and is being evaluated for possible CNS vasculitis.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, attributed to line placement during cardiac arrest, and is being treated with antimicrobials.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is attributed to HIT, and is being managed with discontinuation of heparin products and non-essential medications.
6. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which is attributed to progressive blood loss and is being evaluated for possible drug effect.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has developed metabolic acidosis, which is improving, and is being monitored for repeat lactate levels.
8. Renal failure: The patient has developed acute on chronic renal failure, which is being managed with intravascular repletion and monitoring of UO, BUN, and creatinine.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia, which is attributed to total body water overload, and is being managed with NS infusion and monitoring of serial Na levels.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient has developed hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin infusion and monitoring of glucose levels.
11. Nutritional support: The patient is receiving TF and is being monitored for nutritional adequacy.
12. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, which is being evaluated and managed with antibiotics.

The patient is critically ill and is being managed with a multidisciplinary team. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-started zosyn
   per ID for total 10 day course
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - need family meeting to readdress goals of care to CMO
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 37, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Likely HIT (given pos ab).
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
 holding off anticoag
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine/vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI. Extubated.
   - continue to monitor patient status
 give nebs and face mask as
   needed, no reintubation
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   # CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   # AOCRF
 Now with uptrending creatinine.
   - IVF PRN
   - monitor lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with pmh CAD, admitted [**3-6**] with fevers and hypotension,
   currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO with interval development
   of embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resuscitation.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness/Hemodynamic instability: PEA arrest on [**3-25**].  Patient
   was coded for roughly 20 minutes, undergoing chest compressions, NaHCO3
   and epinephrine.  Unclear etiology, though patient had prodrome during
   the day of new weakness and upgoing babinski, along with urinary
   retention, which then progressed to respiratory alkalosis of unknown
   cause. He was put on cooling protocol s/p Echo, EEG, CT of head
   (negative for acute bleed).  He had a femoral line with 1 positive BCx
 GPC - New RIJ was placed on [**3-25**].  He is still requiring pressor
   support, though able to be weaned off of neosynephrine overnight.  LP
   done.
   Mental status has improved and intermittently follows commands, it is
   waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   - vancomycin, zosyn both discontinued and then later re-started zosyn
   per ID for total 10 day course
   - wean pressors, now only on levophed
   - f/u bld, urine cx, LP cx
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u CSF cultures, HSV, VZV, EBV, TB
   - need family meeting to readdress goals of care to CMO
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 platelets today are 37, stepwise decline from 201
   on [**3-25**]^th. Likely HIT (given pos ab).
   - trend
   - re-involve heme
 holding off anticoag
   - PF4 ab POSITIVE; serotonin release antibody drawn and pending
   - DC heparin/famotidine/vanco
   - guaiac stool
   - BMT for BM biopsy results
   .
   # Respiratory status: oxygenating well, improving RSBI. Extubated.
   - continue to monitor patient status
 give nebs and face mask as
   needed, no reintubation
   - plan to diurese as tolerates
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation: notable
   for initial lactate of 5.1 likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor
   forward flow + increased afterload due to pressors and cooling
   - maintain pressors, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers of unknown origin - fever curve has trended down with T max of
   100.1. Per discussions with ID, would
   pursue gallium scan when stable. Rheum does not feel this ios
   consistent with vasculitis or lupus.  Endocrine team feels that he is
   adrenally sufficient and would not supplement with steroids at this
   point. Per hematology, bone marrow with hypercellular marrow and not
   myeloma.
   -- Continue to monitor fever curve
   -- f/u CSF results
   .
   # Hypoalbuminemia: renal disease, Poor PO. Likely contributes to
   intravascular volume and pressure problems
   .
   # embolic vs watershed stroke: continuing aspirin and pravastatin per
   neurology.
   -consider holter on discharge
   -appreciate and follow neuro rec
   -question if need rheum consult
   .
   # Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules - Per endo, feel that while he did not
   have a rise in cortisol by 8 points, still feel that he does not need
   steroids given his normal AM cortisol. Additionally, feel that he has
   sick euthyroid and would not give thyroid replacement at this time.
   -- Will need f/u TFTs in [**2-19**] weeks
   -- Will need endocrine follow up.
   .
   # CAD, native vessel - No chest pain.
   -- Continue ASA, statin
   -- Hold BB given hypotension
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - Statin as above
   .
   # AOCRF
 Now with uptrending creatinine.
   - IVF PRN
   - monitor lytes

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a past medical history of CAD, admitted with fevers and hypotension, and later developed embolic and hemorrhagic strokes. He is currently undergoing extensive workup for FUO (Fever of Unknown Origin).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was extubated and is currently on face mask with nebs as needed. His respiratory status is improving, and he is oxygenating well.
* Hemodynamic: The patient is still requiring pressor support, but was able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight. He has a platelet count of 37, which is a stepwise decline from 201 on the 25th.
* Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, which is likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload due to pressors and cooling.
* Fevers: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and he is being monitored for any further changes.
* Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely contributing to intravascular volume and pressure problems.
* Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient is being treated with aspirin and pravastatin for his stroke.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk for respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a fever of unknown origin and is at risk for developing a secondary infection.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is uptrending, and he is at risk for developing renal failure.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is not receiving adequate nutrition, and he is at risk for malnutrition.
7. Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient has hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, and he is at risk for further complications if not managed properly.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted with fevers and hypotension, and later developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, unresponsiveness, and pulseless. He was resuscitated and has been receiving extensive workup for fever of unknown origin (FUO).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been extubated to face mask. He is oxygenating well, and his respiratory status is improving.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient is still requiring pressor support, but has been able to be weaned off neosynephrine overnight.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 42, which is a stepwise decline from 201 on the 25th. The patient is likely experiencing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with appropriate respiratory compensation, likely due to cardiac dysfunction, poor forward flow, and increased afterload due to pressors and cooling.
* Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve has trended down, and he is currently on a 10-day course of vancomycin and zosyn. He will undergo a gallium scan when stable.
* Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, likely due to renal disease and poor oral intake.
* Embolic vs watershed stroke: The patient is continuing aspirin and pravastatin per neurology.
* Hypothyroidism/Adrenal nodules: The patient has hypothyroidism and adrenal nodules, but does not need steroids at this time.
* CAD, native vessel: The patient has CAD, native vessel, and is continuing ASA and statin.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia and is taking statin.
* AOCRF: The patient has AOCRF, with uptrending creatinine.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia and is on an insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to his respiratory status and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin and hypoalbuminemia make him at risk for sepsis.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's thrombocytopenia and HIT make him at risk for thrombosis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and pressor support make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal complications: The patient's AOCRF and uptrending creatinine make him at risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's embolic hemorrhagic strokes and watershed stroke make him at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cerebral edema.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive lines make him at risk for infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

I recommend close monitoring of the patient's condition and prompt treatment of any potential complications that arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He was found unresponsive, pulseless, and asystolic, and was resuscitated. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and his current condition is complicated by respiratory failure, hypotension, neurological impairment, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's respiratory status is stable on mechanical ventilation, but he requires continued support due to altered mental status and fluid balance issues. His neurological status is impaired, with evidence of multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and unclear etiology. He has a history of cardiac arrest and may have experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA). His bacteremia is attributed to line placement during code, and he is receiving antimicrobials.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is attributed to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and he is being monitored for platelet counts. His anemia is progressive, and he is being evaluated for possible causes. His metabolic acidosis is improving, but he has worsening renal failure and may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following arrest. His hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin infusion, and he is receiving nutritional support.

The patient's ICU care plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, monitoring of SaO2, and close monitoring of his fluid balance, blood pressure, and neurological status. He is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable on mechanical ventilation, but he may require continued support due to altered mental status and fluid balance issues.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient has impaired neurological status due to multiple cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) and unclear etiology, which may worsen or stabilize over time.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is attributed to line placement during code, and he is receiving antimicrobials. He may develop sepsis or organ dysfunction if the infection is not adequately treated.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is attributed to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and he is being monitored for platelet counts. He may develop bleeding complications if his platelet count drops further.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is progressive, and he is being evaluated for possible causes. He may develop fatigue, shortness of breath, or other symptoms if his anemia worsens.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, but he may develop further acidosis if his kidneys are not functioning properly.
7. Renal failure: The patient has worsening renal failure and may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following arrest. He may develop further kidney damage or require dialysis if his renal function does not improve.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin infusion, but he may develop further hyperglycemia if his insulin infusion is not adjusted properly.
9. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
10. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction increase his risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction, which can be life-threatening."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.  No
   neurological improvement.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Now off insulin infusion.  Maintain glucose <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Continue TF.
   FUO
 unclear etiology.  Evaluation in progress.  Currently without
   fever.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for fever of unknown origin (FUO) and developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, cardiac arrest, and sepsis. He was intubated and remains on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable on current settings and will continue mechanical ventilation to maintain gas exchange.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced asystole as an initial rhythm, and it is unclear whether he experienced PEA. He has completed the cooling protocol and will continue current support.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and will be monitored, with the goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
4. Neurological Status: The patient has evidence of multiple cerebral vasculitis, with unclear etiology. He is being evaluated for possible CNS processes, such as CNS vasculitis, and may have experienced seizures with post-ictal mental status changes.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia attributed to line placement during the code and will continue antimicrobials.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has HIT-positive thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored, and heparin products and non-essential medications that could contribute to HIT have been discontinued.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is progressive, and concern is raised for drug effect. A peripheral blood smear will be checked.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's peak lactate level was 5.1, which is now improving. Repeat lactate levels will be checked.
9. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and his creatinine level is worsening, possibly due to ATN following arrest. Intravascular repletion will be maintained, and urine output, BUN, and creatinine will be monitored.
10. Hyponatremia: The patient has total body water overload, and his serum and urine osmoles, urine electrolytes will be checked. Possible SIADH is being considered, and NS will be provided as an infusion, with serial Na monitoring.
11. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is being maintained below 150, and he is no longer receiving insulin infusion.
12. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving TF (Total Parenteral Nutrition) and will continue to receive it.
13. FUO: The patient's FUO remains unclear, and an evaluation is in progress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are potential complications.
2. Cardiac arrest: Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac rupture are potential complications.
3. Neurological status: Seizures, cerebral edema, and intracranial hemorrhage are potential complications.
4. Bacteremia: Sepsis, septic shock, and endocarditis are potential complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: HIT, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia are potential complications.
6. Anemia: Anemia, bleeding, and transfusion reactions are potential complications.
7. Metabolic acidosis: Lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, and hyperkalemia are potential complications.
8. Renal failure: Acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are potential complications.
9. Hyponatremia: SIADH, water intoxication, and hyponatremic encephalopathy are potential complications.
10. Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, and hypoglycemia are potential complications.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple comorbidities to prevent potential complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yom CAD, admitted [**3-6**] workup for FUO with interval development of
   embolic hemorrhagic strokes, found unresponsive, asystolic, and
   pulseless, s/p resusciation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.  Stable
   on current settings.  Continue mechanical ventilation, Monitor SaO2.
   Radiographic evidence for pleural effusions, bilateral.  Reasonable gas
   exchange.  Main obstacles to extubation currently altered mental status
   --> limited overall improvement; and fluid balance (net positive).
   s/p CARDIAC ARREST
 asystole as initial rhythm, may have experienced
   PEA.  s/p cooling protocol, now complete.  Continue current level of
   support.  Enrolled in research study (receiving either steroid vs
   placebo).
   HYPOTENSION -- attributable in part to sepsis.  Tolerating net weaning
   of vasopressors, monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   NEUROLOGICAL  -- evidence for multiple CVA, unclear etiology, embolic,
   bilateral.  Possible Continue evaluation as outlined.   Consider
   multiple embolic events, such as endocarditis.   MRI of spine clear of
   acute pathology, no evidence spinal cord lesion.  CSF analysis
   unrevealing, although studies remains pending.  Concern raised for
   possible CNS process such as CNS vasculitis.  Variablilty of mental
   status and exam suggest possible seizures with post ictal.  No
   neurological improvement.
   BACTEREMIA -- attributed to line placement in context of code.
   Continue antimicrobials.  Unable to perform repeat TEE.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 HIT positive.  Dramatic decline.  Monitor Plts.  D/C
   heparin products and all non-essential medications that could be
   contributing to HIT.  Unclear whether prior CNS emboli related to HIT
   consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for drug effect.  Check peripheral
   blood smear.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Peak lactate of 5.1, now improving.  Would
   repeat.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency.  Non-oliguric.
   Worsening creatinine, possible ATN following arrest.  Maintin
   intravascular repletion.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPONATREMIA -- total body water overloaded.  Would check serum/urine
   osmoles, urine electrolytes.  Possible SIADH.  Would provide NS
   constant infusion, monitor serial Na.  Change meds to NS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for a workup of fever of unknown origin (FUO). He developed embolic hemorrhagic strokes, became unresponsive, and had a cardiac arrest.
* The patient remains intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has pleural effusions and is receiving treatment for hypotension, neurological impairment, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and hyperglycemia.
* The patient's neurological status is unstable, with evidence of multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and unclear etiology. He has a history of cardiac arrest and may have experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA).
* The patient has a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) test and is being treated with anticoagulation.
* His metabolic acidosis is improving, and his renal function is worsening, with a peak lactate of 5.1.
* The patient has hyperglycemia and is being treated with insulin infusion. He has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following his cardiac arrest.
* The patient's nutritional status is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and his glycemic control is being monitored.
* The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and his family has been updated on his condition. The plan is to transition him to comfort care and discontinue vasopressor medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further neurological deterioration due to ongoing cerebrovascular disease or secondary to anticoagulation therapy.
* Worsening renal failure or ATN, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
* Continued hyperglycemia, which could lead to ketoacidosis or other complications.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia or other infections.
* Thrombotic complications due to HIT or other coagulopathies.
* Respiratory failure or pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or other complications due to anticoagulation therapy or other medications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and declining status, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent or manage these potential complications."
