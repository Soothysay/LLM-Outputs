   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS placement. Source seen on endoscopy
   at OSH was venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then
   opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were
   non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U
   PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with
   activation of massive transfusion protocol; has not had any
   transfusions since.  [**State **] tube removed during the morning.
   - Continue PPI, octreotide gtt
 will touch base with GI regarding
   duration, but likely 48 hr total before transitioning to [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
   discontinuing octreotide
   - Will need repeat US with Doppler to assess TIPS patency
 this should
   be done one week after TIPS (around [**2-16**])
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Respiratory status: Unclear if patient intubated for EtOH withdraw or
   for EGD.  Patient received paralysis for EGD and for med flight.
   Currently intubated.  Patient has had no problems with oxygenation.
   RSBI [**8-5**] this am.
   - Continue to wean off sedation
   - Continue PSV and attempt to wean off ventilation later today
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Appears to be net volume up on exam and CXR. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload with Cr unlikely where
   he chronically lives. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Trial IV lasix 10mg
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Positive blood cultures. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures. Patient
   does not look septic, other cultures negative. Given medical
   comorbidities, lines and recent hospitalization, will start treatment
   and continue to check cultures.
   - Start vancomycin
   - Check blood cultures both today and tomorrow
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue to use propofol for sedation; wean as tolerated
   - Needs valium prn CIWA once not sedated
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Monitor for signs of encephalopathy s/p weaning off sedation
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no anticoagulation
   # Access: RIJ [**Location (un) 342**], arterial line; will place additional PIV today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) secondary to esophageal varices and ethanol (EtOH) abuse. He has undergone endoscopy with banding twice and has had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% FiO2. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6, hemoglobin of 26.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 150 K/uL.

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, liver disease, and hepatitis C. He is also at risk for ethanol withdrawal and has required high doses of benzodiazepines in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying liver disease and ethanol abuse.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, particularly if he is not receiving adequate treatment for his liver disease.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk for ethanol withdrawal, which can lead to serious complications such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures and is at risk for infection, particularly if his lines and tubes are not properly cared for.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding, particularly if his liver disease is not well-managed.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. He is at risk for renal failure, particularly if his liver disease is not well-managed.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for cardiac complications, particularly if his liver disease is not well-managed.

Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's ethanol withdrawal symptoms.
4. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding risk and monitor for signs of further bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.

Note: The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of liver cirrhosis secondary to ethanol abuse and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the hospital with variceal bleeding and underwent endoscopy with banding twice. He was then transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. He has been intubated for ethanol withdrawal and endoscopy.
* Cardiovascular status: Tachycardic with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and normal blood pressure. He has a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place.
* Gastrointestinal status: He has had a TIPS placement and is receiving octreotide to control bleeding. He has ascites, and his abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and mildly distended.
* Hepatic status: He has liver cirrhosis secondary to ethanol abuse and hepatitis C. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and he is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal status: His creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, and he is at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Neurological status: He is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8.
* Infection status: He has a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci, and he is receiving ceftriaxone for prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to his liver cirrhosis and elevated LFTs, he is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
* Acute kidney injury: His elevated creatinine level and history of liver cirrhosis make him at risk for acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and need for dialysis.
* Respiratory failure: His respiratory status is uncertain, and he may be at risk for developing respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death.
* Sepsis: His positive blood culture and elevated white blood cell count make him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: His history of UGIB and TIPS placement make him at risk for developing further gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and death.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the plan of care should focus on:

* Monitoring his respiratory status closely and adjusting his ventilator settings as needed.
* Managing his gastrointestinal bleeding with octreotide and continuing to monitor his ascites.
* Managing his liver function with lactulose and continuing to monitor his LFTs.
* Monitoring his renal function closely and adjusting his fluid management as needed.
* Monitoring his neurological status closely and adjusting his sedation regimen as needed.
* Continuing to monitor his infection status and adjusting his antibiotic regimen as needed.
* Considering the patient for liver transplantation if his liver function does not improve."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of ethanol abuse, variceal bleeding, and subsequent alcohol withdrawal. The patient has undergone endoscopy with banding and has been treated with multiple transfusions, including 7 units of packed red blood cells and 4 fresh frozen plasma units.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient was extubated on [**2-10**] pm and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.52, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 29, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 92.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 123/67 mmHg, heart rate is 89 beats per minute (bpm), and cardiac silhouette is enlarged on the chest X-ray (CXR).
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and has undergone endoscopy with banding. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).
* Neurological: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is currently being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and the patient has received multiple transfusions, including 7 units of packed red blood cells and 4 fresh frozen plasma units.
* Infectious: The patient has a pending blood culture result showing gram-positive cocci, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the patient may require re-intubation.
* Sepsis: The patient's pending blood culture result showing gram-positive cocci and the patient's history of recent hospitalization and line placement increase the risk of sepsis.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's LFTs show elevated levels of ALT and AST, and the patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and the patient has received multiple transfusions, including 7 units of packed red blood cells and 4 fresh frozen plasma units.
* Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is currently being treated with thiamine and folate for ethanol withdrawal.

Based on the patient's current condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and be prepared for re-intubation if necessary.
* Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with vancomycin and monitor the patient's blood culture results.
* Continue to treat the patient's hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin and monitor the patient's LFTs.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and be prepared to initiate dialysis if necessary.
* Continue to treat the patient's ethanol withdrawal with thiamine and folate and monitor the patient's signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
* Continue to follow the patient's hematological and coagulation parameters and be prepared to initiate transfusions if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and be prepared to initiate treatment for electrolyte imbalances if necessary."

   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS. Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was
   venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE
   ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.
   Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP
   at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive
   transfusion protocol; has not had any transfusions since.  [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].
   - Change PPI to PO bid
   - Discontinue octreotide gtt
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Continue to check blood cultures qd [**Date range (1) 12635**]
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix. Still appears to be net
   volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Repeat lasix IV 20mg with repeat during pm prn
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Start valium prn CIWA
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Stable s/p extubation on [**2-10**] pm.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 50-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) following a variceal bleed and endoscopy with banding. He has a history of ethanol (EtOH) abuse, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 96%. He has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/67 mmHg, and a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a fluid balance of 2,212 mL with a net output of 1,985 mL and a urine output of 1,492 mL.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a large soft tissue injury on his right supraorbital ridge and is at risk for bleeding. He has been treated with lasix and has a net volume overload.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 16.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count is 172 x 10^9/L. His liver enzymes are elevated, and he has a positive blood culture for coag-positive bacteria.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. He may require further respiratory support.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and his central venous pressure is 10 mmHg. He may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a large soft tissue injury on his right supraorbital ridge and is at risk for further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-positive bacteria and may be at risk for sepsis.
* Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and hepatitis C, which may lead to liver failure.
* Renal failure: The patient has a net volume overload and may be at risk for acute kidney injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.
   .
   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy, Benzo withdraw, ICU
   delirium.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be
   net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   .
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn, will
   start sip to clears today
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no anticoagulation; PPI
   # Access: RIJ [**Location (un) 342**], PIV 18 gauge x2. Will attempt to remove RIJ this pm.
   # Communication: Patient & sister [**Doctor First Name 2049**]
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; possible to floor
   later this pm although will likely stay in ICU overnight.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   concern for benzo withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)

   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.

   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with variceal bleed, and subsequently underwent TIPS procedure. The patient's condition has been stable, with no signs of sepsis or organ failure. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by benzodiazepine withdrawal. Lactulose and rifaximin have been started to manage this condition.
2. Benzo Withdrawal: The patient has had a high benzo requirement in the past and is currently on CIWA scale. Ativan may be needed to manage withdrawal symptoms.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's urine output is decreased, and his creatinine level is trending downward, suggesting a possible volume overload. Lasix has been ordered to manage this condition.
4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms. Thiamine and folate have been started to manage this condition.
5. Hepatitis C and Cirrhosis: The patient likely has hepatitis C and cirrhosis secondary to ethanol abuse. This may lead to further complications, including encephalopathy and bleeding.
6. Blood Culture Contamination: The patient's blood culture is positive for coag+ organisms, which may be a contaminant. However, given the patient's medical comorbidities, treatment has been started, and cultures will be repeated.
7. Decreased Platelet Count: The patient's platelet count is 140, which is lower than normal. This may be related to his liver disease or blood loss.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. These levels will need to be closely monitored and managed.
9. Fever: The patient's temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), which is slightly elevated. This may be related to a urinary tract infection or another underlying condition.
10. Respiratory Support: The patient is not on respiratory support, but his oxygen saturation is 97%, which may indicate mild hypoxemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of events:
    (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was attempted
   to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous
   banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding
   x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a variceal bleed and subsequent TIPS placement. The patient's current status is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable with a stable Hct of 28.2-29.1%.
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy is required, and the patient's SpO2 is 97%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a tachycardic rhythm, but no murmurs, rubs, or gallops are present.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has altered mental status, likely related to hepatic encephalopathy and possible post-sedation component.
* Abdominal: The patient has mild ascites, soft, non-tender, and mildly distended abdomen.
* Renal: The patient has decreased urine output, and creatinine levels are trending downward.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for a Gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a potential infection. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the positive culture.
3. Volume overload: The patient has decreased urine output and appears to be net volume up on examination, which may indicate acute volume overload. Monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is essential to manage this condition.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which can worsen if not managed properly.
5. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis secondary to ethanol abuse and hepatitis C, which can lead to liver failure if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, respiratory function, and neurological status.
2. Manage the patient's hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin, and continue to monitor for signs of worsening encephalopathy.
3. Evaluate and treat the patient's positive blood culture, and continue to monitor for signs of infection.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolytes to manage volume overload, and consider adjusting diuretic therapy as necessary.
5. Manage the patient's EtOH withdrawal symptoms with ativan and other medications as necessary, and continue to monitor for signs of worsening withdrawal.
6. Continue to follow hepatology recommendations for the patient's liver disease, and monitor for signs of worsening liver function.
7. Consider listing the patient for liver transplant, although this may be unlikely given the patient's active ethanol use.

In summary, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a variceal bleed and subsequent TIPS placement. The patient's current status is stable, but potential complications include hepatic encephalopathy, infection, volume overload, EtOH withdrawal, and liver failure. A comprehensive plan is necessary to manage these complications and optimize the patient's outcomes."

   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart vancomycin (was discontinued yesterday, first started on [**2-10**]
   and restarted today)
   - Repeat BC today.
   # AMS
   Patient is stuporous today, without focality. Classic for delirium, has
   been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed fluctuating mental
   status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without asterixis and less likely
   due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory status and renal function are
   also good. Given alcohol history, need to check B12. Also initiate
   reversible causes of dementia workup.
   - B12, TSH and consider HIV testing
   - Continue lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to monitor
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix last night. Cr downtrending s/p
   lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely
   AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today.
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) following a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level.
* He has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is currently experiencing altered mental status (AMS) with a fluctuating mental status.
* He has a positive blood culture for a gram-positive cooccus, which may be a contaminant, but given his medical comorbidities and recent hospitalization, treatment has been initiated.
* He has a decreased urine output (UOP) that is resolving with good output to Lasix last night.
* He has elevated liver enzymes, primarily cholestatic, with concerns for partial obstruction of the biliary tract.
* He has a history of EtOH withdrawal and is currently being treated with benzodiazepines.
* He is likely positive for hepatitis C and has cirrhosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the positive blood culture and potential contamination.
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's history of EtOH abuse and cirrhosis.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's history of EtOH withdrawal and altered mental status.
* Renal failure due to the patient's history of EtOH withdrawal and decreased urine output.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of UGIB and TIPS procedure.
* Infection due to the patient's history of TIPS procedure and recent hospitalization.

To address these potential complications, the patient will be monitored closely for signs of sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infection. The patient will also be treated with antibiotics for the positive blood culture, and further diagnostic testing will be done to determine the cause of the patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased urine output."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.
   .
   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy, Benzo withdraw, ICU
   delirium.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be
   net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: UGIB (variceal).
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-11**]
   - Patient tolerated PO lactulose and sip/clears without regurgitation;
   decision was made not to place a NG tube
   - Bedside ultrasound did not show a collection of ascites for
   diagnostic paracentesis diagnosis.
   - Patient with bowel movement that appeared dark, but nursing concern
   regarding new bleed. Hct sent at 1600, which was stable at 28.2, 29.1
   at [**2169**].
   - Patient with good response to AM lasix with -1.5L at 1530; 1600
   electrolytes repleted.
   - Lactulose increased to 45ml as patient still with altered mental
   status in afternoon.
   - Patient's RIJ trauma line pulled.
   - Patient with continued altered mental status during late evening, and
   started on Ativan CIWA in the low likelihood this is related with
   withdrawal. He received one milligram during the late evening which
   seems to have calmed him down.
   - Patient with some erythema to red toe that needs to be looked at.
   [**2-12**]
   - I/O: -1.5 liters at (2200) after 40mg IV lasix
   - Hepatology: Ceftriaxone last day today, Continue as we are.
   - PO Ativan this AM, monitored on CIWA. Agitation, Mental Status seemed
   to improve sp ativan. Spoke with hepatology, plan for [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] if
   continues to be stable.
   - In early evening developed more agitation, redosed ativan, then 5mg
   Haldol IV. Became Hypertensive, Tachycardic, and agitated. Ativan 1 mg

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder (ELSD) and cirrhosis, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with variceal bleeding (UGIB) after undergoing endoscopy and banding at another hospital. He has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and has been receiving treatment for his bleeding.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit (HCT) level
* Mentally altered, with possible encephalopathy due to hepatic insufficiency and benzodiazepine withdrawal
* Tachycardic with a regular rhythm
* Hypertensive with a blood pressure of 161/91 mmHg
* Has erythema on his left great toe
* Has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Has been treated with antibiotics for possible sepsis, with a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci (possibly Enterococcus species)
* Has been receiving IV lasix for fluid overload and is being monitored for decreased urine output

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the varices
* Development of sepsis or bacteremia due to the positive blood culture
* Worsening of hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure
* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance due to IV lasix therapy
* Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure due to fluid overload
* Infection or abscess formation at the site of the TIPS procedure
* Hepatic failure or liver transplantation
* Cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension or tachycardia, due to fluid overload or sepsis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results
* Maintenance of his fluid and electrolyte balance
* Treatment of his bleeding and possible sepsis
* Management of his hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure
* Monitoring for signs of alcohol withdrawal and possible treatment with benzodiazepines
* Follow-up with the patient's hepatology team to adjust his treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary edema, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, upper, respiratory failure, acute, and airway, inability to protect. The patient has been receiving treatment for these conditions, including lasix, lactulose, and antibiotics.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has had a bowel movement that appeared dark, but nursing concern regarding new bleed. The patient's hemoglobin level has been stable, and the patient has not shown any signs of bleeding. The patient's lactulose has been increased to 45ml due to continued altered mental status.

The patient has also developed some erythema to the red toe that needs to be looked at. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, and blood pressure of 161/91 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.6, hemoglobin level of 29.7, and platelet count of 181. The patient's blood cultures have been negative for growth.

The patient's imaging studies have been normal, and the patient's microbiology results have shown a possible enterococcus species on blood culture.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed could worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress to chronic respiratory failure or require mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient's possible enterococcus species on blood culture could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status could worsen, leading to delirium or coma.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's pulmonary edema could worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend that the patient continue to receive treatment for their underlying conditions, including lasix, lactulose, and antibiotics. The patient's lactulose should be continued at 45ml to help manage their altered mental status. The patient's erythema to the red toe should be looked at and treated accordingly.

The patient's laboratory results should be closely monitored to ensure that their condition is not worsening. The patient's imaging studies should be repeated to rule out any new complications. The patient's microbiology results should be closely monitored to ensure that the patient does not develop sepsis or septic shock.

The patient's airway, inability to protect should be closely monitored to ensure that the patient does not develop aspiration pneumonia. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control should be closely monitored to ensure that the patient is receiving adequate nutrition and that their blood glucose levels are within a normal range.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment to ensure that they do not develop any further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Obtain B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   - Send A1c
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn; low
   sodium regular diet, soft dysphagia
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no anticoagulation; PPI
   # Access: PIV 18 gauge x2
   # Communication: Patient & sister [**Doctor First Name 2049**]
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; possible to floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Obtain B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for management of refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and alcohol withdrawal. The patient has undergone endoscopy with banding, placement of a [**State **] tube, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

Current Status:

* The patient remains stuporous with dense delirium, oriented to self only, and requires restraints.
* He is hemodynamically stable, with a positive fluid balance, and has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 4 fresh frozen plasma (FPP) units at the previous hospital.
* The patient has had a modest drop in gradient after the TIPS procedure and has not required transfusions since.
* He has elevated liver enzymes, primarily cholestatic, and concerns for partial obstruction of the biliary tract.
* The patient has decreased urine output, which is resolving with good output to Lasix, and has a net volume up on examination.
* He has been treated with substantial amounts of benzodiazepine for EtOH withdrawal and has been started on PO Ativan and CIWA scale.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes, primarily cholestatic, and concerns for partial obstruction of the biliary tract increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture, and the diagnosis of a contaminant is uncertain. Given the patient's medical comorbidities, lines, and recent hospitalization, the risk of infection is high.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, and the decreased urine output may indicate fluid overload. Monitoring of net fluid balance and administration of Lasix to ensure a negative balance is necessary.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of renal dysfunction.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB, and the risk of recurrent bleeding is high.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and concerns for partial obstruction of the biliary tract increase the risk of liver failure.
7. Seizures: The patient's history of EtOH withdrawal and benzodiazepine treatment increase the risk of seizures.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes, renal function, and fluid balance.
* Restart and continue vancomycin for the treatment of the positive blood culture.
* Obtain a repeat blood culture and continue to monitor for signs of infection.
* Continue to trend liver enzymes and follow GGT, AFP, and direct bilirubin levels.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and suspected acute on chronic liver disease (ACLD). He has undergone endoscopy, banding, and placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing encephalopathy, ascites, and worsening liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is a significant concern, as it can lead to further deterioration in his condition, including increased risk of seizures, coma, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate the presence of sepsis. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there is concern for partial obstruction of the biliary tract. This could lead to further liver damage and failure.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, which may indicate fluid overload. This could lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory and cardiac failure.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney injury. This could lead to further kidney damage and increased risk of chronic kidney disease.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which may lead to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased immune function.
7. Infection: The patient's blood culture is positive, which may indicate the presence of an infection. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's UGIB is ongoing, which may lead to further bleeding, anemia, and decreased quality of life.
9. Hepatitis C: The patient is HCV-positive, which may lead to further liver damage and increased risk of liver failure.
10. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, which may lead to ethanol withdrawal syndrome, including seizures, hallucinations, and increased risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Consider further imaging studies, such as ultrasound or CT scan, to evaluate the patient's liver and biliary tract.
3. Continue to manage the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels.
4. Consider further antibiotics and antifungals to treat the patient's positive blood culture.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
6. Consider further nutritional support, including enteral or parenteral nutrition, to promote the patient's recovery.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's HCV infection.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's UGIB and consider further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
10. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's ethanol withdrawal syndrome."

   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - FU B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Daily HCt, Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets >
   70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   # Positive blood culture x1 set.
   Enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures. Will
   continue per hepatology recommendations.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.  Abd US with functioning TIPS,
   Gallbladder wall edema without obstruction. AFP not elevated.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes: AST/ALT downtrending  while  AP,
   T.bili; uptrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   - Obtain ultrasound as per above
   # EtOH abuse: As above.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs as above
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, who was admitted to the hospital with variceal bleed and subsequently underwent TIPS placement. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic status: Stable, with a blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg and a heart rate of 88 beats per minute.
* Respiratory status: Stable, with a respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%.
* Neurological status: Encephalopathic, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12, and a diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Blood cultures: Positive for Enterococcus, sensitive to vancomycin.
	+ Liver enzymes: Elevated, with a LDH level of 391 IU/L and an AST/ALT ratio of 1.6.
	+ Coagulation studies: International normalized ratio (INR) of 1.8, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 37.4 seconds.
	+ Renal function: Normal, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies:
	+ TIPS: Patent, with a patent TIPS and a normal portal venous vasculature.
	+ Ultrasound: Gallbladder wall edema and distention without cholelithiasis.
* Other findings:
	+ Ascites: Present, with a diagnosis of cirrhosis and ascites.
	+ Hepatic encephalopathy: Present, with a diagnosis of encephalopathy and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
	+ Malnutrition: Present, with a diagnosis of malnutrition and a need for nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: Given the positive blood culture and the patient's history of ethanol abuse, there is a risk of sepsis.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there is a risk of hepatic failure.
* Encephalopathy: The patient's neurological status is encephalopathic, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of renal failure.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and a history of ethanol abuse, which increases the risk of infection.
* Malnutrition: The patient has a diagnosis of malnutrition, and there is a risk of further malnutrition and its complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing vancomycin for the treatment of Enterococcus.
* Restarting and continuing lactulose for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
* Continuing rifaximin for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
* Continuing PPI for the treatment of stress ulcer disease.
* Obtaining a repeat blood culture and a chest X-ray.
* Trending liver enzymes and coagulation studies.
* Following up with hepatology recommendations.
* Continuing to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjusting treatment as needed."

   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - FU B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing

   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a variceal bleed, treated with TIPS and AMS. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, ascites, and is currently experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Stupor and altered mental status
* Tachycardia and regular rhythm
* Coarse breath sounds bilaterally
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with mild distension
* Bilateral edema and left great toe with minimal erythema
* Ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract
* Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels
* Positive blood culture for Enterococcus, sensitive to vancomycin

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and stupor may be a sign of worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which can progress to coma and death if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture for Enterococcus and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of infection, particularly if the line becomes infected.
3. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract may continue to pose a risk of hemorrhage and shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload, particularly in the setting of cirrhosis and ascites.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's serum electrolyte levels are not specified, but the presence of ascites and cirrhosis may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
6. Renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine level is not specified, but the presence of cirrhosis and ascites may increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in the setting of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites may increase the risk of hepatic failure, particularly if the patient's liver function continues to deteriorate.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and neurological function closely.
2. Manage the patient's bleeding with continued transfusions and endoscopic banding.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infection with vancomycin and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely, and adjust fluids and electrolytes as necessary.
5. Consider consulting with a nephrologist if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
6. Continue to follow up with the patient's primary care physician and hepatologist to ensure that the patient's liver function is being monitored and managed properly.
7. Consider listing the patient for liver transplantation if the patient's liver function continues to deteriorate and the patient is not a candidate for medical management."
