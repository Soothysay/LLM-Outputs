   Chief Complaint: 69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with
   nephrotic syndrome and renal failure, transferred to ICU for
   hypotension in setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   24 Hour Events:
 PICC LINE - START [**2168-1-11**] 04:00 PM
 EKG - At [**2168-1-12**] 02:16 AM
   - Renal:  Mild Cr bump likely secondary to transient hypotension; no
   need for HD at this time.  Can use lasix 100mg IV x1 to see if responds
   to lasix if need to increase UOP.
   - Onc:  no chemo for now, consider head MRI for AMS, patient is

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome
   and renal failure, transferred to ICU for hypotension in setting of
   pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   # Transverse colitis:  Likely ischemic colitis in setting of
   hypotension though other etiologies also on differential, including
   infectious colitis and c. diff.  Stool studies and c. diff toxin
   negative.  Lactate improving and patient no longer having BRBPR or
   abdominal pain.
   - continue NPO for today per surgery reccs
   - low threshold for OR if clinically decompensates per surgery
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, though dosing vancomycin by
   level
   - gentle IVF given volume overload in setting of renal failure and
   decreased urine output
   - will follow Hct and lactate q8h
   - will continue to send c. diff toxin assay when patient stools
   - f/u GI and surgery reccs
   #. Hypotension:  Hemodynamic instability was initial reason for [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   admission and patient continues to become hypotensive to SBP of 70s and
   MAP of 40s while sleeping.  Blood pressure responds promptly to waking
   patient/agitation but is not fluid responsive.  Differential includes
   amyloid neuropathy, fluid shifting in setting of colitis, sepsis given
   steroid use, and hypocortisolism given amyloid and elevated TSH.
   - transfuse for Hct<30
   - gentle IVF with sodium bicarb
   - follow-up a.m. cortisol

   #.Acute Renal Failure: secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic
   syndrome. Albumin 1.6. Also with bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria.  Renal
   service is following, they recommend using lasix for peripheral edema,
   and administering IVF along with Lasix in setting of chemotherpay
   administration to minimize hemorrhagic cystitis.  Renal suggests trial
   of lasix 100 mg IV x 1 if concern for decreased UOP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, pneumonia, possible colitis, and bloody stool. The patient had a PICC line inserted and received two units of blood transfusion. He is receiving antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/65 mmHg, heart rate of 112 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show mild creatinine bump, anemia, and transaminitis. The patient is not receiving chemotherapy due to colitis and is being monitored for signs of worsening abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic colitis: The patient's symptoms of bloody stool, abdominal pain, and hypotension suggest the possibility of ischemic colitis. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised due to amyloidosis, and the use of IVF and lasix may further exacerbate kidney injury.
4. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state, and the use of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance.
5. Hemorrhagic cystitis: The patient is receiving chemotherapy, which may cause hemorrhagic cystitis, a potentially life-threatening complication.
6. Hypocortisolism: The patient's elevated TSH and low cortisol levels suggest the possibility of hypocortisolism, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency and death if not promptly treated.
7. Amyloid neuropathy: The patient's symptoms of hypotension and abdominal pain may be indicative of amyloid neuropathy, which can lead to autonomic dysfunction and organ failure.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be caused by velcade toxicity, chronic hepatitis B, or amyloid infiltration, which can lead to liver failure and death if not promptly treated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to detect any changes in his condition.
2. Administer antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral medications as prescribed to prevent infections.
3. Manage the patient's fluid status by monitoring his blood pressure and urine output.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as a surgical intensive care unit, if his condition worsens.
5. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's renal function.
6. Consider consulting with an oncologist to optimize the patient's chemotherapy regimen.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to optimize the patient's management of colitis.
8. Consider monitoring the patient's cortisol levels and administering corticosteroids if necessary to prevent adrenal insufficiency."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR. The patient received a total of 2.5 L of fluids overnight, and his blood pressure initially responded to boluses but then fell to systolic 80's shortly after. The potential causes of hypotension include septic shock from pneumonia, gut flora translocation from colitis, or hypovolemia from BRBPR.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Multiple myeloma: Currently receiving cytoxan, holding velcade secondary to transaminitis.
* Amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure: Renal service is following, and they recommend using lasix for peripheral edema and administering IVF along with Lasix in setting of chemotherapy administration to minimize hemorrhagic cystitis.
* Transaminitis: Occurred in setting of velcade administration during previous hospitalization, may be due to velcade toxicity, chronic hep B, or amyloid infiltration.
* Pneumonia: Detected on chest CT, with possible colitis.
* Ischemic colitis: Detected on abdominal CT, with possible causes including infectious, or ischemic.
* BRBPR: Patient has a history of bleeding, with possible causes including colitis, diverticulosis, or hemorrhoids.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Septic shock from pneumonia
* Gut flora translocation from colitis
* Hypovolemia from BRBPR
* Ischemic colitis
* Hemorrhagic cystitis
* Transaminitis
* Amyloidosis progression
* Renal failure
* Pneumonia progression
* Colitis progression
* BRBPR progression"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple myeloma, and renal failure due to amyloidosis. He was admitted to the hospital with fevers, left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate, cough, and hypotension, which was attributed to a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from transverse colitis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple potential medical complications. The following are some of the key issues:

1. Ischemic colitis: The patient has a high risk of developing further complications due to the presence of ischemic colitis, which may lead to perforation, abscess formation, or sepsis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk of developing further kidney damage or failure.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to medication-induced liver damage, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), amyloidosis, or chronic hepatitis B.
4. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which is a malignant plasma cell disorder. He is at risk of developing further complications, such as bone lesions, anemia, and infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemic shock from GI bleeding, septic shock from colitis, or autonomic instability.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient has a history of COPD and may be at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of multiple myeloma and immunosuppressive therapy.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and may be at risk of developing malnutrition, which can further compromise his immune function and overall health.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. The plan includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics and antifungal therapy to treat possible infections.
2. Managing the patient's fluid status to prevent hypovolemic shock and maintain renal function.
3. Monitoring the patient's liver enzymes to assess for potential liver damage.
4. Adjusting his medication regimen to minimize the risk of further complications.
5. Providing nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and promote recovery.
6. Continuously monitoring the patient's respiratory and cardiac status to prevent further complications.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple myeloma, and renal failure due to amyloidosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, fever, and a gastrointestinal bleed due to transverse colitis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing hypotension, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He is receiving vasopressors and has been transfused with packed red blood cells. His laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly in the lungs, kidneys, and liver.
2. Further gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to transverse colitis.
3. Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
4. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications, such as hypotension, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological complications, including seizures, encephalopathy, or coma.
7. Infection with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) or other pathogens.
8. Development of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.
9. Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to gastrointestinal dysfunction.
10. Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, due to altered glucose metabolism.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuation of antibiotics, addition of Flagyl for C. diff, and management of hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute renal failure. Close monitoring of the patient's condition and laboratory results is essential to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple myeloma, and renal failure due to amyloidosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension in the setting of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from transverse colitis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing concerns for:

1. Intermittent hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and the etiology is unclear. It is possible that the hypotension is due to hypovolemic shock from the GI bleed, septic shock from the colitis, or possibly pneumococcal pneumonia (PNA) given the recent change in antibiotics. Autonomic instability is also a possibility.
2. Transverse/ischemic colitis: The patient has a history of colitis, and the current episode may be due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) or another infectious etiology. The patient's lactate levels are downtrending, but the ischemia is ongoing.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of amyloidosis, which is causing nephrotic syndrome. The patient is at risk for hemorrhagic cystitis due to the use of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to medication-induced toxicity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), amyloidosis, or chronic hepatitis B.
5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, and the current treatment plan includes holding Cytoxan today and following up with oncology recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing colitis and potential infectious etiology.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a history of COPD and may be at risk for ARDS due to the ongoing inflammation and potential respiratory failure.
3. Hemorrhagic Cystitis: The patient is at risk for hemorrhagic cystitis due to the use of Cytoxan.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a history of amyloidosis, which is causing nephrotic syndrome, and is at risk for developing CKD.
5. Hepatic Failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and may be at risk for hepatic failure due to the ongoing inflammation and potential liver damage.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continue vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics.
2. Flagyl for C. diff.
3. Hct q8h and active type and screen; PRBC prn.
4. Cortisol level.
5. IV Flagyl for transverse/ischemic colitis.
6. NPO; meds okay.
7. GI involved.
8. F/U repeat C. diff.
9. Bicarbonate 650mg PO TID for acute renal failure.
10. Renal following; trying to avoid HD.
11. Lasix prn.
12. Judicious IVF to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis on Cytoxan.
13. Continue lamivudine for transaminitis.
14. Hold Cytoxan today for multiple myeloma.
15. Follow-up oncology recommendations.

The patient's current disposition is ICU, and the total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple myeloma, and renal failure due to amyloidosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and a GI bleed secondary to transverse colitis. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and has undergone a PICC line insertion. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. His laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. He has a history of acute renal failure, and his creatinine level is 4.3 mg/dL. He is also experiencing transaminitis, and his liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's recent change in antibiotics and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Ischemic colitis: The patient's history of transverse colitis and the presence of lactate downtrending suggest the possibility of ischemic colitis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is 4.3 mg/dL, which is elevated. This may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of ALT and AST, which may indicate transaminitis.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and the presence of infiltrates on his chest x-ray increase the risk of pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of multiple myeloma and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of multiple myeloma and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of stress ulcer.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 112/59 mmHg, which is below normal. This may indicate hypotension.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory failure.
10. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of multiple myeloma and the presence of a PICC line increase the risk of cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome
   and renal failure, transferred to ICU for hypotension in setting of
   pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   # Transverse colitis:  Likely ischemic colitis in setting of
   hypotension though other etiologies also on differential, including
   infectious colitis and c. diff.  Stool studies and c. diff toxin
   negative.  Lactate improving and patient no longer having BRBPR or
   abdominal pain.
   - trial of clear diet today
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, though dosing vancomycin by
   level
   - antibiotics x 10-14 days per surgery
   - gentle IVF given volume overload in setting of renal failure and
   decreased urine output
   - will follow Hct and lactate q12h
   - will continue to send c. diff toxin assay when patient stools
   - surgery signing off, have lower suspicion for ischemic colitis but
   [**Male First Name (un) **]
t think surgical intervention indicated at this time anyway
   #. Hypotension:  Hemodynamic instability was initial reason for [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   admission and patient continued to become hypotensive to SBP of 70s and
   MAP of 40s while sleeping, though this resolved overnight on [**1-12**].
   Blood pressure responds promptly to waking patient/agitation but is not
   fluid responsive.  Differential includes amyloid neuropathy, fluid
   shifting in setting of colitis, and sepsis given steroid use.  Cortisol
   level normal in a.m. of [**1-12**] so no concern for hydrocortisolism.
   - transfuse for Hct<30
   - gentle IVF with sodium bicarb
   - consider neuro consult to r/o amyloid neuropathy
   - attempt agitation if hypotensive
   #.Acute Renal Failure: secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic
   syndrome. Albumin 1.6. Also with bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria.  Renal
   service is following, they recommend using lasix for peripheral edema,
   and administering IVF along with Lasix in setting of chemotherpay
   administration to minimize hemorrhagic cystitis.  Renal suggests trial
   of lasix 100 mg IV x 1 if concern for decreased UOP.
   -Bicarbonate po per renal
   - f/u renal reccs
   #.Transaminitis: occurred in setting of velcade administration during
   previous hospitalization in early [**Month (only) **]. Causes may include velcade
   toxicity, chronic hep B, or amyloid infiltration.
   -lamivudine
   #.Multiple Myeloma: Currently not receiving cytoxan in setting of
   colitis.  Holding velcade secondary to transaminitis.
   - f/u onc reccs
   #. Delirium/mood instability:  Patient has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mood and
   mental status.  [**Month (only) 8**] represent depression vs disorientation in setting
   of hospitalization vs primary neurological process.
   - consider head MRI when discharged back to BMT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure, who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, pneumonia, possible colitis, and blood in stool (BRBPR). He has been experiencing worsening abdominal pain, lactate of 1.4, and soft belly. He also mentioned suicidal thoughts due to pain, but this was unclear due to a language barrier. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg. His respiratory support is minimal, and he is not on oxygen therapy.

Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, lactate of 1.4, and soft belly, are consistent with ischemic colitis. However, other etiologies, including infectious colitis and C. diff, are also possible.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is not fluid-responsive, and his differential diagnosis includes amyloid neuropathy, fluid shifting in the setting of colitis, and sepsis given steroid use.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired due to amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to velcade toxicity, chronic hepatitis B, or amyloid infiltration.
5. Delirium/Mood Instability: The patient has waxing and waning mood and mental status, which may be due to depression, disorientation, or primary neurological process.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of steroid use and his current symptoms, sepsis is a potential complication.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may increase his risk for cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ischemic colitis and possible C. diff infection may increase his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if he does not receive proper treatment and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y.o. man w/ multiple myeloma, amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome
   and renal failure, transferred to ICU for hypotension in setting of
   pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
   # Transverse colitis:  Likely ischemic colitis in setting of
   hypotension though other etiologies also on differential, including
   infectious colitis and c. diff.  Stool studies and c. diff toxin
   negative.  Lactate improving and patient no longer having BRBPR or
   abdominal pain.
   - continue NPO for today per surgery reccs
   - low threshold for OR if clinically decompensates per surgery
   - continue flagyl, cefepime, vancomycin, though dosing vancomycin by
   level
   - gentle IVF given volume overload in setting of renal failure and
   decreased urine output
   - will follow Hct and lactate q8h
   - will continue to send c. diff toxin assay when patient stools
   - f/u GI and surgery reccs
   #. Hypotension:  Hemodynamic instability was initial reason for [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   admission and patient continues to become hypotensive to SBP of 70s and
   MAP of 40s while sleeping.  Blood pressure responds promptly to waking
   patient/agitation but is not fluid responsive.  Differential includes
   amyloid neuropathy, fluid shifting in setting of colitis, sepsis given
   steroid use, and hypocortisolism given amyloid and elevated TSH.
   - transfuse for Hct<30
   - gentle IVF with sodium bicarb
   - follow-up a.m. cortisol
   - attempt agitation if hypotensive
   #.Acute Renal Failure: secondary to amyloidosis causing nephrotic
   syndrome. Albumin 1.6. Also with bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria.  Renal
   service is following, they recommend using lasix for peripheral edema,
   and administering IVF along with Lasix in setting of chemotherpay
   administration to minimize hemorrhagic cystitis.  Renal suggests trial
   of lasix 100 mg IV x 1 if concern for decreased UOP.
   -Bicarbonate po per renal
   - f/u renal reccs
   #.Transaminitis: occurred in setting of velcade administration during
   previous hospitalization in early [**Month (only) **]. Causes may include velcade
   toxicity, chronic hep B, or amyloid infiltration.
   -lamivudine
   #.Multiple Myeloma: Currently not receiving cytoxan in setting of
   colitis.  Holding velcade secondary to transaminitis.
   - f/u onc reccs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR. The patient has a complex medical history and is currently experiencing several complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 117 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 51 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 31 IU/L. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 18 mL/min.

The patient's medical history is significant for multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and nephrotic syndrome, which have led to renal failure and hypotension. The patient is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Ischemic colitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia are consistent with ischemic colitis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels are consistent with sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's compromised renal function and elevated creatinine levels are consistent with acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated LFTs and decreased albumin levels are consistent with liver dysfunction.
5. Hypocortisolism: The patient's elevated TSH levels and decreased cortisol levels are consistent with hypocortisolism.
6. Amyloid neuropathy: The patient's symptoms of weakness, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet are consistent with amyloid neuropathy.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is consistent with sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% are consistent with respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, possible colitis, and BRBPR.
2. Fluid management: The patient is receiving gentle IV fluids to manage volume overload and hypotension.
3. Pain management: The patient is receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.
4. Nutritional support: The patient is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube.
5. Monitoring: The patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status will be closely monitored to adjust treatment as necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and optimize outcomes."
