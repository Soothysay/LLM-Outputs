You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with severe acute mountain sickness (AMS) and impaired skin integrity. They have been receiving lactulose through both parenteral and oral routes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 78/41 to 113/97 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 97%.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and 20-gauge peripheral IV line. They have also received antibiotics, including caspofungin and meropenem. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is severely impaired, increasing the risk of further deterioration in their neurological status.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. This may worsen their overall condition and increase the risk of fluid overload.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to their compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and they may be at risk of developing hypotensive shock.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and potential sepsis.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they may be at risk of developing respiratory complications due to their underlying condition and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's liver function is impaired, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or deterioration in their condition.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy, dialysis, and antibiotics, as necessary.
3. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to optimize the patient's liver function and manage their underlying condition.
4. Implement measures to prevent skin breakdown and promote wound healing.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust their fluid management accordingly to prevent fluid overload.
6. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist to optimize the patient's respiratory care and prevent respiratory complications.
7. Consider implementing stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and awaiting liver/kidney transplant, has been admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD. She has undergone paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed and is currently somnolent, responding to voice but with no focal deficit. The patient has been started on lactulose and has been given antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 78/41 mmHg and a heart rate of 85 bpm. She has a respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and an SpO2 of 97%. Her physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the bases, soft abdomen with massive distension, and no signs of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's ongoing liver failure and renal failure may worsen her encephalopathy, leading to further cognitive decline and increased risk of seizures.
2. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient's history of paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed and her ongoing ascites may lead to further bleeding and potential complications such as sepsis and organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute and her need for oxygen support may indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which could worsen her overall condition.
4. Infection: The patient's ongoing antibiotics and the presence of bilateral crackles at the bases may indicate a potential infection, which could worsen her condition and lead to further complications.
5. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, may worsen her encephalopathy and increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure may worsen her condition and lead to further complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's massive ascites and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further complications such as sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue lactulose therapy to manage the patient's encephalopathy.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and electrolyte levels closely to prevent further complications.
3. Continue antibiotics to manage potential infections.
4. Consider IR-guided paracentesis to manage the patient's ascites and potential intraabdominal bleeding.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further respiratory support if necessary.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's electrolyte levels to prevent further complications.
7. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with ongoing dialysis and close monitoring of her electrolyte levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated to
   day in the setting of unresponsiveness
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin
   - will tolerate low MAPs
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - pressors less likely to help with her presumed high cardiac output
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 new leukocytosis today, already on broad spectrum
   abx.  Unclear etiology
   - pan culture
   - IR guided diagnostic paracentesis today (will give FFP pre tap)
   - Id following
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and awaiting liver and kidney transplant. She was admitted to the ICU from the operating room with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring hemodialysis. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has developed leukocytosis. She is currently somnolent, responds to simple commands, and has severe AMS. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 78/41 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute. She has a nasogastric tube, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is likely chronically hypotensive due to her liver disease. Her cardiac output is high, making it less likely that pressors will help.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has developed leukocytosis, and it is unclear what is causing it. She is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a pan culture has been sent. A diagnostic paracentesis is planned, and she will be given fresh frozen plasma pre-procedure.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has likely developed hepatorenal syndrome, which is worsening her renal function. She is oliguric and has been on intermittent hemodialysis.
4. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient had an intraabdominal bleed after paracentesis, and her hemoglobin is stable. She will need further IR-guided paracentesis and may require transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on oxygen therapy. She may require further respiratory support.
6. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on home tegretol. She may require further anticonvulsant therapy.
7. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety and is currently holding psychotropic medications due to delirium.
8. Hypoxia: The patient has developed hypoxia, which may be related to aspiration while unresponsive. She will require further oxygen therapy and may require intubation.
9. Infection: The patient has developed leukocytosis and may have an underlying infection. She will require further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions."

   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose

   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection

   # Hepatorenal syndrome/Abdominal Compartment Syndrome - likely
   triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with only 25gm albumin. Patient is
   currently oliguric.  Renal has been following.  Has been getting
   intermittent HD.  UO has basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   Previously, patient was listed for a kidney transplant. Renal function
   is worse in the setting of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. On [**3-24**], had
   tap to reduce pressures
   - since blood pressures unstable, renal will do CVVH.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise.

**Summary of Progress:**

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and resolved respiratory failure. She was initially admitted with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring dialysis. She has undergone paracentesis complicated by intra-abdominal bleed and is awaiting liver and kidney transplantation.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) with massive ascites and abdominal distension
* Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) with oliguria and worsening renal function
* Leukocytosis with a worsening trend
* Unresponsiveness likely due to hepatic encephalopathy
* Hoarse voice possibly due to vocal trauma
* History of DM2, seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS)**: The patient's massive ascites and abdominal distension may worsen, leading to further compromise of her respiratory and circulatory function.
2. **Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS)**: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, further complicating her liver disease.
3. **Infection**: The patient's leukocytosis and worsening trend may indicate a developing infection, which could worsen her condition and compromise her immune function.
4. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: The patient's unresponsiveness may worsen, leading to further cognitive decline and potential seizures.
5. **Respiratory Failure**: The patient's abdominal compartment syndrome may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure.
6. **Cardiovascular Complications**: The patient's chronic hypotension and potential cardiac output issues may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as hypotensive shock or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications**: The patient's massive ascites and abdominal distension may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. **Seizure Disorder**: The patient's history of seizure disorder may worsen, leading to further seizures and potential neurological complications.

**Plan:**

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue monitoring the patient's hemodynamics, electrolytes, and renal function.
* Continue antibiotic therapy for potential infections.
* Continue lactulose therapy to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
* Continue albumin therapy to manage abdominal compartment syndrome.
* Consider CVVH for further renal support.
* Consider ENT consultation for the patient's hoarse voice.
* Continue to follow up with the liver team regarding the patient's transplant candidacy.
* Continue to monitor the patient's seizure disorder and adjust medication as necessary.
* Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's code status and potential for comfort measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - on levophed
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 worsening, on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin (since [**3-19**]).
   Yeast identified in urine, sputum and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology
   is L abdominal eschar could be infected. Patient had diagnostic and
   therapeutic tap on [**3-24**] where 4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after
   correcting for RBCs, however gram stain negative.
   - ID following, sent b-glucan, galactomannin on [**3-25**]

   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks

   # Hepatorenal syndrome/Abdominal Compartment Syndrome - likely
   triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with only 25gm albumin. Patient is
   currently oliguric.  Renal has been following.  Has been getting
   intermittent HD.  UO has basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   Previously, patient was listed for a kidney transplant. Renal function
   is worse in the setting of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. On [**3-24**], had
   tap to reduce pressures
   - since blood pressures unstable, renal will do CVVH.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and resolved respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, requiring dialysis. She has undergone paracentesis with SBP on vancomycin and caspofungin. The patient is currently oliguric, with a high output of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. She has a hoarse voice, likely due to vocal cord trauma, and is at risk for further complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS):** The patient's worsening renal function and oliguria may indicate a progression of HRS, which can lead to acute kidney injury and increased mortality.
2. **Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS):** The patient's abdominal distension and hypertension may exacerbate ACS, leading to further organ dysfunction and increased risk of complications.
3. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis, yeast identification in urine, sputum, and skin/ascites, and ongoing antibiotic therapy suggest a high risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. **Electrolyte Imbalances:** The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hyperphosphatemia, may exacerbate her underlying conditions and increase the risk of arrhythmias and other complications.
5. **CNS Complications:** The patient's encephalopathy and somnolent state may be indicative of further CNS complications, such as seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, or infection.
6. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's hypertension and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's ascites and abdominal distension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics closely and adjust fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
2. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed, and consider adjusting the regimen based on culture results.
3. Perform frequent neuro checks to monitor the patient's mental status and assess for potential CNS complications.
4. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to optimize management of the patient's liver disease and ascites.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further complications.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize management of the patient's cardiovascular risk factors.
7. Monitor the patient's abdominal distension and hypertension closely, and consider consulting with a surgeon to assess the risk of ACS and abdominal complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - on levophed
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 worsening, on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin (since [**3-19**]).
   Yeast identified in urine, sputum and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology
   is L abdominal eschar could be infected. Patient had diagnostic and
   therapeutic tap on [**3-24**] where 4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after
   correcting for RBCs, however gram stain negative.
   - ID following, sent b-glucan, galactomannin on [**3-25**]
   - for skin infection, getting surgery and derm c/s [**3-25**]
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds, after CVVH will change to 500mg IV Q24H
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD.  UO has basically been 0
   since transfer to ICU. Previously, patient was listed for a kidney
   transplant. Renal function is worse in the setting of Abdominal
   Compartment Syndrome. On [**3-24**],
   - since blood pressures unstable, will do CVVH.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   -back on home tegretol
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # FEN: hold TF due to protein load

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

**Chief Complaint**: The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and resolved respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, requiring dialysis.

**24-Hour Events**: The patient underwent paracentesis, multi-lumen insertion, and blood culturing. She was found to have SBP, and a yeast infection was identified in her urine, sputum, and skin/ascites. She was started on vanco, caspofungin, and lactulose. Her blood pressure was unstable, and she required intermittent HD and CVVH.

**Assessment and Plan**:

1. **Hemodynamics/Hypotension**: The patient is likely chronically hypotensive due to liver disease and has a high cardiac output. She will continue to receive fluids with boluses as needed and albumin.
2. **Leukocytosis**: The patient's leukocytosis is worsening, and she has a yeast infection. She will continue to receive vanco, caspofungin, and lactulose.
3. **AMS/Unresponsiveness**: The patient is somnolent and difficult to assess. Her differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, worsening infection, electrolyte imbalance, and renal failure. She will continue to receive lactulose and increase the dose to 60 mg qid to see if she wakes up.
4. **Hepatorenal Syndrome**: The patient's renal function is worsening, and she is oliguric. She will continue to receive intermittent HD and CVVH.
5. **Hypoxia**: The patient has transient hypoxia, possibly due to aspiration. She will continue to receive oxygen therapy and repeat CXR in the morning.
6. **Intraabdominal Bleed**: The patient's HCT is stable, and she will need IR-guided paracentesis in the future.
7. **Hoarse Voice**: The patient reports a hoarse voice following self-extubation. She will undergo ENT consultation.
8. **HCV Cirrhosis**: The patient has decompensated HCV cirrhosis with varices, massive ascites, and encephalopathy. She is awaiting transplant.
9. **DM2**: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is receiving lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia.
10. **Seizure Disorder**: The patient has a seizure disorder and is back on home tegretol.
11. **Depression/Anxiety**: The patient has depression and anxiety and is holding psych meds due to delta MS.
12. **PPx**: The patient has pneumoboots and PPI prophylaxis.
13. **FEN**: The patient's TF is being held due to protein load.
14. **Access**: The patient has RIJ and HD lines.

**Potential Medical Complications**:

1. **Sepsis**: The patient has a yeast infection and may develop sepsis.
2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she may develop worsening encephalopathy.
3. **Renal Failure**: The patient's renal function is worsening, and she may require dialysis.
4. **Pulmonary Complications**: The patient has hypoxia and may develop respiratory failure.
5. **Intraabdominal Complications**: The patient has an intraabdominal bleed and may require IR-guided paracentesis.
6. **Seizure Disorder**: The patient has a seizure disorder and may experience seizures.
7. **Depression/Anxiety**: The patient has depression and anxiety and may require psychotropic medications.

**Recommendations**:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust fluids and albumin as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's yeast infection with vanco, caspofungin, and lactulose.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust dialysis as needed.
4. Continue to provide oxygen therapy and repeat CXR in the morning.
5. Consider discussing code status with the liver team and transplant team as the patient may no longer be a transplant candidate.
6. Hold psych meds due to delta MS and consider alternative treatment options.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's HCT and plan for IR-guided paracentesis in the future.
8. Consider ENT consultation for the patient's hoarse voice.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin as needed.
10. Consider discussing the patient's depression and anxiety with the psych team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - on levophed
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 worsening, on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin (since [**3-19**]).
   Yeast identified in urine, sputum and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology
   is L abdominal eschar could be infected. Patient had diagnostic and
   therapeutic tap on [**3-24**] where 4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after
   correcting for RBCs, however gram stain negative.
   - ID following, sent b-glucan, galactomannin on [**3-25**]
   - for skin infection, getting surgery and derm c/s [**3-25**]
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds, after CVVH will change to 500mg IV Q24H
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and resolved respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with ascites and abdominal compartment syndrome, and has been diagnosed with SBP on vanco, caspofungin, and yeast identified in urine, sputum, and skin/ascites. She has also been experiencing worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 76 bpm
* BP: 106/55 mmHg
* RR: 15 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

Her physical examination reveals:

* Waxing and waning mental status
* Bilateral crackles at the bases
* Soft, massively distended abdomen with fluid wave and bowel sounds
* Stage 2 sacral ulcers
* Radial and pedal pulses are 2+ and intact

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 21.9 K/uL
* Hct: 31.9%
* Plt: 106 K/uL
* Cr: 3.6 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22 mmHg
* Glucose: 222 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.9 g/dL
* LDH: 476 IU/L
* Ca++: 10.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 8.0 mg/dL

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are:

1. Hemodynamics/hypotension: The patient is likely chronically hypotensive due to liver disease with a high cardiac output. She will continue to receive fluids with boluses as needed and albumin.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is worsening, and she has been diagnosed with SBP on vanco, caspofungin. ID follow-up is planned, and she will continue to receive vanco and caspofungin.
3. AMS/unresponsiveness: The patient is somnolent and has minimal electrolyte abnormalities. The differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, worsened by ongoing infection, electrolyte, and renal failure. She will continue to receive lactulose and will be monitored for neuro checks.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient is oliguric and has been receiving intermittent HD. Her Cr has been trending upward, and she will continue to receive intermittent HD.
5. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing transient hypoxia, which has been weaned. She will be monitored clinically and will have a repeat CXR in the morning.
6. Intraabdominal bleed: The patient has had a recent paracentesis and has been experiencing stable vital signs and HCT.
7. Hoarse voice: The patient has reported a hoarse voice following self-extubation, and an ENT consult is planned.
8. HCV cirrhosis: The patient has decompensated cirrhosis with varices, massive ascites, and encephalopathy. She is awaiting transplant and will continue to receive treatment for complications.
9. DM2: The patient is receiving Lantus for hyperglycemia and will have her long-acting insulin held while NPO.
10. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and will continue to receive home tegretol.
11. Depression/anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety and will have her psych meds held due to delta MS.
12. PPx: The patient has pneumoboots and PPI prophylaxis.
13. FEN: The patient has a hold on TF due to protein load.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of her liver and kidney function
* Development of septic shock or multi-organ failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to her thrombocytopenia
* Development of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Increased risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state
* Development of cardiac complications due to her hypotension and cardiac output

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.

   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and resolved respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring dialysis. She has undergone paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed and is awaiting liver and kidney transplant.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.6°C, Tcurrent 35.6°C, HR 76 bpm, BP 106/55 mmHg, RR 15 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 18 mmHg, CO/CI (Fick) 7 L/min/4.1 L/min/m2.
* Fluid balance: Total in 3,336 mL, total out 4,860 mL, with a negative balance of -1,524 mL.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula 3L, SpO2 99%.
* Physical examination: Generalized waxing and waning mental status, inconsistently following commands, bilateral crackles at bases, soft and massively distended abdomen, and stage 2 sacral ulcers.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* WBC 14.8, Hct 35.5, Plt 85, Cr 2.4, TCO2 22, Glucose 195.
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 29.6/45.0/3.0, ALT/AST 15/38, Alk Phos/T Bili 103/58.5, Amylase/Lipase 11/11, Differential-Neuts 88.0%, Band 2.0%, Lymph 4.0%, Mono 6.0%, Eos 0.0%, Lactic Acid 5.0 mmol/L, Albumin 3.9 g/dL, LDH 476 IU/L, Ca++ 10.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.6 mg/dL, PO4 8.0 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications are as follows:

* Hypotension: likely chronically hypotensive due to liver disease with a high cardiac output.
* Leukocytosis: worsening, already on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Yeast identified in urine, sputum, and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology is likely L.
* AMS/unresponsiveness: likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsened by ongoing infection, electrolyte imbalance, renal failure, and other differential diagnoses.
* Hepatorenal syndrome: likely triggered by 11 L para on [**2-24**] with only 25g albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.
* Hypoxia: transient in the setting of possible aspiration while unresponsive, CxR clear, on broad-spectrum antibiotics already, now O2 dependence weaned.
* Intraabdominal bleed s/p paracentesis: HCT stable, Vitals stable. Trend HCT daily at this point.
* Hoarse voice: possible vocal cord trauma.
* HCV cirrhosis: decompensated with varices, massive ascites s/p TIPS, encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
* DM2: lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin when no tube feed or maintain on D5.
* Seizure disorder: back on home tegretol.
* Depression/Anxiety: holding psych meds due to delta MS.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue fluids with boluses as needed and albumin.
* Continue vanco, caspofungin, and lactulose.
* Intermittent HD.
* F/u renal recs.
* Cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now.
* ENT consult for hoarse voice.
* Liver team following, appreciate recs.
* Consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: due to ongoing infection and leukocytosis.
* Acute kidney injury: due to hepatorenal syndrome and oliguria.
* Respiratory failure: due to hypoxia and possible aspiration.
* Cardiac failure: due to high cardiac output and hypotension.
* Neurological complications: due to AMS/unresponsiveness and possible seizure disorder.
* Gastrointestinal complications: due to intraabdominal bleed and possible sepsis.
* Infection: due to ongoing infection and leukocytosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and anuria. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has received various treatments, including paracentesis, multi-lumen placement, and infusion of norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 99% and a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 85 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) of 15 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase (AST) of 38 IU/L. The patient's kidney function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic anemia, coagulopathy, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is also at risk for developing complications such as delirium, confusion, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and high white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's impaired liver function and kidney function may increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by acute kidney injury and liver failure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures such as paracentesis and multi-lumen placement.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown and infection.
5. Delirium and confusion: The patient's medical conditions and medications may increase the risk of developing delirium and confusion.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, initially admitted
   from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD, s/p
   respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**]) and s/p paracentesis complicated
   by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated to
   day in the setting of unresponsiveness
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin
   - will tolerate low MAPs
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - pressors less likely to help with her presumed high cardiac output
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 new leukocytosis today, already on broad spectrum
   abx.  Unclear etiology
   - pan culture
   - IR guided diagnostic paracentesis today (will give FFP pre tap)
   - Id following
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   -back on home tegretol
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, and awaiting liver/kidney transplant. She was admitted from the operating room (OSH) with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, requiring HD and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: The patient is likely chronically hypotensive due to liver disease, with a high cardiac output. She has an arterial line and is receiving fluids with boluses as needed, along with albumin.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has new leukocytosis, and her blood culture is pending. She is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a diagnostic paracentesis was performed today. The etiology of the leukocytosis is unclear.
* AMS/unresponsiveness: The patient is somnolent and responds to voice, but has no focal deficit. The differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, worsened by potential infection, electrolyte imbalance, renal failure, and other possibilities. She is receiving lactulose and will have q4 neuro checks.
* Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient is likely experiencing hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by a large para-central line placed on [**2-24**]. She is currently oliguric and has been receiving intermittent HD. Her creatinine is trending upward again.
* Hypoxia: The patient has transient hypoxia, possibly due to aspiration while unresponsive. She is receiving oxygen therapy and will have a repeat CXR in the morning.
* Intraabdominal bleed: The patient had an intraabdominal bleed following paracentesis, which is being monitored. She will need IR-guided paracentesis in the future and will require platelet and FFP transfusions prior to procedures.
