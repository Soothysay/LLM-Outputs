 ANXIETY
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, coronary artery disease and
   non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia: Worsening over the past three days.  Imaging suggestive of
   multifocal pneumonia likely from aspiration.  Of concern, patient has
   been on high dose steroids for the past month.  No evidence of large
   pulmonary embolism on CT scan.  Cardiac enzymes not elevated.  Likely
   worsened by anemia.  Currently maintaining oxygen saturations with 50%
   face tent.  Not using accessory muscles currently.  ABG with
   respiratory alkalosis.  Although patient with evidence of anasarca, do
   not feel that pulmonary edema is large component of his current
   presentation.
   - vancomycin and zosyn for health care associated pneumonia
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - sputum culture
   - induced sputum for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 72**] culture, AFB
   - NPO pending speech and swallow evaluation
   - repeat EKG and cardiac enzymes
   - repeat CXR today
   Hydropneumothorax:  Noted on recent CT scan.  Concern for bronchial
   stump leak.  Surgery not performed here.
   - will consult with thoracis regarding finding
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  Per notes continues to have [**2-13**] bloody
   bowel movements per day without significant improvement since
   presentation.  Sigmoidoscopy on [**12-1**] with persistent severe
   inflammation.  Now on methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID.  No longer on
   cyclosporin. Patient with significant malnutrition and anasarca.
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - appreciate GI recs
   - continue TPN
   - NPO for now given concern for aspiration
   - GI surgery following
   - c. diff negative most recently on [**12-3**]
   Acute Blood Loss Anemia:  Patient with known gastrointestinal bleeding
   and witnessed blood loss from pulling out PICC in the setting of
   elevated INR yesterday.  Now s/p 2 units of PRBC with hematocrit
   increase from only 21.3 to 25.3.
   - active type and screen
   - currently PICC line and 1 22 g IV, will obtain additional peripheral
   access
   - repeat hematocrit tonight
   - GI following
   DV: Incidental finding of right sided lower extremity DVT.  INR
   currently 2.4.  Currently hemodynamically stable but in the setting of
   gastrointestinal bleeding will hold coumadin for now and let INRtrend
   down.  If persistent bleeding, would consider IVC filter.
   - holding coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus: In the setting of poor nutrition,
   hypoalbuminemia and bedrest.
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   Hypothyroidism: Home dose is synthroid PO 88 mcg daily
   - IV synthroid 50 mcg daily
   CAD s/p MI: No chest pain or new EKG changes currently.  Troponins
   flat.
   - holding aspirin, beta blocker (given NPO)
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   NSCLC s/p resection: As above, concern for bronchial stump leak.
   Otherwise no active issues.
   Prostate Cancer:  s/p prostatectomy. CT with sclerotic/lucent lesions
   in vertebral bodies but bone scan okay.
   - outpatient oncology followup
   Type II Diabetes:
   - receives 37 units regular insulin in TPN
   - TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, 1 22 g IV
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, protonix

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may worsen due to the underlying conditions, such as pneumonia, anemia, and bronchial stump leak.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss anemia, which may lead to further complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, fatigue, and increased risk of infection.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, which may worsen due to poor nutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and bedrest.
4. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections due to immunosuppressive therapy, prolonged hospitalization, and invasive devices.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a right-sided lower extremity DVT, and there is a risk of further thrombotic events, especially in the setting of immobilization and hypercoagulability.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may worsen due to continued bleeding from the bronchial stump leak or other underlying conditions.
7. Malnutrition: The patient has significant malnutrition, which may worsen due to NPO status, and may lead to further complications, such as decreased immune function, wound healing impairment, and increased risk of infection.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may worsen due to continued NPO status and may lead to further complications, such as decreased metabolism, fatigue, and increased risk of infection.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has coronary artery disease and a history of myocardial infarction, which may worsen due to continued immobilization, hypercoagulability, and underlying cardiac conditions.
10. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and has undergone surgical resection, which may lead to further neurological complications, such as cognitive impairment, seizures, and increased risk of infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has been diagnosed with acute blood loss anemia, respiratory failure, and anxiety. He is receiving treatment for pneumonia, and his condition is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's condition is worsening, and there is a risk of further complications, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and death.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could worsen his condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and could worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is likely related to his condition and could worsen if not managed effectively.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is not being adequately managed, and there is a risk of worsening hypothyroidism if not treated promptly.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, and there is a risk of further malnutrition if not managed effectively.
7. DVT: The patient has a DVT, and there is a risk of further complications, such as pulmonary embolism, if not treated promptly.
8. Hydropneumothorax: The patient has a hydropneumothorax, and there is a risk of further complications, such as bronchial stump leak, if not treated promptly.
9. Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus: The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, and there is a risk of further complications, such as infection, if not managed effectively.
10. Prostate Cancer: The patient has prostate cancer, and there is a risk of further complications, such as metastasis, if not managed effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care if his condition worsens.
3. Continue to manage the patient's anemia, respiratory failure, and anxiety effectively.
4. Consider starting thyroid replacement therapy to manage the patient's hypothyroidism.
5. Consider starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to manage the patient's malnutrition.
6. Consider anticoagulation therapy to manage the patient's DVT.
7. Consider surgical intervention to manage the patient's hydropneumothorax.
8. Consider wound care to manage the patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus.
9. Consider oncological follow-up to manage the patient's prostate cancer.
10. Consider considering palliative care to manage the patient's symptoms and improve his quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient has a multifocal pneumonia likely due to aspiration, anemia, and immunosuppression. He also has a hydropneumothorax, presumed ulcerative colitis, acute blood loss anemia, and a right-sided lower extremity DVT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his multifocal pneumonia, anemia, and immunosuppression.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and anemia may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and continued bleeding from the PICC line may lead to further bleeding complications.
4. DVT: The patient's right-sided lower extremity DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism or further complications if not managed properly.
5. Wound Complications: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as infection or osteomyelitis.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, or cognitive impairment.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and non-small cell lung cancer may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppression and ongoing medical treatments may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as weakness, fatigue, or impaired wound healing.
10. Anemia: The patient's acute blood loss anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, or impaired wound healing.

Based on these potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting his treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a history of underlying conditions such as severe emphysema, recent VATS surgery, and probable aspiration pneumonia. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, anemia, anxiety, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has also developed hydropneumothorax, likely related to recent surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of bleeding.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient's bleeding from the upper GI tract may continue or worsen, leading to further anemia and potential complications.
4. Colitis: The patient's severe colitis may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to further complications, such as infection, sepsis, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines and tubes may increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's underlying CAD and recent VATS surgery may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's compromised respiratory and cardiovascular status may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, seizures, and stroke.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* He is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements, tacypnea, and hypoxia.
* He has a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute anemia, and impaired skin integrity.
* He is receiving mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen therapy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a high risk of developing pneumonia due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of multifocal pneumonia on imaging.
2. **Aspiration:** The patient has already had a witnessed aspiration event, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia and other respiratory complications.
3. **Bleeding:** The patient has ongoing bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract, which may lead to further blood loss and anemia.
4. **DVT:** The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk of developing further thrombosis, especially with his prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters.
5. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure, due to his respiratory distress and anemia.
6. **Infections:** The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of central venous catheters.
7. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient is at risk of developing malnutrition due to his inability to take oral nutrition and his prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's delirium and confusion will be managed with sedation and neuromuscular blockade.
* The patient's anemia will be managed with blood transfusions and iron supplementation.
* The patient's respiratory failure will be managed with mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen therapy.
* The patient's impaired skin integrity will be managed with wound care and pressure ulcer prevention measures.
* The patient's anxiety will be managed with anxiolytic medications and relaxation techniques.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy, coronary artery disease and
   non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia/Possible PNA: Required 95% high flow after witnessed aspiration
   but now back to 60%; previous CT consistant with multifocal pneumonia
   and aspiration.  Also concern for immunosuppressed state given chronic
   steroid use.  ABG with continued respiratory alkalosis.
   - consider switch vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  continue w/ bloody bowel movement with
   HCT drop.
   - 2 units RBC this am
   - q8 HCT checks
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID

   additional souce of bleeding
   - active type and screen
   - q8 HCT checks
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.  INR elevated but
   trending down (1.7)
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - if hematocrit stable, start heparin when subtherapeutic
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - holding PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and dyspnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has acute respiratory failure, with a witnessed aspiration event overnight, which required increased oxygen therapy. His oxygen requirement has decreased from 95% to 60%. He has a history of emphysema and is being treated with albuterol and ipratropium.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and has had a myocardial infarction in the past. He has frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry, likely due to respiratory distress and anemia.
* Hematological: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL. He has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being monitored with q8 HCT checks.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is experiencing bloody stools with a hemoglobin drop. He is being treated with methylprednisolone and is having his hemoglobin levels checked q8.
* Infectious: The patient has a suspected pulmonary infection, with a CT scan showing multifocal pneumonia and aspiration. He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and a sputum culture is being attempted.
* Neurological: The patient has delirium and confusion, which is being treated with antipsychotic medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state makes him more susceptible to infection, particularly pulmonary infections.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and continued bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can lead to further complications, including cardiac arrest.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction makes him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ulcerative colitis and ongoing bleeding can lead to further gastrointestinal complications, including perforation and sepsis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Oxygen therapy
* Antibiotics for suspected pulmonary infection
* Blood transfusions for anemia
* Medication for delirium and confusion
* Nutrition support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Wound care for sacral/buttock decubitus
* Telemetry monitoring for cardiac status

The patient's code status is full code, and he is being monitored closely in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent a VATS lobectomy for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer. The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia with acute blood loss, colitis, elevated BUN, and decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further desaturation, increased oxygen requirements, and potential intubation.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent surgery and severe emphysema may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status.
3. Sepsis: The patient's colitis and potential GI bleed may lead to sepsis, which could further complicate his respiratory and cardiovascular status.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia with acute blood loss may worsen, leading to further bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and potential cardiac complications.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen, leading to increased risk of infection, tissue damage, and potential amputation.
6. Wound Infection: The patient's recent surgery and colitis may increase the risk of wound infection, which could lead to further complications and potential sepsis.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and recent surgery may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and potential cardiac arrest.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypothyroidism and recent surgery may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and potential neurological deficits.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition, manage his respiratory and cardiovascular status, and address his underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of underlying conditions, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer. They have undergone a recent VATS surgery and are currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to severe emphysema, aspiration pneumonia, and hydropneumothorax.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 95/47 mmHg (60/44 mmHg - 135/119 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 28 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 3.9-5.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 116-120 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: awake and alert
* Cardiovascular: normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Abdominal: soft
* Skin: warm
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: continue with NPO status, speech and swallow evaluation pending, and continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Hydropneumothorax: likely related to recent surgery
* Anemia: likely due to GI bleeding
* Colitis: severe, treated with TPN, and will be reevaluated once more stable
* Elevated BUN: likely due to upper GI bleed and steroids
* Decubitus ulcer: present
* NSCLC: need to follow up on pathology and cultures

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of hypoxic respiratory failure, development of pneumonia, or respiratory arrest
* Sepsis: development of sepsis syndrome, septic shock, or multi-organ failure
* GI bleeding: worsening of anemia, development of bleeding complications, or need for transfusions
* Colitis: worsening of colitis, development of perforation, or need for surgical intervention
* Decubitus ulcer: worsening of decubitus ulcer, development of sepsis, or need for surgical intervention
* NSCLC: progression of cancer, development of metastases, or need for further treatment

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Hypoxia/Possible PNA: Requiring 95% high flow; previous CT consistant
   with multifocal pneumonia and aspiration.  Also concern for
   immunosuppressed state given chronic steroid use.  ABG with continued
   respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   - watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress.
   Presumed Ulcerative Colitis:  continue w/ bloody bowel movement with
   HCT drop.
   - 2 units RBC yesterday with stablization of Hct to 28

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and dyspnea. He is currently on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and has a history of chronic steroid use. The patient has a presumed ulcerative colitis with bloody bowel movements and a Hct drop, which was stabilized with 2 units of RBC yesterday. He also has a slow GI bleed and is on TPN. The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and was on coumadin, but his INR is currently elevated and trending down.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* HR: 107 bpm (92-120 bpm)
* BP: 141/51 mmHg (69-141/103 mmHg)
* RR: 27 inspirations per minute (19-37 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's lab results show:

* Hct: 28%
* WBC: 3.9-5.8 K/uL
* Plt: 120-87 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 24-25 mmHg
* Glucose: 108-146 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.7/31.3/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 46/4/<0.01, Differential-Neuts: 86.0%, Band: 7.0%, Lymph: 5.0%, Mono: 2.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Lactic Acid: 2.5 mmol/L, Ca++: 6.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, and he has a history of chronic steroid use, which may exacerbate his respiratory distress.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 28%, which is below the normal range, and he has a history of chronic blood loss.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer, which may lead to infection and further complications.
4. DVT: The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and was on coumadin, but his INR is currently elevated and trending down.
5. Hydropneumothorax: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and had a hydropneumothorax after resection, which may recur.
6. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and had a myocardial infarction, which may lead to further complications.
7. Type II diabetes: The patient is on TPN with regular insulin and has a history of type II diabetes, which may lead to further complications.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic steroid use, which may increase his risk of infection.
9. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of malnutrition, which may exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Albuterol
* Ipratropium
* Methylprednisolone
* TPN

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU care for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

He is on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy and has a history of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (92-120 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 141/51 mmHg (69-112 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (19-37 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* ABG: 7.55/25/77 (pH, PaCO2, and PaO2)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tremulous and anxious
* Mildly dry mucous membranes
* No murmur or wheezes
* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* Radial and pedal pulses 2+ and 1+, respectively
* Trace lower extremity edema
* Alert and oriented to self

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28%
* White blood cell count: 3.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 120 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 24 mmol/L
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Acute respiratory failure
* Anemia
* Impaired skin integrity
* Anxiety
* Ulcerative colitis
* Non-small cell lung cancer
* Coronary artery disease
* DVT (left femoral vein)
* Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus
* Type II diabetes

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure worsening
* Anemia exacerbating
* Skin breakdown progressing
* Anxiety leading to increased respiratory distress
* Ulcerative colitis worsening
* Non-small cell lung cancer progression
* Coronary artery disease worsening
* DVT embolization
* Sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer worsening
* Type II diabetes complications (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia)

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
* Continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
* Watch for fatigue given continued respiratory distress
* Continue tapering immunosuppressive therapy for ulcerative colitis
* Continue TPN for nutrition
* Continue heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis
* Continue to monitor for signs of bleeding
* Consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
* Consider restarting statin use if LDL levels are low and malnutrition is improved
* Continue telemetry monitoring for cardiac rhythm
* Continue wound care for sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer
* Continue to monitor electrolytes and adjust TPN as needed"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has a history of aspiration and immunosuppressed state due to chronic steroid use. He is currently receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 141/51 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute anxiety, and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 82 indicates that he is still experiencing respiratory distress, which may lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL, which is below the normal range. This may lead to further complications such as heart failure, decreased cardiac output, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired due to his stage II sacral/buttock decubitus, which may lead to further complications such as wound infection, sepsis, and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may exacerbate his respiratory distress and lead to further complications such as panic attacks, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation.
5. Type II Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose level is 146 mg/dL, which is above the normal range. This may lead to further complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and increased risk of infections.
6. Chronic Steroid Use: The patient's chronic steroid use may lead to further complications such as adrenal insufficiency, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections.
7. Aspiration: The patient's history of aspiration may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and prolonged hospital stay.
8. Immunosuppressed State: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to chronic steroid use may lead to further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, and increased risk of infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a critically ill individual with ongoing tachypnea and acute respiratory alkalosis. They have a history of pneumonia, GI bleed, and anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and antibiotics, and their oxygen saturation levels are stable at 97%. However, their tachypnea persists, and their CXR is stable.

The patient's laboratory results show a declining platelet count, and their Hct has improved with transfusions. They have a history of maroon-colored stool and have received 2 units of PRBCs.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, with clear breath sounds on the right side and bronchial sounds on the left base. Their abdomen is soft and non-tender, and their extremities show trace edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing tachypnea and acute respiratory alkalosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss and inadequate transfusions.
3. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed may recur or worsen, leading to further blood loss and anemia.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to worsening respiratory failure and increased risk of complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to ongoing respiratory distress, anemia, and other underlying medical conditions.
6. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen due to ongoing respiratory distress and anemia.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to their endotracheal tube and respiratory support.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and antibiotics.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting their respiratory support as needed.
3. Continue transfusions to maintain the patient's Hct and platelet count.
4. Monitor the patient's GI bleed and consider endoscopy or other diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the bleed.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of their sputum culture.
6. Monitor the patient's delirium and consider implementing interventions to reduce their risk of delirium, such as reorientation therapy and sleep promotion.
7. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and consider implementing measures to reduce their risk of skin breakdown, such as turning and repositioning.
8. Consider implementing VAP prevention measures, such as elevating the patient's head of bed and using a VAP-reducing device."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on invasive ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 142, indicating severe hypoxemia.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension, requiring levophed and fluids. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, but frequent PVCs and tachycardia are noted.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a Hct of 21.9%. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* Neurological: The patient is delirious and has impaired skin integrity.
* Infectious: The patient has pneumonia and aspiration, and is receiving antibiotics.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has ulcerative colitis and is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy. The patient has bloody bowel movements and a Hct drop, but after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells, the Hct stabilized at 28%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 142, indicating severe hypoxemia. The patient may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as prone ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and the use of anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ulcerative colitis and bloody bowel movements may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* DVT: The patient's left femoral vein DVT and the use of anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of DVT.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue vanc/Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
* Continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
* Monitor for fatigue given continued respiratory distress
* Taper immunosuppressive therapy for ulcerative colitis
* Continue TPN for nutrition
* Hold PO meds (vitamin C, zinc)
* Wound care for stage II sacral/buttock decubitus
* Continue telemetry for CAD s/p MI
* Consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
* Statin held during this admission due to low LDL and malnutrition
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis. He has also been diagnosed with anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 91/53 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93%. He has a sinus rhythm and is intubated.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 21.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 87 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated lactate level.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, and ulcerative colitis, and he has undergone a left upper lobectomy and VATs. He is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy for his ulcerative colitis and has a history of bleeding and hematochezia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis increases his risk of developing further infections, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and impaired skin integrity increase his risk of bleeding, which could lead to life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent MI increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's impaired gut function and requirement for TPN increase his risk of nutritional deficiencies, which could lead to further complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's delirium and confusion require close monitoring and management. His anemia and impaired skin integrity require further evaluation and treatment. His respiratory failure requires ongoing management with ARDSnet protocol and close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation. His infection requires continued treatment with antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of sepsis. His bleeding risk requires close monitoring and potential treatment with anticoagulation therapy. His cardiac complications require close monitoring and potential treatment with beta blockers and anticoagulation therapy. His nutritional deficiencies require close monitoring and potential treatment with nutritional supplements."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now meets ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has several comorbidities, including anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute, anxiety, and type II diabetes. He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his history of DVT and is currently on heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. His respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, and oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress to respiratory failure, requiring further respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's suspected HAP and aspiration pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
3. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and current use of heparin may increase his risk of developing a new DVT.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding may increase his risk of hemorrhage, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
8. Skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
10. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and meets ARDS criteria with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has marked hypotension, requiring levophed and fluids. His heart rate is 88 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 91/53 mmHg.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 21.9 g/dL. He has received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and not responsive. He has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3.
* Infectious disease: The patient has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected HAP/Aspiration PNA.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has ulcerative colitis, with a bloody bowel movement and a drop in hemoglobin level. He is receiving methylprednisolone and is being followed by the gastroenterology team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's underlying medical conditions and recent antibiotic use increase his risk of developing sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent blood transfusion may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of heparin and levophed.
* Wound infection: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer may become infected, leading to further complications.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ulcerative colitis and recent blood transfusion may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and ARDSnet protocol
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Continuing treatment for HAP/Aspiration PNA and monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Managing the patient's anemia with further blood transfusions as needed
* Continuing wound care and monitoring for signs of infection
* Monitoring the patient's cardiovascular status and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Continuing to follow the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and adjusting therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, ARDS, anemia, and GI bleed. The patient is intubated and ventilated, with a history of bleeding and blood loss.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/50 mmHg. The patient is receiving fluids, and the fluid balance is positive. The patient's respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, and oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL. The platelet count is dropping, with a current level of 58 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L.

The patient's radiology results show bilateral alveolar infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which is consistent with the diagnosis of ARDS.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Delirium/confusion
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Anxiety
* ARDS
* Pneumonia

The patient's plan includes:

* Restarting stress dose steroids
* Weaning norepinephrine
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Transfusing with 2 units of blood
* Maintaining fluid balance
* Managing respiratory support
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further respiratory deterioration
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Progression of anemia
* Increased risk of bleeding
* Development of pressure ulcers or skin integrity issues
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged intubation and ventilation
* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalances

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110.  Intubated
   for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been treated with vanc/zosyn
   atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Try pressure support for now to see if this helps his MV
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA
   - Add Levofloxacin
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   BRPBR: Patient had two episodes BRBPR o/n losing approximately 1 L
   fluid and is s/p 2U PRBC. Appropriate Hct improvement. Gi aware
   - Continue to trend Hct
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 2 U this AM.
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - continue methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
   - GI following
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Continue heparin gtt and monitor for signs of bleeding
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, Heparin gtt, protonix
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Started on stress dose steroids in the event his hypotension was
   related.  Was also thought to be possible treatment for non-infectious
   pulm process, as pt had failed to improve on abx.
   - Became tachycardic in the afternoon- responded to 1L saline.
   - Difficult to syncronize the patient to the vent, as he keeps
   overbreathing with high minute ventilation.  Lavage with ? clot.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and is being treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110.

The patient has had several complications, including:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has required vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped to 22, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 58, which is low.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.34 and a bicarbonate level of 19 mmol/L.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 138 mmol/L, which is elevated.
6. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, which is a severe form of acute lung injury.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not improving despite treatment with mechanical ventilation.
8. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap acidosis, which is unclear in etiology.
9. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has ulcerative colitis, which is being managed with chronic immunosuppressive therapy.
10. DVT: The patient has a left femoral vein DVT, which is being treated with heparin.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110.
2. Vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Packed red blood cell transfusions to treat anemia.
4. Platelet transfusions to treat thrombocytopenia.
5. Antibiotics to treat possible infections.
6. Heparin therapy to treat DVT.
7. Chronic immunosuppressive therapy to manage ulcerative colitis.
8. TPN to provide nutrition.

The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-inch tall individual who is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a history of respiratory failure, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, and anxiety.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's hemoglobin concentration decreased from 27.4 to 21.9, requiring two units of packed red blood cells (RBC) and stress dose steroids. They also experienced two episodes of bradycardia requiring two units of RBC and were made DNR.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (87-119 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 111/66 mmHg (82-123/71 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (16-30 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Spontaneous minute ventilation: 709 mL (555-709 mL)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 21.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 58 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour
* Norepinephrine at 0.03 mcg/Kg/min
* Fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) at [**2146-12-11**] 08:13 AM
* Other medications include antibiotics, which were discontinued due to failure to improve.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and their spontaneous minute ventilation is above the set value, indicating overbreathing. This may lead to respiratory acidosis and further compromise their respiratory function.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing, which may lead to further anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and they have received two units of RBC, which may indicate ongoing bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, which may indicate a risk of infection. However, the patient's white blood cell count is normal, which may suggest that the antibiotics are not effective.
5. Delirium: The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, which may be related to their underlying medical condition, medications, or other factors.
6. Skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase their risk of infection and further compromise their overall condition.
7. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which may be related to their underlying medical condition, pain, or other factors.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management to address their respiratory, hematological, and metabolic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n). Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress dosed steroids
   for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since stress dose
   steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: SOB
   24 Hour Events:
   - HCT dropped to 22 in AM.  Pt recieved 2U RBC and bumped
   appropriately.
   - D/c hep gtt
   - Started on stress dose steroids in the event his hypotension was
   related.  Was also thought to be possible treatment for non-infectious
   pulm process, as pt had failed to improve on abx.
   - Became tachycardic in the afternoon- responded to 1L saline.
   - Difficult to syncronize the patient to the vent, as he keeps
   overbreathing with high minute ventilation.  Lavage with ? clot.
   - Spoke with the patient's family and the patient was made DNR.
   - Had 2 BRBPR since midnight requiring 2U RBC; GI made aware

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n) and now Hct 27. Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress
   dosed steroids for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since
   stress dose steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage
   - ARDSnet protocol with low tidal volumes -> very difficult as patient
   has high minute ventilation and sedation causes him to be hypotensive
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples - ? PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean levophed as tolerated
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A yesterday without ketones
   - recheck lactate today
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   Hypotension
 On stress dose steroids Hydrocortisone. Ddx adrenal
   insufficiency vs hypovolemia.
   - Fluid bolus prn for hypotsn
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.Continues w/ bloody bowel movement with HCT drop in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation 28 -> 22, transfused 4 u yesterday (2
   am, 2 o/n) and now Hct 27. Transitioned methylprednisolone to stress
   dosed steroids for hypotension. BP not significantly improved since
   stress dose steroids.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - methylprednisolone 10 mg IV TID
 Hydrocortoisone
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - Check plain film Abd
 upright and decub
   - continue TPN
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's condition remains critical. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 112, meeting the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
* He has a history of ulcerative colitis, non-small cell lung cancer, and coronary artery disease.
* The patient has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected HAP/Aspiration PNA.
* He has a DNR code status.
* The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and his platelet count is currently 58 K/uL.
* He has a history of DVT and is currently on stress dose steroids for hypotension.
* The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer and has undergone VATs and left upper lobectomy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **ARDS**: The patient's PO2/FiO2 ratio is 112, indicating severe hypoxia. This may lead to further respiratory failure and potential complications such as barotrauma, pneumothorax, or respiratory acidosis.
2. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's platelet count is 58 K/uL, which is below the normal range. This may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. **Hypotension**: The patient's blood pressure is 111/66 mmHg, which may indicate inadequate blood volume or cardiac output. This may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. **Metabolic Acidosis**: The patient has a high anion gap acidosis, which may be due to lactate production or other metabolic derangements. This may lead to further organ dysfunction or failure.
5. **Infection**: The patient has a history of HAP/Aspiration PNA and is receiving antibiotics. However, the patient's WBC count is 6.6, which may indicate an underlying infection.
6. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding**: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and has experienced bloody bowel movements. This may lead to further bleeding complications or perforation.
7. **DVT**: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on stress dose steroids. This may increase the risk of further thrombotic complications.
8. **Anxiety and Delirium**: The patient is experiencing anxiety and delirium, which may be due to the underlying medical condition or the use of sedatives.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust fluid management as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust medication as needed.
* Consider bronchoscopy for samples to rule out PCP.
* Consider weaning levophed as tolerated.
* Continue to hold heparin and coumadin.
* Continue to monitor the patient's wound care and consider sigmoidoscopy.
* Continue to monitor the patient's nutrition and consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and interventions. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* Respiratory status: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 22, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 7 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, and arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 112, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient's blood pressure is 112/67 mmHg, and heart rate is 99 beats per minute. The patient's peripheral vascular status is compromised, with diminished radial pulses on both sides.
* Neurological status: The patient is responsive to verbal stimuli, with purposeful movements and normal tone.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 6.6 K/uL, and platelet count is 58 K/uL.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 22 mEq/L.
* Metabolic status: The patient's blood glucose level is 138 mg/dL, and lactate level is 1.5 mmol/L.
* Skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, with a history of bleeding and blood loss.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's compromised peripheral vascular status and blood pressure fluctuations increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding and blood loss increase the risk of further hemorrhage.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune status and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and further deterioration could lead to renal failure.
* Metabolic derangements: The patient's blood glucose and lactate levels are abnormal, and further deterioration could lead to metabolic derangements.
* Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and potential infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss. On
   stress dose steroids for AI. Unclear source of infection
 no positive
   cultures.  Possibly due to aspiration pneumonia.
   -          Levophed for MAP > 60
   -          Stress dose steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and likely aspiration. He has been treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, and his blood pressure is unstable. He has a history of DVT in his left femoral vein and is on coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, and his oxygen requirements are increasing. He has a high risk of developing respiratory failure, which may lead to further intubation or even death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he has a high risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Acute Ischemia: The patient's BRBPR (blood loss, anemia, and decreased blood pressure) may be caused by acute ischemia, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia may worsen his respiratory failure and increase his risk of developing sepsis.
5. DVT: The patient's history of DVT in his left femoral vein and his current unstable blood pressure may increase his risk of developing further DVTs or pulmonary embolisms.
6. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis may worsen his condition and increase his risk of developing sepsis, respiratory failure, or other complications.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen his condition and increase his risk of developing sepsis, respiratory failure, or other complications.
8. GI Bleeding: The patient's BRBPR may be caused by GI bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death if not treated promptly.
9. Kidney Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) may indicate kidney failure, which can worsen his condition and increase his risk of death.
10. Infection: The patient's unstable blood pressure and decreased urine output may indicate infection, which can worsen his condition and increase his risk of death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Respiratory failure: Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely
   aspiration. On Vanc/zosyn/levo. Low airway pressures and good lung
   compliance not consistent with ARDS.
   -          Try PS today
 follow peak pressures
   -           continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   BRBPR: s/p 4 units. GI input appreciated. Could be c/w acute ischemia

   -          Follow Hct
   -          Plan as per GI
 sigmoidoscopy?
   -          Active T&C
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss. On
   stress dose steroids for AI. Unclear source of infection
 no positive
   cultures.  Possibly due to aspiration pneumonia.
   -          Levophed for MAP > 55
   -          Stress dose steroids
   -          F/U cultures
   -          Will consider bronch tomorrow if not improving
   Ulcerative Colitis:  On Chronic immunosuppression without releif (now
   tapering per GI as it isn

   patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical candidate now.
   BRBPR as per above.
   -          Continue TPN
   -          ABD X-ray
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
          -       continue to hold coumadin

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.
* He is intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration, and is receiving antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, and Levo).
* The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level (Hct) and has received 4 units of blood.
* He is experiencing hypotension, likely due to septic shock, worsened by acute blood loss, and is receiving levophed and stress dose steroids.
* The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and is on heparin therapy.
* He has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is receiving ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged intubation and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Sepsis and septic shock due to uncontrolled infection, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
* Acute ischemia and necrosis of the gut due to hypoperfusion, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion, sepsis, and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
* Metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalance due to stress and potential use of corticosteroids.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status, as well as aggressive treatment of any potential infections and complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hemoglobin has been trending down. He is being treated for hypovolemic shock, and his blood pressure is being monitored closely. He is also being treated for aspiration pneumonia, and his lung function is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored closely, and he is being treated with fluids and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration, and his lung function is being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further respiratory complications.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hemoglobin is being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for respiratory failure, and his lung function is being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further respiratory complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and his blood cultures are being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further septic complications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and his platelet count is being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further bleeding complications.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient has a history of hypocalcemia, and his calcium levels are being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further complications.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, and his sodium levels are being monitored closely to ensure that he is not developing further complications.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust his vasopressor therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's lung function closely and adjust his respiratory therapy as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin closely and adjust his transfusion therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and adjust his platelet transfusion therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's calcium and sodium levels closely and adjust his electrolyte therapy as needed.
6. Continue to treat the patient's aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics and respiratory therapy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust his transfusion therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, is admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea.
* The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with 4 episodes of melenaic stool since midnight, and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
* The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 bpm. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on 60% FiO2.
* The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn.
* The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 25.9 g/dL, and is receiving transfusions.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 46,000/μL.
* The patient has a history of left femoral vein deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with warfarin.
* The patient has a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has undergone resection and hydropneumothorax.
* The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and wound care.
* The patient has type II diabetes and is being treated with insulin and sliding scale insulin.
* The patient has a DNR code status and is receiving ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue to worsen, leading to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and aspiration pneumonia diagnosis make it likely that the patient will continue to experience respiratory distress and potentially develop further complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may continue to worsen, leading to further complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening consequences.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may continue to worsen, leading to further bleeding complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of left femoral vein DVT and ongoing anticoagulation therapy make it likely that the patient will continue to experience DVT-related complications.
6. Sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer may continue to worsen, leading to further complications such as infection, osteomyelitis, and potentially life-threatening consequences.
7. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient's history of NSCLC and ongoing treatment make it likely that the patient will continue to experience complications related to the cancer, such as recurrence, metastasis, and potentially life-threatening consequences.
8. Type II diabetes: The patient's type II diabetes may continue to worsen, leading to further complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and potentially life-threatening consequences.

Overall, the patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has had 4 episodes of melanotic stool since midnight, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient's Hct is trending down, which may indicate ongoing blood loss.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's BP is 104/54 mmHg, which may indicate hypovolemia. The patient's HR is 97 bpm, which may indicate tachycardia due to hypovolemia.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110, which meets the criteria for ARDS. The patient is intubated and on pressure control ventilation.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CXR and a history of aspiration. The patient is at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
5. Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP): The patient has a history of long-standing steroid use, which increases the risk of PCP. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CXR and is being considered for bronchoscopy to rule out PCP.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap acidosis, which may be due to various causes, including infection, kidney disease, or liver disease.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 46, which is low. The patient is at risk for bleeding.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left femoral vein DVT and is at risk for further clot formation.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, non-small cell lung cancer, and hydropneumothorax. The patient's frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry may indicate cardiac complications.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished, which may increase the risk of complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to hold heparin and monitor for bleeding.
2. Administer stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
3. Increase PEEP to 10 cmH2O to improve oxygenation.
4. Consider bronchoscopy to rule out PCP.
5. Continue TPN and monitor for metabolic acidosis.
6. Monitor platelet count and transfuse if less than 10.
7. Consider restarting beta blocker use if BP is stable.
8. Continue to monitor for DVT and consider IVC filter placement.
9. Monitor for cardiac complications and consider TTE to assess cardiac function.
10. Consider transfer to floor in the afternoon.

The patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure, anemia, and potential skin integrity issues. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PCV mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. 

The patient has had four episodes of melenaic stool since midnight, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 28 to 25.9% over the past 24 hours, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient's platelet count is 46, which is low, but not critically low. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an inflammatory response. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 217 mg/dL and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 39 mg/dL. The patient's potassium levels are low, at 3.4 mEq/L. 

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and pantoprazole. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and their glycemic control is being monitored. 

The patient's potential medical complications include ongoing respiratory failure, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential skin integrity issues. The patient's anemia may be secondary to blood loss, and the patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction or injury. The patient's low potassium levels may indicate hypokalemia, which can have serious consequences if left untreated. 

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with ongoing respiratory failure, anemia, and potential skin integrity issues. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and liver dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation with a PCV+assist mode.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/62 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91% on 60% FiO2, and they are receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam.

The patient has a history of bleeding, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and a platelet count of 46. They are also experiencing respiratory failure, with a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and a respiratory system compliance of 27 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and troponin, indicating potential cardiac and renal dysfunction. They also have anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with some component of pulmonary edema. The plan includes an echocardiogram, bronchoscopy, and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. GI bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is being monitored, and the plan is to begin diuresis as the patient's blood pressure improves.
3. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and will be placed on heparin without a bolus until an IVC filter is inserted.
4. ICU care: The patient is receiving ICU care, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for intubation.
* Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac enzymes suggest potential cardiac dysfunction, which can worsen and lead to cardiac arrest.
* Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which can worsen and lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding can worsen, leading to further anemia and potential need for blood transfusions.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT, which can worsen and lead to pulmonary embolism or chronic venous insufficiency.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can worsen and lead to sepsis or septic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting (N/V). The patient has undergone various diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, including trans-thoracic echo, angiography, and bronchoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac output of 4.44 L/min, with a systemic vascular resistance index of 1,274 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. The patient's platelet count is 25 K/uL, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is 2.2. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, with a total bilirubin level of 0.4 mg/dL and an albumin level of 1.2 g/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with acute respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygenation index is 97, and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is 35 mmHg.

The patient's skin integrity is impaired, with a history of ulcerative colitis and a current diagnosis of altered mental status, not delirium. The patient has a history of anxiety and is at risk for delirium and confusion.

The patient's medication list includes antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to manage their various medical conditions. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, and their glycemic control is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and bleeding history increase the risk of hemorrhage, which can lead to further blood loss and organ dysfunction.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and history of anxiety increase the risk of delirium, which can lead to further cognitive impairment and increased risk of complications.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of foreign bodies (e.g., central lines, arterial lines) increase the risk of infection.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular instability and organ dysfunction.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, but the patient's history of liver disease and potential liver dysfunction increase the risk of liver-related complications.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's compromised kidney function and potential kidney dysfunction increase the risk of renal-related complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and optimize outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is nausea and vomiting.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic procedures, including trans-thoracic echo, angiography, and bronchoscopy. The echo revealed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation. The patient has been treated with caspofungin, and an IVC filter has been placed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left base, and the patient has 2+ radial and 1+ pedal pulses. The patient's skin is soft and non-tender, with trace lower extremity edema.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, ulcerative colitis, delirium, acute respiratory failure, anxiety, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated lactate levels and acute kidney injury, there is a risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress, leading to further compromise of kidney function.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
6. Infection: The patient's presence of an IVC filter and the patient's risk of bleeding increase the risk of infection.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation and distress.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. The patient should continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's anemia should be treated with packed red blood cells, and the patient's acute kidney injury should be managed with fluid and electrolyte replacement. The patient's delirium should be managed with pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The patient's skin integrity should be monitored closely, and the patient should be turned and repositioned regularly to prevent pressure ulcers."

   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now. 4 bloody bms since MN [**12-11**]. No bloody BM o/n and Hct
   stable but trending down.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - f/u final read Abd plain film [**12-11**]
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - Will consider bronchoscopy for samples to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**])
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Hold hep gtt for GIB
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be DIC.
   Unlikely HIT as he was on coumadin without SQ heparin prior to
   transfer, and just started on heparin yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: NPO as pt had witnessed aspiration.
   - reconsult speech and swallow
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN
   - tachycardia responded to 1 L NS bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy tube in place. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his hemoglobin level is trending down. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110, and has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 25-30 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.7-5.3 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anion-gap acidosis
* DVT (deep vein thrombosis)
* Hypotension
* Hypoxemia
* Respiratory failure
* Non-small cell lung cancer
* Coronary artery disease
* Ulcerative colitis
* Type II diabetes

The patient's medications include:

* Caspofungin
* Vancomycin
* Zosyn
* Levofloxacin
* Midazolam
* Fentanyl
* Argatroban
* Pantoprazole
* Albuterol
* Ipratropium
* Statin (held during this admission)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Aspiration pneumonia
* Pulmonary embolism
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ failure
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Thrombotic events (e.g., DVT, pulmonary embolism)

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency
* Monitor lactate and electrolytes
* Continue TPN for nutrition
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Consider bronchoscopy for samples to rule out PCP
* Continue vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP/Aspiration PNA
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and hypoxemia
* Consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
* Continue telemetry monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and to address the patient's underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, is admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tacypnea. The patient has developed DVT and BRBPR, and is currently on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 94 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* SpO2: 93%

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 70%. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and long-standing steroid use, which raises concerns for possible PCP.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 25 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.2 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.0 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is being treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has a diagnosis of anion-gap acidosis, with an unclear etiology.

The patient's current medications include:

* Caspofungin: 50 mg every 12 hours
* Midazolam: 1 mg/hour
* Fentanyl: 75 mcg/hour
* Argatroban: 2.25 mcg/kg/min
* Pantoprazole: 40 mg every 12 hours
* Albuterol: 5 mg every 4 hours
* Ipratropium: 0.5 mg every 4 hours
* TPN with lipids: 83 mL/hour

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy and has a platelet count of 25 x 10^9/L, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy, which increases the risk of infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a diagnosis of ARDS, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is currently on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a diagnosis of anion-gap acidosis and is receiving TPN, which increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
8. Wound complications: The patient has a stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer, which increases the risk of wound complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status.
2. Adjust the patient's anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent bleeding and pulmonary embolism.
3. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent and treat infection.
4. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the settings as necessary to optimize the patient's respiratory status.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the TPN as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
6. Continue to provide wound care and consider adding additional therapies to promote wound healing.
7. Consider restarting beta blocker therapy to manage the patient's hypertension and tachycardia.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust the therapy as necessary to prevent cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer who was transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (DVT), and bronchopneumonia. He has undergone several interventions, including transesophageal echocardiogram, angiography, and bronchoscopy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure control ventilation mode. His oxygenation is still a concern, with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 97.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has coronary artery disease and is experiencing frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 108/61 mmHg, and his central venous pressure is 10 cmH2O.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27 mg/dL.
* Liver: The patient's bilirubin level is 0.5 mg/dL, and his alkaline phosphatase level is 62 U/L.
* Coagulation: The patient has thrombocytopenia and is being treated with Argatroban for possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
* Infection: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Aspergillus, and his blood, sputum, and urine cultures are pending.
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of lung cancer and recent bronchoscopy increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's positive sputum culture for Aspergillus and the presence of other potential sources of infection (e.g., urinary tract infection) increase the risk of developing sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL and BUN level of 27 mg/dL suggest that he may be at risk for developing AKI.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and current tachycardia and PVCs increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent use of immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Wound complications: The patient's stage II sacral/buttock decubitus ulcer increases the risk of wound complications, such as infection or delayed healing.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3957**] is a 74 year old male with a history of ulcerative colitis
   now on prolonged immunosuppressive  therapy, coronary artery disease
   and non-small cell lung cancer s/p VATs and left upper lobectomy in
   [**2146-11-4**] who is transferred to the ICU for increasing oxygen
   requirements and tacypnea. Course complicated by DVT and BRBPR.
   Ulcerative Colitis c/b BRBPR/hematochezia: On Chronic immunosuppression
   without releif (now tapering per GI as it isn
t working).  - GI surgery
   following as patient likely needs colectomy but is not a surgical
   candidate now.
   - Continue to hold heparing gtt
   - Q8 Hct checks
   - Active T&S, 2 large bore PIVs
   - GI following
 consider sigmoidisocopy
   - continue TPN
   Hypotension: Likely [**2-12**] Hypovolemia in setting of GIB, but could also
   be [**2-12**] adrenal insufficiency.. Off levophed since 1400 [**12-11**]
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - Bolus NS prn
   ARDS: Patient now met ARDS criteria with PO2/FiO2 of 110. ? [**2-12**]
   aspiration pna.  Intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Has been
   treated with vanc/zosyn
 no atypical coverage. More compliant with
   ventilator since on Pressure control ventilation, but remains somewhat
   hypoxic. PEEP increased from 7 to 10 in am.  Given bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR and long standing steroid use, there is some concern
   for PCP as well.  Sputum growing Aspergillus from [**12-11**]. Bronhoscopy
   performed [**12-13**] and crimson fluid sent to lab.
   - Continue PS ventilation for goal TV 6 cc/kg with goal to increase
   vent synchronization
   - f/u BAL micro data
   - LR for boluses in setting of metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
   - Continue vanc/Zosyn (started [**2146-12-7**]) for HAP/Aspiration PNA and
   Levofloxacin ([**12-10**]). Continue Caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from
   sputum [**12-11**]
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine Cxs
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium for known emphysema
   Anion-gap acidosis: Unclear etiology as gas last PM with normal
   lactate.  U/A 2 d.ago without ketones. Acidosis now resolving.
   - follow lactate
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 7**]
   DVT: Left femoral vein DVT and had been on coumadin. Now s/p IVC
   filter.
   - continue to hold coumadin
   - Heparin replaced by Argatroban for ? HIT (antibody pending)
   - if persistent bleeding consider IVC filter
   Thrombocytopenia: likely related to infection, but may be HIT. Using
   Argatrobam for now.
   - f/u HIT panel
   - transfuse if less than 10
   NSCLC s/p resection/Hydropneumothorax:  Stable.  Appreciate throacics
   input; NTD at this time.
   - continue to monitor
   Stage II sacral/buttock decubitus:
   - continue TPN for nutrition
   - wound care
   CAD s/p MI:  frequent PVCs and tachycardia on telemetry.  Likely due to
   respiratory distress and anemia.
   - continue telemetry
   - holding aspirin
   - consider restarting beta blocker use if BP stable
   - statin held during this admission [**2-12**] low LDL, malnutrition
   Type II Diabetes:  37 units regular insulin in TPN; TID sliding scale
   Access: PICC line, PIVs
   Prophylaxis: Boots, protonix, holding heparin given gib
   FEN: D5W for maintenance given hypernatremia
   - monitor electrolytes
   - continue TPN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, tacypnea, and increasing oxygen requirements. He has a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer. He has undergone a left upper lobectomy and is on prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. The patient has developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 94 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 108/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode. He has been treated with caspofungin for Aspergillus growing from his sputum, and has been given bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 5.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 25 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Caspofungin
* Vancomycin
* Zosyn
* Albuterol
* Ipratropium
* Argatroban
* Pantoprazole
* Midazolam
* Fentanyl

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for hypovolemic shock or adrenal insufficiency.
* Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, and the etiology is unclear.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and he may be at risk for bleeding.
* DVT: The patient has developed a DVT, and he may be at risk for pulmonary embolism.
* ARDS: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and he may be at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
* PCP: The patient has been treated for Aspergillus, but he may still be at risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).
* Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and he may be at risk for hypoxic respiratory failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Continue to treat the patient's infections with antibiotics and antifungals as necessary.
* Consider adjusting the patient's medications to address his hypotension, anion-gap acidosis, and thrombocytopenia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's DVT and ARDS, and consider treating him with heparin or argatroban as necessary.
* Consider treating the patient with stress dose steroids to address his adrenal insufficiency.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medications as necessary.
* Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist or critical care specialist for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, and non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to the ICU for increasing oxygen requirements and tachypnea. He has a prolonged history of immunosuppressive therapy and has developed DVT, BRBPR, and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a PO2/FiO2 ratio of 110, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has an anion-gap acidosis, likely related to his underlying conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy and chronic lung disease, he is at high risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's underlying conditions, including ulcerative colitis and immunosuppressive therapy, make him prone to developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and chronic lung disease may lead to respiratory failure, requiring continued mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular instability, requiring close monitoring and management.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and chronic immunosuppressive therapy may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring close monitoring and management.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's history of DVT and thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, requiring close monitoring and management.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy and underlying conditions make him prone to developing infections, requiring close monitoring and management.
8. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and adrenal insufficiency may lead to hypotensive episodes, requiring close monitoring and management.
10. Code status: The patient's DNR code status may impact the management of his care, requiring careful consideration and discussion with the patient and his family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient has undergone several procedures, including trans-thoracic echo, angiography, and bronchoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 102/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is currently active. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which is not attributed to delirium. The patient has anemia, which is acute and secondary to blood loss. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and they are experiencing respiratory failure, which is acute but not attributed to ARDS.

The patient has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with decreased potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. The patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may be indicative of sepsis, which can be a life-threatening condition.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of bleeding, which can be exacerbated by the patient's anticoagulant therapy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and active ulcerative colitis may increase the risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and impaired cardiac function may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."
