   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patinet was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.
   - ASA 325mg
   - begin metoprolol 100mg TID, and titrate as tolerated
   - start 5 mg lisinopril in am if BP improves
   - while no role for revascularization following infarcted myocardium 3
   days prior, would imagine likely cardiac catherization to evaluate for
   degree of CAD.
   - will discuss with ortho ability to start plavix in conservative
   mangement of STEMI
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated
   - TTE to evaluate for post-infarction complications
   - IV lasix
   - CXR to evaluate lung fields.
   - start ACE in am if BP allows
   - cont metoprolol
   - rate control as given below
   - possible repeat TTE on [**Year (4 digits) **]
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed on [**Year (4 digits) 4140**], dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.  Currently in
   AF, and started on heparin gtt.
   - ween dilt gtt as tolerated.
   - uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated for rate control
   - continue [**Last Name (LF) 4140**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to give IV load if unable to rate

   - continue heparin gtt
   - if remains in AF by [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] c/s EP for possible cardioversion.
   As heparin started at time of onset, no need for TEE.
   - if HR remains stable w/o pauses, will d/c transvenous pacer in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, and multiple PCIs. He was transferred to the ICU from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and was started on heparin gtt. His troponin peaked at 72, and he was treated conservatively without anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.

The patient's physical examination shows a tachypnic and diaphoretic male with a distended abdomen, decreased bowel sounds, and crackles at the bases of the lungs. His vital signs include a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 104/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 251 K/uL. His troponin-T is 2.21 ng/mL, and his creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. His electrolytes show a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, sodium level of 142 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient is at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, and is being managed with medications to control his heart rate and rhythm. He is also at risk for bleeding due to his heparin therapy and is being monitored closely for any signs of bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, MI, and atrial fibrillation puts him at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
2. Bleeding: The patient's heparin therapy and recent spinal surgery increase his risk for bleeding, including intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and retroperitoneal bleeding.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's tachypnea, crackles at the bases of the lungs, and low oxygen saturation put him at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and decreased bowel sounds increase his risk for infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation, distended abdomen, and decreased bowel sounds put him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including bowel obstruction, perforation, and bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent spinal surgery and history of CAD increase his risk for neurological complications, including spinal cord injury, stroke, and seizures.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) post-operatively. He was transferred to the ICU for management of pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. He has a history of CAD and multiple PCI procedures. The patient's troponin peaked at 72, and he was treated conservatively without anticoagulation due to the risk of bleeding. He was started on heparin gtt after developing new atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition includes:

* Atrial fibrillation
* Pulmonary edema
* Acute renal failure
* Ileus
* Leukocytosis
* Anemia
* Constipation

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* LV wall rupture
	* VSD (ventricular septal defect)
	* Cardiac tamponade
	* Arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation)
2. Pulmonary complications:
	* Respiratory failure
	* Pneumonia
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	* End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding
	* Intestinal obstruction
	* Sepsis
5. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
	* Pneumonia
6. Bleeding complications:
	* Hemorrhagic shock
	* Bleeding complications from heparin therapy
7. Other complications:
	* Hypotension
	* Hypoxia
	* Hypercapnia
	* Metabolic acidosis

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is essential to prevent and manage potential complications. The plan includes:

* Continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
* Daily CXR
* Start ACE if BP allows
* Change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
* Cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
* Continue amiodarone, give second 150mg IV bolus
* Continue heparin gtt
* Diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
* Continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
* Can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
* Hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
* F/u urine cultures
* Tylenol PRN for fevers
* Encourage IS

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: to be readdressed, pt and family would like to discuss

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who underwent spinal surgery.
* He developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus.
* He is currently in the ICU with ongoing medical management.

**Current Medications:**

* Heparin sodium infusion (19 units/hour)
* Furosemide (Lasix) infusion (15 mg/hour)
* Diltiazem infusion (10 mg/hour)
* Amiodarone infusion (0.5 mg/min)
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin antibiotics
* Heparin sodium gtt (post-op)

**Current Lab Results:**

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.8%
* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 21.6 K/uL
* Platelet Count (Plt): 251 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.5 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Glucose: 142 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.21 ng/mL

1. **Infection:** The patient has developed fever, leukocytosis, and is receiving antibiotics for possible HCAP and/or spinal soft tissue infection. Close monitoring of lab results and urine cultures is necessary.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving diuretics to manage fluid overload. Close monitoring of kidney function and fluid status is necessary.
3. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's pulmonary edema is worsening, and he is receiving diuretics and oxygen therapy. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and lung function is necessary.
4. **Ileus:** The patient has developed ileus, which is likely related to his spinal surgery and post-op state. Close monitoring of bowel function and management of constipation is necessary.
5. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with anti-arrhythmic medications and cardioversion.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's hematocrit level is low, and he is receiving blood transfusions. Close monitoring of hematocrit levels and blood transfusions is necessary.
7. **Surgical Bleeding:** The patient is at risk of surgical bleeding due to his heparin therapy and spinal surgery. Close monitoring of bleeding and transfusions is necessary.

**Plan:**

1. Continue medical management of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, and AKI.
2. Monitor lab results and urine cultures for signs of infection.
3. Manage constipation and ileus with bowel regimen and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
4. Monitor anemia and bleeding risks, and consider transfusions as necessary.
5. Consider catheterization on Monday to assess coronary anatomy and function.
6. Continue pain management with IV morphine and consider alternative analgesics as necessary.

   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 97-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation (AFib) and has undergone cardioversion, which was unsuccessful. He is currently being treated with diltiazem, amiodarone, and lasix, and has been diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure (CHF), constipation, and leukocytosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C), heart rate of 80-90 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/52 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a non-rebreather mask in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and liver enzymes, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, but his creatinine level is slightly elevated.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his inability to assess certain vital signs, such as radial and digital pulses, and his skin and neurologic exams are not assessed.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, there is a risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Heart failure: The patient's acute systolic heart failure (CHF) may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decompensation and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if not treated, leading to bowel obstruction, perforation, and potential sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which could lead to further complications if not properly treated.
5. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, he may be at risk for developing pneumonia, which could further complicate his condition.
6. SBO (Small Bowel Obstruction): The patient's abdominal distension and lack of bowel movement may indicate a small bowel obstruction, which could lead to further complications if not properly treated.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should receive close monitoring and management of his condition, including:

1. Antibiotics: The patient should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections.
2. Heart failure management: The patient should receive aggressive management of his heart failure, including diuretics, vasodilators, and beta-blockers.
3. Constipation treatment: The patient should receive treatment for his constipation, including laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas.
4. Pain management: The patient should receive adequate pain management to prevent discomfort and potential complications.
5. Close monitoring: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, heart failure, and other potential complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including sepsis, heart failure, constipation, leukocytosis, pneumonia, and SBO. Close monitoring and management of his condition are crucial to preventing these complications and ensuring the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, and he is still requiring non-rebreather oxygen therapy. His CXR shows mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and small right pleural effusion, which is consistent with CHF or PNA. His ABG results indicate a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 115, which suggests that he may still have significant hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and failed cardioversion. He is currently being treated with diltiazem and heparin, but his cardiac rhythm is still unstable.
3. Post-operative ileus: The patient has had no bowel movements since admission and has abdominal distension. His KUB results show adynamic ileus with more bowel distension than expected from ileus, but radiology still considers it likely to be ileus rather than small bowel obstruction.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped significantly since surgery, and he may have a bleeding source, possibly related to his heparin therapy or surgical site.
5. Infection: The patient has a fever and is being treated with antibiotics for possible HCAP or soft tissue/osteomyelitis. His WBC count is elevated, and his UA is negative. He also has a NG tube in place, which may be a source of infection.
6. Hypovolemic shock: The patient has had significant fluid removal via diuresis, which may lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed properly.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 136, potassium level of 3.7, and magnesium level of 2.1. He is also receiving medications that may affect electrolyte levels, such as diuretics and antibiotics.
8. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.5, which is elevated. He is also receiving medications that may affect renal function, such as diuretics and antibiotics.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage pulmonary edema and hypoxemia.
2. Continue antibiotics for possible HCAP or soft tissue/osteomyelitis.
3. Monitor the patient's WBC count and fever curve to assess for signs of infection.
4. Wean the patient off non-rebreather oxygen therapy if tolerated.
5. Consider intubation if the patient becomes tachypneic or hypoxemic.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Continue to manage the patient's anemia and bleeding risk.
8. Consider catheterization to assess for DVTs or CTA.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.
10. Consider ACE inhibitor therapy if the patient's blood pressure allows.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is being treated in the CCU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/
   Tylenol and rare morphine prn.

   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed atrial fibrillation (AF) post-operatively. He was initially treated with cardioversion, but it was unsuccessful. He was continued on diltiazem and amiodarone infusions, and later switched to oral medications. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, requiring non-rebreather oxygen therapy, and has had persistent fever and leukocytosis. He has also developed abdominal distension and likely prolonged post-operative ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's persistent hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's CXR shows mild pulmonary edema, which may worsen if not adequately managed.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AF may lead to heart failure, stroke, or embolism if not adequately managed.
4. Post-Operative Ileus: The patient's prolonged post-operative ileus may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or sepsis if not managed promptly.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which may spread to other parts of the body if not treated promptly.
6. Anemia: The patient's pronounced Hct drop may indicate bleeding or anemia, which may require transfusions or other interventions.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and MI may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory failure or arrest.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's spinal surgery may increase his risk of neurological complications, such as spinal cord compression, nerve damage, or spinal abscess.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with lasix to manage hypoxia and pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC and fever curve to identify potential sources of infection.
3. Consider weaning off non-rebreather oxygen therapy if tolerated.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardiology consultation if necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's post-operative ileus with bowel regimen and consider nasogastric tube placement if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
9. Consider neurological consultation to assess the patient's spinal status and potential neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, give improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, give improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed atrial fibrillation (AF) post-operatively. He was initially treated with cardioversion, but it was unsuccessful. He was then started on diltiazem and amiodarone to control his heart rate and rhythm.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxia: The patient requires non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 93%. His CXR shows mild pulmonary edema with consolidation and small right pleural effusion, which has resolved. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a significant amount of fluid removal via diuresis, but his oxygenation has not improved significantly. This suggests that there may be underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease contributing to his hypoxia.
3. Ileus: The patient has a prolonged post-operative ileus, which is causing abdominal distension and likely contributing to his shallow breathing.
4. Fever: The patient has had two episodes of fever, which may be related to infection or stress response.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has marked leukocytosis, which may be a stress response or indication of infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped significantly, which may be due to bleeding or hemolysis.
7. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in days and has distended abdomen, which may be related to medication effect or post-operative ileus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and pulmonary edema increase his risk of developing respiratory failure, which may require intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and heart failure increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of spinal surgery and prolonged immobility increase his risk of developing pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and ileus increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel perforation or obstruction.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

1. Continued diuresis to manage pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
2. Antibiotics for possible infection, pending the results of sputum smear and blood cultures.
3. Pain management to control the patient's discomfort and reduce his risk of developing respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal care to manage the patient's ileus and constipation.
5. Cardiac monitoring to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
6. Pulmonary embolism prophylaxis to reduce the patient's risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
7. Regular reassessment of the patient's condition to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly."

   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently
   Lasix 15mg/hr, Dilt 10mg/hr and d/ced amio drip this AM
   Pt. denies SOB, CP, LBP, has had two watery BMs and is passing gas.
   Pt. required K and Phos replacement o/n.  Pain well controlled w/

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on o/n
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last

   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI following surgery. He was transferred to the ICU due to pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. He continues to require non-rebreather oxygen, and his oxygenation has not improved despite significant volume removal via diuresis. He has a history of CAD and MI, and has had multiple PCIs with stents placed in the LAD. He developed chest pain following surgery, with prominent anterior ST elevations consistent with mid-LAD MI, and was managed conservatively. He was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require non-rebreather oxygen, and his oxygenation has not improved despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and has developed atrial fibrillation following surgery. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as LV wall rupture or VSD.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, which is a common complication in patients with CHF or PNA.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which is a common complication in patients with sepsis or cardiac failure.
5. Ileus: The patient has developed ileus, which is a common complication in patients with abdominal surgery or sepsis.
6. Infection: The patient has developed leukocytosis and fever, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
7. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which may be due to surgical bleeding or IVF.
8. Constipation: The patient has developed constipation, which may be due to medication effect or post-op state with ileus.
9. Spinal Complications: The patient has undergone spinal surgery, and may be at risk for spinal complications such as infection or hematoma.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. The patient requires continued diuresis with Lasix, and antibiotics for coverage of HCAP. The patient's cardiac status requires close monitoring, and consideration should be given to catheterization today. The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring, and consideration should be given to intubation if necessary. The patient's ileus requires management with lactulose and enemas, and the patient's anemia requires serial HCT. The patient's constipation requires management with colace and senna. The patient's spinal surgery requires close monitoring for complications, and the patient's code status should be readdressed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF and ileus.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD.  The patient was treated conservatively, and was not
   anticoagulated due to risk of bleeding in the post-operative period.
   The patient's troponin's peaked at 72.  He remained chest pain free
   after his intial event.  The patient was begun on heparin gtt after
   developing new AF.  He continues to be chest pain free.  No signs or
   symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath on Monday per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - change Metoprolol to Diltiazem given afib and hypotension, worsening
   pulmonary edema
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam, with distended neck veins,
   low O2 sats, and crackles on lung exam with low SBP.  O2 requirements
   increasing likely c/w worsening pulmonary edema.
   - continue Lasix gtt with Diovan to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - daily CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows
   - change Metoprolol to Dilt gtt for HR control
   - cardioversion today to improve atrial kick and HR to augment CO
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Currently in AF, and started on heparin gtt.  Given Metoprolol last
   night with HR 100s-110s.
   - continue amioderone, give second 150mg IV bolus
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt, stop Metoprolol as per above
   - continue amio gtt, electrical cardioversion today
   - can d/c transvenous pacer as pt not been bradycardic
   .
   #  Leukocytosis:  Marked leukocytosis following surgery.  Likely stress
   response.  Has developed fever in post-op/post-MI setting even w/ RTC
   tylenol.  No bandemia.  UA does not show UTI.  CXR without clear
   infiltrate.
   - hold antibiotics until pt spikes here or evidence of infection
   - f/u urine cultures
   - Tylenol PRN for fevers
   - encourage IS
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Constipation:  No BM in days with distended abdomen on morphine
   PCA.  Like secondary to medication effect and post-op state with
   ileus.  KUB consistent with stool in colon.
   - colace
   - senna
   - lactulose
   - soap suds enema
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Ortho to evaluate for post-op needs.
   - IV morphine PRN
   - d/c RTC tylenol to trend fever curve.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with IV morphine
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt. underwent cardioversion for Afib, unsuccessful.  Was thus continued
   on diltiazem gtt increased to 10mg/hr with HR now in 80-90s, SBPs >
   100.  He continued to be on amiodarone at 0.5mg/min and received 150 IV
   in AM.  Pt. spiked to 100.4F oral he was panCx in early afternoon.
   Lasix drip was continued, he received chlorothiazide 250mg x2
   throughout the day, UOP was maintained > 100cc/hr.   Spiked again
   in evening to [**Age over 90 1287**]F rectal and 100.6F oral on Tylenol, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and/or possible spinal soft tissue inf or
   osteo.  CXR showed mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and smal R pl
   effusion now resolved.  His JP came out early in afternoon, per Ortho,
   NTD.  Pt. has abdominal distension and likely prolonged post op ileus.
    He received 2 water enemas w/o effect, KUB repeat showed adynamic
   ileus w/ more bowel distension that expected from ileus, but per
   radiology still its likely ileus and not SBO.  NGT was placed, and put
   out over 800cc by MN.  Enema'swere d/ced as was lactulose.   Code
   status was addressed and patient is FULL CODE.  Midnight lytes were Na
   136, K 3.7, Mg 2.1, Cr 1.5.  Pt. had two watery stools o/n.  Currently

The patient's troponin levels peaked at 72, and he remained chest pain-free after the initial event.

The patient's current condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, ARF, and ileus. He is receiving treatment for these conditions, including Lasix, Diltiazem, and amiodarone, as well as antibiotics for possible HCAP and/or spinal soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 21.6
* Hct: 30.7
* Plt: 251
* Cr: 1.5
* TropT: 2.21
* TCO2: 28
* Glucose: 154
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.6/66.6/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 556/7/2.21, ALT/AST: 38/78, Alk Phos/T Bili: 52/0.7, Differential-Neuts: 87.7%, Lymph: 7.1%, Mono: 4.8%, Eos: 0.3%, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, LDH: 826 IU/L, Ca++: 9.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: WDWN male, on non-rebreather, comfortable, and in NAD.
* HEENT: NCAT, sclera anicteric, PERRL, EOMI, conjunctiva pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing spinal surgery. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. He is also febrile, with a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), and has a decreased bowel movement.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.9°C (102°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 21.6 K/μL
* Platelet count: 35 K/μL

The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI and multiple PCIs, and has been diagnosed with CHF, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. He is currently being treated with heparin, vancomycin, and Zosyn, and is also receiving diuretic therapy with Lasix.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of CAD and MI, as well as his current diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of PE.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which may help to prevent DVT, but there is still a risk of DVT developing.
3. Sepsis: The patient is febrile and has a decreased bowel movement, which may indicate sepsis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function or developing chronic kidney disease.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued diuretic therapy with Lasix, as well as treatment with heparin, vancomycin, and Zosyn. The patient will also be monitored for signs of sepsis and cardiac arrhythmias, and will receive aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, and lactulose PRN."

   Chief Complaint:
   68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from NEBH after a
   STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib with
   continued hypoxia.
   24 Hour Events:
   The lasix gtt was decreased to 5 mg/hr with a goal of 50-70 cc UOP/hr
   (1.5 L/ 24 h neg).  BNP was added onto his admission labs and was
   15,279.  His cordis was pulled.  His dilt gtt was decreased from 7.5 to
   5 given some low SBPs, rate remained controlled initally, however his
   HR started to creep up so it was increased back to 7.5 .  He was
   okay'ed by orhto from [**Hospital **] hospital (where he had his recent
   surgery) to get OOB.   Lower extrem US were checked given his continued
   hypoxia and were negative for DVT.  Plan is for cath on Wednesday -
   will need to have acetylcysteine written for t/m.  The patient spiked
   fevers throughout the day and was cultured.  Will need to call ortho
   here t/m am to have them come and evaluate his back as a possible
   source of infection.  His dilt drip was increased to 10 to 12.5 to
   15 as his HR began increasing to the 100s -110s.  He remained
   persistently febrile on tylenol (tmax 102.0) so his tachycardia may be
   due to his fever.  The patient had liquid brown stool this am.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid

   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today

   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from NEBH after a
   STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib with
   continued hypoxia.
   24 Hour Events:
   The lasix gtt was decreased to 5 mg/hr with a goal of 50-70 cc UOP/hr
   (1.5 L/ 24 h neg).  BNP was added onto his admission labs and was
   15,279.  His cordis was pulled.  His dilt gtt was decreased from 7.5 to
   5 given some low SBPs, rate remained controlled initally, however his
   HR started to creep up so it was increased back to 7.5 .  He was
   okay'ed by orhto from [**Hospital **] hospital (where he had his recent
   surgery) to get OOB.   Lower extrem US were checked given his continued
   hypoxia and were negative for DVT.  Plan is for cath on Wednesday -
   will need to have acetylcysteine written for t/m.  The patient spiked
   fevers throughout the day and was cultured.  Will need to call ortho
   here t/m am to have them come and evaluate his back as a possible
   source of infection.  His dilt drip was increased to 10 to 12.5 to
   15 as his HR began increasing to the 100s -110s.  He remained
   persistently febrile on tylenol (tmax 102.0) so his tachycardia may be
   due to his fever.  The patient had liquid brown stool this am.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Hypoxia.  Pt. continues to require non-rebreather, RR consistently in
   20-24.  Pt. is approx 4.3L negative o/n with minimal improvement in
   oxygenation, 92-95%.  CXR yesterday w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation
   and R pl effusion resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Due
   to fever o/n and continued O2 requirement, continued WBC, started on
   Vanco/Zosyn for coverage of HCAP (also possible soft tissue
   infection/osteomyelitis given recent spinal surgery).  WBC actually
   decreased o/n.  U/A was negative, and BCx and UCx are pending.  Unclear
   whether pt has had a PE, VQ scan will be low yield give already present
   VQ anl in setting of CHF and possible PNA.  Aa gradient is remarkable
   likely [**3-15**] physiological shunt.   Not consistent w/ hypoventilation
   given MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but abdominal distension could be contributing w/
   resultant shallow breaths.
   -          Continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt
   -          Continue ABx for now, repeat sputum smear Cx and f/u prior
   BCx
   -          Consider LENI to assess for DVTs  or CTA w/ pretreatment if
   continued O2 demand.
   -          Consider weaning off NRB today if tolerated
   -          Low threshold for intubation, should patient become
   tachypneic (> 30) and w/ worsening hypoxemia or unable to protect
   airway
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine), line infection, pt has cordis in
   place, transvenous pacer pulled.  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.
   -          Monitor WBC/fever curve, Tylenol prn for fevers
   -          Will discuss pulling line w/ attending, if so, will pull and
   Cx.
   -          CIS, f/u Cx
   -          Serial back exams daily
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - consider cath Today per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 161**] recommendations, although unclear
   benefit after 3 days post- STEMI
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but much improved from
   yesterday and R predominant pulmonary crackles atypical for CHF.  CXR
   from yesterday consistent w/ CHF, today
s is pending.  He is hypoxic
   c/w worsening pulmonary edema or PNA, but is 3.4L negative [**3-15**] diuresis
   and emesis o/n.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does
   not have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - f/u CXR
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - d/ced Amiodarone, given improvement w/ diltiazem
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  JP also putting out some drainage
   - serial HCT
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Pt. w/ 2 watery BMs o/n,
   improving.  NPO for possible cath for now, will discuss w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   - colace
   - senna
   - no enema
s given no stool in colon.
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   .
   FEN:  NPO for cardioversion and ileus
   ACCESS: PIV's  , will d/c cordis today.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU for now given hypoxia.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has atrial fibrillation, continued hypoxia, and is receiving non-rebreather oxygen therapy. He has a history of CAD, with prior MI and multiple PCIs, and has developed new AF. He is receiving heparin and Diltiazem for HR control and improved filling. He has a history of pulmonary edema, CHF, and ARF, and is receiving diuresis with Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's continued hypoxia may be due to pulmonary edema, CHF, or PNA. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and possible weaning off NRB today if tolerated.
2. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's source of fever is unclear, but possible causes include PNA, UTI, soft tissue/osteomyelitis, or post-op stress response. Monitoring of WBC/fever curve and Tylenol prn for fevers.
3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of CAD and has developed new AF. He is receiving heparin and Diltiazem for HR control and improved filling.
4. PUMP: The patient's EF is 40% with apical and septal HK, and he appears to be in failure on exam. Monitoring of Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour.
5. Rhythm: The patient has developed AF and is receiving Diltiazem for HR control and improved filling.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct drop may be due to IVF or surgical bleed. Monitoring of serial HCT.
7. Post-op ileus: The patient has no BM in on admission and has a distended abdomen. Monitoring of bowel regimen and possible cath for now.
8. Spinal surgery: The patient has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated, and is to be evaluated by ortho for post-op needs.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt.

   1. Mild pulmonary edema.
   2. Bilateral atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
   3. Layering sludge within the gallbladder.
   4. Calcified pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with a diagnosis of STEMI following spinal surgery. He has a history of CAD and MI. The patient's course has been complicated by pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, ileus, and continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 120/91 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula at 4 L.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, soft and mildly tense abdomen, and decreased bowel sounds. He has no signs of stasis dermatitis, cyanosis, or edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.2 K/μL, mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels. His creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 3.3 mEq/L.

The patient's chest CT scan shows mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and small left pleural effusion. The scan also reveals layering sludge within the gallbladder and calcified pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, acute respiratory failure, and anemia. He is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of CAD and MI, pneumonia is a concern, especially with the presence of bilateral atelectasis and small left pleural effusion on the chest CT scan.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral atelectasis on the chest CT scan increase the risk of developing ARDS.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of CAD and MI increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of spinal surgery increase the risk of infection, particularly in the surgical site.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of CAD and MI increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of CAD and MI and the presence of bilateral atelectasis on the chest CT scan increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

In conclusion, the patient's health progress in the ICU is stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his conditions are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Source include PNA (HCAP, aspiration given
   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   emesis and NGT placement), UTI
 unlikely given UA, soft tissue/osteo
   given recent spinal surgery and hardware (exam not consistent w/ active
   infection and no TTP along spine).  Finally possibly post op stress
   response.  Other etiologies of fever include occult infections
   (endocarditis, spinal abscess, abdominal infection), non-infectious
   causes such as PE/DVT, central fevers.  Pt is already being treated
   with heparin for PE, LENIs negative for DVT.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals
   - check urine legionella, r/o influenza with nasal aspirate
   - check LFTs, amylase, lipase
   # Hypoxia.  CXR w/ mild pulm edema w/ consolidation and R pl effusion
   resolved from [**1-17**].  DDx includes CHF, PNA, PE.  Also may be secondary
   to abdominal distention and compression on lungs.  Positional nature of
   hypoxia consistent with effusions.  LENIs negative although PE is still
   in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt, goal negative 1 L today
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   - f/u sputum cultures
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has a history of CAD, with prior MI, and
   multiple PCIs, with 2 stents placed in [**2192**].  The patient with chest
   pain following surgery, with prominant aterior ST elevations c/w mid
   LAD, Tx conservatively, and was not anticoagulated due to risk of
   bleeding in the post-operative period.  The patient's troponin's peaked
   at 72.  He remained chest pain free after his intial event.  The
   patient was begun on heparin gtt after developing new AF.  He continues
   to be chest pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or
   VSD.  No new murmurs
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Continue Diltiazem given afib (holding BBk due to previous
   hypotension)
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Patient appears to be in failure on exam today, but lung exam is
   improving.  Pt. failed cardioversion yesterday, thus still does not
   have the benefit of atrial kick.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Pt on  Dilt gtt for HR control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion yesterday, completed Amiodarone loading IV bolus
   and drips, benefit of this is unclear, as pt improved w/ dilt only.
   Currently in AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not
   brady, transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to clears
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Ortho
   to evaluate for post-op needs.  No signs of infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - f/u ortho recs

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, and multiple PCIs, who was transferred to the ICU after developing pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus following spinal surgery. He was diagnosed with a STEMI and treated with heparin, Lasix, and Zosyn. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, diuresis, and has a nasogastric tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's fever may be due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, soft tissue or osteomyelitis, or post-operative stress response. Cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or abdominal distention and compression on the lungs. He is being treated with diuresis and oxygen therapy.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and is at risk for further cardiac complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be due to post-operative stress, and he is being treated with heparin and Diltiazem.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to blood loss during surgery or IVF. He is being monitored closely.
6. Post-operative Ileus: The patient's ileus may be due to surgical trauma, and he is being treated with aggressive bowel regimen and diet advancement.
7. Spinal Surgery Complications: The patient may be at risk for spinal surgery complications such as infection, hardware failure, or nerve damage. He is being monitored closely by the orthopedic team.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. He is being treated with antibiotics, diuresis, and oxygen therapy, and his cardiac condition is being closely monitored. The patient's anemia and ileus are being managed with blood transfusions and bowel regimen, respectively. The orthopedic team is monitoring the patient's spinal surgery site for any signs of infection or complications. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to the CCU."

   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o
   MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they were less
   concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl, no
   replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.

   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor

   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF,  ileus and continued
   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   .
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after undergoing spinal surgery and developing pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. He has been receiving diuresis with Lasix and diuril, antibiotics, and other medications to manage his condition.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 73-150 bpm
* Blood pressure: 116/59 mmHg with a range of 71-134/69-82 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (IPM) with a range of 14-27 IPM
* SpO2: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium: 133 mmol/L, potassium: 3.5 mmol/L, chloride: 95 mmol/L
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, MI, and spinal surgery. He has developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus, and is receiving treatment for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing sepsis due to his underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and is at risk for developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal complications: The patient has developed acute renal failure, and is at risk for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has developed ileus, and is at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and hemorrhage.
6. Spinal complications: The patient has undergone spinal surgery, and is at risk for developing spinal complications such as infection, hematoma, and spinal cord injury.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient has developed pulmonary edema, and is at risk for developing respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications and to improve the patient's outcomes."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Discussed with Dow, he may
   undergo cardioversion on cath lab tomorrow, pt is NPO.  Infectious w/up
   w/ negative influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and
   catheter tip Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior
   to cath.  O2 weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho
   felt ok w/o MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they
   were less concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl,
   no replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

   hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBCs 19.2.  From prior
   records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Chest CT today to assess for PNA vs. pulmonary edema
   - Serial back exams daily
   - will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation
   - continue Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]), add Levofloxacin
   (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) to cover atypicals.  Will continue broad-spectrum
   abxs for now and consider narrowing tomorrow
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - no plans for cath at this point, now 5 days post-event would have
   little benefit
   - Change Diltiazem to PO and stop gtt.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   - plan for cath tomorrow to assess coronaries, NPO after midnight
   .
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - continue Lasix gtt with chlorothiazide to maintain uop > 100/hour
   - start ACE if BP allows (SBP > 110mmHg)
   - Diltiazem for rate control and improved filling
   .
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Currently in
   AF w/ slow VR.  He is on heparin gtt.   Since pt. was not brady,
   transvenous pacer was d/ced.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.
   .
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #  Post op ileus:  No BM in on admission with distended abdomen on
   morphine PCA.  NPO, NGT in place with marked output o/n.  KUB
   consistent with ileus, no stool in colon.  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   - advance diet to soft
   .
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Discussed with Dow, he may
   undergo cardioversion on cath lab tomorrow, pt is NPO.  Infectious w/up
   w/ negative influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and
   catheter tip Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior
   to cath.  O2 weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho
   felt ok w/o MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they
   were less concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl,
   no replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) who was transferred from another hospital after undergoing spinal surgery. He developed pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (ARF), and ileus, which complicated his post-operative course.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm) with atrial fibrillation
* Blood pressure: 116/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Weight: 97.4 kg (admission: 103.3 kg)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.9%
* Platelet count: 459 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 133 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mmol/L, chloride 95 mmol/L
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Coronary artery disease (CAD)
* Myocardial infarction (MI)
* Atrial fibrillation
* Acute kidney injury (ARF)
* Ileus
* Hypoxia
* Anemia

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin 325 mg
* Plavix
* Heparin gtt
* Vancomycin
* Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam)
* Levofloxacin
* Diltiazem
* Lasix (furosemide)
* Chlorothiazide
* Metoprolol
* Amiodarone

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan shows small bilateral pulmonary effusions and atelectasis, which may be indicative of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate the presence of an infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of MI may increase his risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's ARF may worsen if he continues to have decreased urine output.
5. Ileus: The patient's post-operative ileus may persist, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if he continues to have decreased oxygen saturation.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to have bleeding or decreased red blood cell production.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring and management of his medications, fluids, and laboratory results are essential to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Chest CT final read w/ small bilateral effusions, atelectasis, mild
   congestion.  Pt. afebrile, was net negative, but only ~ 500cc on lasix
   gtt.  Was changed to PO diltiazem from gtt and eventually had aflutter
   w/ HR in 150s.  Received IV dilt 10mg x3, PO increased to 60mg with
   poor response.  Restarted on Diltiazem gtt @ 2000with HR down to 80-90
   by 2300 and SBPs > 110, HR 70-80s o/n.  Infectious w/up w/ negative
   influenza nasal wash, negative legionella and UCx and catheter tip
   Cx. PT saw pt, ambulated in room, will see him in AM prior to cath.  O2
   weaned off, but restarted while pt was in flutter.  Ortho felt ok w/o
   MRI (would get it if we were concerned re: infection), they were less
   concerned re: infection in spine, OK OOB.  PM lytes were wnl, no
   replacement.  Cr climbing back up, sent UA repeat w/ Lytes.
   This am the patient denies CP, SOB, or change in his back pain.  Had
   two loose bowel movements yesterday.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of CAD, MI, and recent spinal surgery. He developed atrial fibrillation (AF) post-STEMI and was treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and rate control medications. He had a chest CT showing mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions. His laboratory results showed leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and hypokalemia. He also had an episode of tachycardia with a heart rate of 150s, which was managed with IV diltiazem.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to embolic events, such as stroke or peripheral embolism.
	* Tachycardia may cause hypotension, leading to organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia is a concern given the patient's history of respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral atelectasis.
	* Atelectasis may lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure (ARF) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed promptly.
	* Elevated creatinine levels may indicate prerenal, postrenal, or intrinsic renal disease.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Postoperative ileus may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding is a concern given the patient's history of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Infection:
	* The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response.
	* The presence of pleural effusions and atelectasis suggests possible infection.
6. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* The patient's recent MI and AF may lead to cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
	* The patient's history of CAD and MI may increase the risk of future cardiac events.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medications as necessary to maintain rate control.
2. Perform a thorough evaluation of the patient's respiratory status, including chest x-rays and arterial blood gases.
3. Manage the patient's fluid balance and electrolytes carefully to prevent further worsening of ARF.
4. Consider starting an ACE inhibitor to help manage the patient's blood pressure and cardiac function.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust bowel regimens as necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust antibiotics as necessary to prevent further infection.
7. Consider performing a renal ultrasound to evaluate the patient's renal function and rule out postrenal obstruction."

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   Cath yesterday showed high grade mid-LAD 90% lesion with thrombus, got
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarb prior to
   procedure, Creat post-procedure was 2.6.
   At 10pm, HR increased to 100s, 110s.  Was given
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, and hypoxia. He underwent a catheterization procedure, which showed a high-grade mid-LAD lesion with thrombus, and was stented with a DES. He has been receiving various medications, including anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to 2.2, indicating ARF. The cause is unclear, but possible causes include prerenal, ATN, AIN, or postrenal causes.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been experiencing pulmonary edema, which is likely related to his atrial fibrillation and CHF.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, which is likely related to his pulmonary edema and atelectasis.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is likely related to his post-MI state.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone a STEMI, which may increase his risk of future cardiac events.
6. Post-Operative Ileus: The patient has been experiencing post-operative ileus, which may be related to his spinal surgery.
7. Anemia: The patient has a pronounced Hct drop, which may be related to his IVF or surgical bleed.
8. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fever, which may be related to a septic process.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to treat the patient's atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants and rate control medications.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pulmonary edema with diuretics and oxygen therapy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly.
5. Consider starting an ACE inhibitor once the patient's ARF is resolved.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's Hct level and adjust his blood transfusions accordingly.
7. Consider starting an anticoagulant to prevent further thrombotic events.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's bowel movements and adjust his bowel regimen accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   Cath yesterday showed high grade mid-LAD 90% lesion with thrombus, got
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Was given N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarb prior to
   procedure, Creat post-procedure was 2.6.
   At 10pm, HR increased to the 100s-110s and pt was given 30mg PO
   Diltiazem (was still on Dilt gtt 5mg/hr).  Became hypoxic to the
   mid-80s on 50% facemask.  Got 40mg IV Lasix, CXR showed worsened
   pulmonary edema.  Got Albuterol and Atroven nebs.  ABG was
   7.5/37/84/30.  HR was in the 120s to 130s and Diltiazem gtt increased
   to 15mg/hr for rate control.  Given additional 30mg PO Dilt and 25mg
   Metoprolol and standing doses increased.  Got 10mg IV Dilt X 2.  Pt was

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and persistent hypoxia, which was treated with diuresis and catheterization with a DES to the mid-LAD. The patient's condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, ARF, ileus, and continued hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and AF with RVR. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, but the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 88, indicating hypoxemia.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and MI, and the recent STEMI has resulted in a mid-LAD thrombus. The patient is at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as LV wall rupture or VSD.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient developed AF in the post-MI setting, which is a risk factor for further cardiovascular complications. The patient's heart rate is currently controlled with Diltiazem and Metoprolol, but the patient's AF is difficult to transition to PO Dilt.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine is rising, and the patient has urine lytes consistent with pre-renal failure. The patient is at risk for further kidney damage from contrast-induced nephropathy.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is dropping, which may be due to IVF or surgical bleeding. The patient is at risk for further anemia and potential bleeding complications.
6. Post-Op Ileus: The patient has intermittent bowel movements, which may indicate a prolonged ileus. The patient is at risk for further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Spinal Surgery Complications: The patient has no restrictions for the spinal surgery, but the patient is at risk for post-op infection or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage pulmonary edema and ARF.
2. Monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm closely, and adjust medication as needed to control AF.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust medication as needed to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust medication as needed to prevent further anemia and bleeding complications.
5. Continue bowel regimen to manage post-op ileus and prevent further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's spinal surgery site for signs of infection or other complications.
7. Consider ACE inhibitor therapy when the patient's BP is stable and the patient's kidney function is improving."

   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transfered
   from NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery in persistent a.fib
   with continued hypoxia now s/p cath with a DES to the mid-LAD
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's Cr rose to 2.2 this am, 2.4 on recheck (from 1.3).  He
   went to cath where he was found to have single vessel disease of the
   LAD with a mid vessel high grade 90% lesion with thrombus which was
   stented with a Xience 3x18mm stent.  Also moderate biventricular
   diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension were
   noted.  Urinary eosinophils were checked and returned positvie with
   rare eosinophils seen.  His FEurea returned at 19.3% which suggests a
   prerenal etiology.  He was given acetylcysteine and IVF with bicarb pre
   and post procedure for renal protection.  A post cath Cr returned at
   2.6.  His vanc and zosyn were stopped as he has been afebrile; he was
   continued on levofloxacin.  His post cath check was normal.  Around 10
   pm his HR started increasing to the 100's to 110's. He was given an
   extra 30 mg of po dilt (was still on 5 mg/hr IV dilt gtt at the time
   and had gotten his po metoprolol 2 hrs prior).  He then started to have
   hypoxia to the mid 80's even on 50% facemask.  His post cath IVF were
   stopped and he was given 40 mg IV lasix.  He was wheezy on exam so he
   was given albuterol and atrovent.  An ABG showed 7.50/37/84/30 (likely
   metabolic alkalosis from bicarb drip).  A CXR showed some mild increase
   in fluid in his lungs, but no infiltrate.  His sats then improved to
   the mid to high 90's.  His HR then persistently increased to the 100's
   sometimes increasing to the 120's to 130's.  His dilt gtt was turned up
   at intervals eventually to 15 mg/hr.  He was given another 30 mg of
   dilt and then 25 mg of metoprolol.  (and his normal doses were
   increased to dilt 60 qid and metoprolol 25 tid).  He was still high so
   10 mg IV dilt was pushed twice.  Finally his HRs decreased to the 80's
   to 90's.  Throughout this he remained asymptomatic and comfortable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   # Leukocytosis/Fever.  Now afebrile with WBC stable at 19.2.  From
   prior records, WBC has been elevated in the past.  No clear signs of
   pneumonia per CXR; however pt has now improved on antibiotics and has
   been in hospital setting.  Sputum X 2 with oropharnygeal
   contamination.  Chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral
   atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion as well as calcified
   pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - Serial back exams daily
   - Will hold on MRI for now given low likelihood of post-op surgical
   infection so soon after operation.  Ortho agrees that an MRI is not
   necessary at this time.
   - Will DC Vancomycin and Zosyn (day #1 = [**2195-1-19**]) as there is no
   clinical evidence of infection requiring board-spectrum coverage.
   - Continue Levofloxacin (day #1 = [**2195-1-20**]) as he became afebrile once
   the levofloxacin was added.
   .  # RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt yesterday and the dilt gtt
   was stopped and he was switched to po dilt, however he developed a
   flutter with HRs in the 150s unresponseive to 10 mg IV dilt x3 and
   increased dosing of po dilt.  Was eventually placed back on a dilt gtt
   with control of his rate.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - diltiazem gtt titrate to HR =<80s, and SBP > 100 mmHg.   Will
   gradually add po dilt and slowly wean off the dilt gtt.  Also getting
   po metoprolol.
   # Hypoxia.  Chest CT does not show focal consolidation, however patient
   has been coughing and improved with antibiotics.  Likely some
   atelectasis with small bilateral pulmonary effusions per CT.
   .  LENIs negative although PE is still in differential.
   - continue diuresis w/ lasix gtt and diuril as necessary
   - continue Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levo as per above
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Cath today.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg tid.
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with a Cr rise to 2.2 from a baseline of
   1.3 to 1.6.  Unclear cause, possibly due to slight hypotension during
   the episode of tachycardia yesterday.  Differential includes prerenal
   vs ATN vs AIN (given recent antibiotics), vs postrenal.  Vanc level was
   elevated at 22.3, but this is unlikely to have caused such a large
   increase in Cr.
   -  Will given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine given dye at cath
   -  Trend Cr
   -  Check urinary electrolytes and urinary eosinophils
   -  Place foley to check for urinary retension and consider a renal US
   if his Cr continues to worsen.
   -  Hold diuresis for now.
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - Lasix gtt stopped given ARF
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Patient had two loose bowel movements overnight.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  clears

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent spinal surgery and developed a STEMI post-operatively. He was transferred to the ICU with persistent atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent catheterization and was found to have single-vessel disease in the mid-LAD, which was stented with a DES. He was also diagnosed with moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The patient's Cr rose to 2.2, and he was given IVF with bicarb and acetylcysteine to protect his kidneys. He was also given lasix and diuril to manage his fluid balance. His heart rate increased to the 100s, and he was given extra doses of diltiazem and metoprolol to control his rate. He was also given albuterol and atrovent to manage his wheezing.

The patient's lab results showed a WBC of 19.2, Hct of 29.6, and Cr of 2.4. His electrolyte levels were normal, and his liver function tests were within normal limits. His chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and a small left pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
	* The patient's EF is 40%, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction.
2. Renal complications:
	* The patient's Cr rose to 2.2, indicating acute renal failure.
	* The patient may be at risk for further kidney damage or progression to chronic kidney disease.
3. Pulmonary complications:
	* The patient's hypoxia and wheezing may indicate respiratory distress or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
	* The patient's chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and a small left pleural effusion, which may indicate pulmonary congestion or pneumonia.
4. Infection:
	* The patient's WBC is elevated, and he has been given antibiotics for possible infection.
	* The patient's chest CT showed mild pulmonary edema, bilateral atelectasis, and a small left pleural effusion, which may indicate pneumonia or other infection.
5. Bleeding:
	* The patient is on heparin and may be at risk for bleeding complications.
	* The patient's Hct is 29.6, which may indicate anemia or bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, pulmonary complications, infection, and bleeding. Close monitoring and management of these complications are necessary to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and IV morphine prn
   -Bowel regimen as listed above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].
   # Hypoxia.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting of IVF and afib
   with RVR.  Responded to 40mg IV Lasix last night.
   - additional 40mg IV lasix this morning
   - will re-evaluate and diurese more if necessary for goal -1L today
   - PM lytes
   - HR control with Diltiazem 90mg PO QID (increased) and Metoprolol 25mg
   TID
   - Vanc and Zosyn stopped yesterday, will continue Levoquin for 5 day
   course (today is day [**5-17**])
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Integrilin for 18 hours post-stent
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - consider ACE when tolerated by BP
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt.
   - will increase Dilt to 90mg PO QID and attempt to wean Dilt gtt
   - increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and start Coumadin today for anticoagulation
   # PUMP:  Echo at NEBH shows EF of 40% with apical and septal HK.
   Appears to be in failure and has benefited symptomatically from
   diuresis.
   - diurese today with PRN Lasix for goal of -1L
   - Consider starting an acei once ARF is resolved.
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now rising with urine lytes
   consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Expecting a rise in the next few days due to ATN from contrast.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT stable at 30.9 today.
   - continue to monitor
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.
   - IV morphine PRN and Tylenol RTC, given now that he has been Cx.
   - ortho now signed off
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of CAD and MI who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department after a STEMI following spinal surgery. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and ileus. He has been treated with diuretics, anticoagulation therapy, and rate control medications. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 104/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His laboratory results show a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL, and a potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen due to continued fluid overload, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is rising, and his BUN level is high, indicating potential acute kidney injury. This could lead to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
4. Infection: The patient has a spinal surgery site that may be at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and death.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ileus may worsen, leading to bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which could lead to anemia and fatigue.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium level is high, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuretic therapy to manage pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine and BUN levels closely to assess for acute kidney injury.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider cardioversion if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's spinal surgery site for signs of infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's bowel movements and consider further treatment for ileus if necessary.
7. Consider transfusing blood products to manage anemia.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider further treatment if necessary."

   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - Will start  ACE when tolerated by BP and Cr. improves.
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt, successfully transitioned yesterday w/ 90mg QID,
   gtt off since 5pm.
   - Continue Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
   - Continue Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and Coumadin, d/c heparin once INR > 2.0 x 24hrs
   # PUMP:  Echo here w/ LVEF 35-40%, mild symmetric LVH w/ regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild MR.  On exam much improved from
   yesterday, trace LE edema.  Has runs of NSVT on Tele.
   - diurese today with Lasix for goal of -0.5L
   - Will start  ACEI once ARF is improved and BPs tolerate (mean SBP >
   110).
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   - Pt. will require ECHO within 6-8wks as OP and ECG to assess for need
   of an ICD, as currently w/ runs of NSVT.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable, UOP > 50cc/hr and  urine
   lytes consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Will monitor for CIN as pt. received dye load in setting of elevated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 68 y/o male w/ a hx of CAD and MI who is transferred from
   NEBH after a STEMI following spinal surgery.  Course complicated by
   pulmonary edema c/w CHF, atrial fibrillation, ARF, ileus and some
   continued hypoxemia despite significant volume removal via diuresis.
   Cath with mid-LAD thrombus s/p DES [**2195-1-22**].  Now afebrile but on
   Tylenol and stable WBC count.
   # Hypoxia.  Much improved.  Likely from pulmonary edema in the setting
   of IVF in cath lab and afib with RVR.  Responded to 120mg IV Lasix
   total yesterday.  CTAB today.
   - Wean off O2
   - diurese w/ goal of -0.5L today
   - PM lytes
   - Continue Levoquin for 10 day course (today is day [**6-21**]) for HCAP.
   - f/[**Location 39**] CXR read
   # CORONARIES:  S/P STEMI post-operatively.  He continues to be chest
   pain free.  No signs or symptoms of LV wall rupture or VSD.  No new
   murmurs.  Currently in afib post-STEMI.  Cath [**2195-1-22**] showing mid-LAD
   thrombus, now s/P LAD stent.
   - ASA 325mg, Plavix, Heparin gtt
   - Metoprolol 25mg PO TID, Simvastatin
   - Will start  ACE when tolerated by BP and Cr. improves.
   .# RHYTHM:  Patient developed AF in post-MI setting, with HR of 140s,
   managed initially on amioderone, dilt gtt, and metoprolol at NEBH.
   Failed cardioversion, had been on Amiodarone and failed.  Patient had
   been in afib rate controlled with a dilt gtt and has been difficult to
   transition to PO Dilt, successfully transitioned yesterday w/ 90mg QID,
   gtt off since 5pm.
   - Continue Diltiazem 90mg PO QID
   - Continue Metoprolol to 25mg PO TID
   - continue heparin gtt and Coumadin, d/c heparin once INR > 2.0 x 24hrs
   # PUMP:  Echo here w/ LVEF 35-40%, mild symmetric LVH w/ regional
   systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and mild MR.  On exam much improved from
   yesterday, trace LE edema.  Has runs of NSVT on Tele.
   - diurese today with Lasix for goal of -0.5L
   - Will start  ACEI once ARF is improved and BPs tolerate (mean SBP >
   110).
   - Diltiazem and metoprolol as above for rate control and improved
   filling
   - Pt. will require ECHO within 6-8wks as OP and ECG to assess for need
   of an ICD, as currently w/ runs of NSVT.
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable, UOP > 50cc/hr and  urine
   lytes consistent with pre-renal via FeUrea.  Will continue to monitor.
   Will monitor for CIN as pt. received dye load in setting of elevated
   Cr.
   -  continue to monitor urine output and creatinine
   - hold nephrotoxic meds
   # Anemia:  Pronounced Hct drop in days following surgery.  Suspect may
   be [**3-15**] to IVF.  No clear bleeding, but patient on heparin post op, so
   may have surgical bleed.  HCT 27.2, mostly ranging in 28-31 since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor
   -          guiac all stools.
   #  Post op ileus:  Having intermittent bowel movements.
   - continue bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PRN
   # Spinal surgery:  Per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4167**], surgeon from [**Hospital1 **] who
   performed procedure, pt. has no restrictions, OOB as tolerated.  Has
   evaluated for post-op infection, recommended MRI if concerns for
   infection; however suspicion is low at this time.  No signs of
   infection so far.  Pt. ambulating w/ walker comfortably.
   - change Tylenol to prn to monitor for fever, given now that he has
   been Cx.
   - oxycodone 5mg q4h prn pain
   FEN:  cardiac diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone
   -Bowel regimen as listed above
   CODE: FULL code, discussed with patient and family.
   DISPO: CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
