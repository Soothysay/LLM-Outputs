   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern, coagulopathy:  RUQ shows sludge with
   possible mass, stone with some element of chronicity.  Cholangitis may
   be the source of E. coli; however, she inconsistently has RUQ
   tenderness on exam.  She has also improved dramatically in the last 5
   days despite no drainage of the biliary system.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - consider CT abdomen to further evaluate biliary system
   - ERCP fellow notified, will proceed tonight if patient decompensates,
   otherwise will have procedure tomorrow
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Source includes UTI v. cholangitis as above.
   Urine and blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent,
   zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem.  Currently hemodynamically stable
   off of pressors for 36 hours.
   - start CTX for E. coli
   - broaden back to vanc/zosyn if decompensates
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, monitor pulmonary status
   carefully with each bolus
   - restart levophed if needed, though currently hemodynamically stable
   - d/c stress dose steroids
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Pt in decompensated heart failure at OSH.  Also has history
   of COPD on multiple inhalers at home.  On exam, pt has bibasilar
   crackles.
   - obtain CXR
   .
   # MAT:  EKG here shows ST with PACs.
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed
   .
   # Volume status:  Pt aggressively fluid resuscitated in the setting of
   sepsis.  Pt is now requiring 3.5 L NC with coarse bibasilar crackles on
   exam.
   - obtain CXR
   - monitor pulmonary status after all IVF boluses as pt is [**Name (NI) 951**]
   .
   # Depressed mental status:  This is likely delirium on dementia.
   Baseline is unclear.  This is likely related to infectious process.  No
   hypercarbia on ABG.
   - treat underlying infectious process
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   - monitor mental status, low threshold to perform head CT given recent
   INR of 6.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.
   .
   # ARF:  Cr peaked at 2 at OSH, currently trending down.
   - cont. to monitor Cr
   - renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # COPD:
   - obtain CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - restart home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix
   .
   # FEN:  IVF boluses as above, monitor electrolytes, NPO except for meds
   # PPx:  pneumoboots given coagulopathy, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, ABG: pH 7.38, PaCO2 35 mmHg, PaO2 71 mmHg, BE -3 mmol/L
* Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia, no acute distress
* Neurologic: Depressed mental status, likely delirium or dementia
* Laboratory results:
	+ LFTs: Cholestatic pattern, coagulopathy
	+ Coagulation studies: PT 12.7 seconds, PTT 32.2 seconds, INR 1.1
	+ Blood cultures: Grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem
	+ Urine cultures: Grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem
* Plan:
	+ Monitor LFTs and coagulation studies
	+ Consider CT abdomen to evaluate biliary system
	+ ERCP procedure planned for tonight or tomorrow
	+ Start CTX for E. coli and broaden to vanc/zosyn if decompensates
	+ Monitor pulmonary status with IVF boluses
	+ Restart levophed if needed
	+ Discontinue stress dose steroids
	+ Monitor coagulopathy and consider vitamin K therapy
	+ Obtain CXR to evaluate for hypoxia
	+ Treat underlying infection and monitor mental status
	+ Hold neurontin for now and monitor for signs of delirium
	+ Monitor creatinine and adjust medication dosing accordingly
	+ Restart home antipsychotics and hold neurontin for now
	+ Restart insulin therapy for DM2
	+ Continue protonix for gastritis/PUD
	+ Plan for PICC line placement and removal of existing central venous line

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Cholangitis and biliary obstruction
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Hypoxia and respiratory failure
* ARF and electrolyte imbalance
* Delirium and dementia
* Cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Infection and sepsis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern, coagulopathy:  RUQ shows sludge with
   possible mass, stone with some element of chronicity.  Cholangitis may
   be the source of E. coli; however, she inconsistently has RUQ
   tenderness on exam.  She has also improved dramatically in the last 5
   days despite no drainage of the biliary system.  No evidence of
   cholangitis
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Source includes UTI v. cholangitis as above.
   Urine and blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent,
   zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem.  Currently hemodynamically stable
   off of pressors for 48 hours.
   - cont CTX for E. coli
   - broaden back to vanc/zosyn if decompensates
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, monitor pulmonary status
   carefully with each bolus
   - restart levophed if needed, though currently hemodynamically stable
   - d/c
d stress dose steroids
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # Hypoxia:  Pt in decompensated heart failure at OSH.  Also has history
   of COPD on multiple inhalers at home.  On exam, pt has bibasilar
   crackles.
   - obtain CXR
   .
   # MAT:  EKG here shows ST with PACs.
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed
   .
   # Volume status:  Pt aggressively fluid resuscitated in the setting of
   sepsis.  Pt is now requiring 3.5 L NC with coarse bibasilar crackles on
   exam.
   - obtain CXR
   - monitor pulmonary status after all IVF boluses as pt is [**Name (NI) 951**]
   .
   # Depressed mental status:  This is likely delirium on dementia.
   Baseline is unclear.  This is likely related to infectious process.  No
   hypercarbia on ABG.  Per report, this is not patient
s baseline.
   - treat underlying infectious process
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   - monitor mental status, low threshold to perform head CT given recent
   INR of 6
   -  will check ammonia level
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.
   .
   # ARF:  Cr peaked at 2 at OSH, currently trending down.
   - cont. to monitor Cr
   - renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who was admitted with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors for 48 hours. She has since improved dramatically in the last 5 days despite no drainage of the biliary system. The patient has a cholestatic pattern of liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulopathy, which is likely related to liver dysfunction. 

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed. These include:

1. Cholangitis: The patient has a RUQ mass and possible stone, which may be the source of E. coli infection. However, she has inconsistently had RUQ tenderness on exam, and no evidence of cholangitis has been found.

2. Gram-negative sepsis: The patient has a history of UTI and cholangitis, and her urine and blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to several antibiotics. She is currently being treated with CTX and is hemodynamically stable off of pressors for 48 hours.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that is likely related to liver dysfunction. Her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K, and she is being monitored for any changes.

4. Hypoxia: The patient has bibasilar crackles on exam and a history of COPD. She is being treated with IVF boluses and oxygen therapy.

5. Depressed mental status: The patient has a depressed mental status that is likely related to the infectious process. She is being treated with antibiotics and is being monitored for any changes.

6. ARF: The patient has a history of ARF, and her creatinine has peaked at 2. She is being monitored for any changes and is being treated with renally dosed medications.

7. Demand ischemia: The patient has a history of demand ischemia, and her troponin levels have trended down. She is being monitored for any changes.

8. Gastritis/PUD: The patient has a history of gastritis/PUD, and is being treated with protonix.

9. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, and is being treated with nebulizers and Advair.

10. Schizophrenia: The patient has a history of schizophrenia, and is being treated with antipsychotic medications.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for E. coli
* Monitoring LFTs and coags
* Planning for ERCP this morning
* Continuing IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60
* Monitoring pulmonary status carefully with each bolus
* Restarting levophed if needed
* Continuing to monitor coags
* Treating underlying infectious process
* Holding neurontin for now given mental status
* Monitoring mental status and considering head CT given recent INR of 6
* Continuing to monitor Cr and renally dosing medications
* Restarting home antipsychotics
* Holding neurontin for now given mental status
* Continuing insulin therapy for DM2
* Continuing protonix therapy for gastritis/PUD
* Continuing nebulizers and Advair therapy for COPD
* Restarting home antipsychotics for schizophrenia

The patient's access includes a L subclavian CVL from OSH, which needs to be removed within 24 hours, and a plan for PICC today if no PIV can be placed. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her contact is her daughter."

Summary:

The patient was admitted to the ICU for ERCP due to suspected cholestasis. They have a history of allergies, but no known drug allergies. The patient denies pain and reports no changes in their review of systems except for some respiratory issues. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/51 mmHg. They are receiving infusions and other medications in the ICU.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and mild hypercalcemia. They have a low platelet count and elevated creatinine levels. Their blood products and urine output are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, symmetric lung expansion, and crackles in the anterior chest. They have right and left lower extremity edema and are oriented to hospital time.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cholestasis: The patient's primary condition may worsen, leading to further liver damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory issues, including crackles in the anterior chest, may worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mild anemia and elevated creatinine levels may indicate underlying cardiovascular issues, which could worsen and lead to cardiac complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to commands may indicate a neurological complication, such as a stroke or seizure.
6. DVT and VTE: The patient's lower extremity edema may indicate a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of cholestasis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues, which could worsen and lead to complications such as bleeding or perforation."

   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to currentl level
   of care.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Awaiting
   ERCP per service.  Monitor LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Need to confirm baseline mental status with family.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has a history of CHF, COPD, NIDDM, and schizophrenia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving antimicrobial therapy for E. coli bacteremia, which was isolated in her blood.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. She has bilateral lower extremity edema and is unable to stand. Her respiratory status is compromised, with bibasilar crackles on examination.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, with a cholestatic pattern. The patient's coagulopathy has responded to vitamin K therapy. Her mental status is altered, with possible toxic-metabolic or medication-related causes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Development of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to sepsis and hypoxemia.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy.
4. Worsening of pre-existing chronic conditions, such as CHF, COPD, and NIDDM.
5. Delirium or dementia, which may worsen the patient's mental status.
6. Increased risk of falls due to altered mental status and decreased mobility.
7. Development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
8. Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) or UTI (urinary tract infection).
9. Potential need for invasive procedures, such as ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) or abdominal CT scan.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing her sepsis, optimizing her respiratory and cardiovascular status, and addressing her altered mental status. Close monitoring of her laboratory results and clinical status is essential to prevent or address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to currentl level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Awaiting
   ERCP per service.  Monitor LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Need to confirm baseline mental status with family.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutritional deficiency.  Monitor coags
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: Responding to current level of care, continue antimicrobials, and monitor blood cultures.
* E. coli bacteremia: Continue antimicrobials, monitor blood cultures, and consider abdominal computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): Cholestatic LFT pattern, RUQ US shows sludge with possible mass or biliary stone, and consider abd CT and ERCP.
* Altered mental status: Possible toxic-metabolic or related to medications, need to confirm baseline mental status with family.
* Pulmonary hypertension: Mild, as determined by cardiac echo.
* Coagulopathy: Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency, monitor coags.
* Tachycardia: MAT by ECG, monitor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis progression and organ dysfunction
* E. coli bacteremia progression and septic shock
* Cholangitis and biliary obstruction
* Hepatic failure and coagulopathy
* Respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Neurologic deterioration and increased intracranial pressure
* Cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrest
* Nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis and was intubated for ERCP. The patient's condition has been complicated by oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show increasing white blood cell count, rising liver enzymes, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and she has a cholestatic LFT pattern. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 153. The patient's blood pressure is borderline low, and she requires fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 60 mmHg.

The patient's abdominal examination is significant for a 2-cm stone in the common bile duct, which could not be removed during ERCP. The patient's urine output has been zero for the past 24 hours, and she has a high risk of developing acute tubular necrosis.

The patient's mental status is depressed, and she has a low threshold for developing delirium. The patient's electrolytes are abnormal, and she requires close monitoring to avoid complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
2. Acute tubular necrosis
3. Respiratory failure
4. Metabolic acidosis
5. Coagulopathy
6. Hepatic dysfunction
7. Renal failure
8. Cardiac failure
9. Pneumonia
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
11. Catheter-related bloodstream infections
12. Deep vein thrombosis
13. Pulmonary embolism
14. Sepsis-induced cardiac arrhythmias
15. Neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she has a full code as per her daughter's request. The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy and can be contacted at [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12841**]."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline

   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted to the ICU with gram-negative sepsis and underwent ERCP, which revealed a 2cm stone in the common bile duct that could not be removed. She was intubated and required vasopressors for 48 hours.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated and mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 382 mL. She has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 153 and an A-a gradient of 172.
* Cardiovascular status: Borderline hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg, requiring vasopressors. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Renal status: Anuric, with a recent creatinine bump at the onset of sepsis. She is at risk for impending hemodialysis.
* Hepatic status: Cholestatic liver function tests with a possibility of cholangitis. She has a history of cirrhosis, but this has not been confirmed.
* Coagulopathy: Likely related to liver dysfunction, but responded to vitamin K.
* Neurological status: Somnolent, with a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further adjustments to her ventilation settings to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's borderline hypotension may worsen, requiring further vasopressor support or consideration of inotropic therapy.
* Renal failure: The patient's anuria may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management to prevent impending hemodialysis.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's cholestatic liver function tests may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management to prevent further liver damage.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management to prevent bleeding complications.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's somnolence may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management to prevent further neurological deterioration.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation with adjustments to her ventilation settings as needed.
* Vasopressor support to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg or higher.
* Further evaluation and management of her anuria, including consideration of hemodialysis.
* Further evaluation and management of her cholestatic liver function tests, including consideration of further imaging studies.
* Continued monitoring of her coagulopathy, including consideration of further therapy.
* Further evaluation and management of her somnolence, including consideration of further neurological testing and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient underwent ERCP with stenting and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ESBL infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 80 bpm
* Blood pressure: 86/45 mmHg (borderline low)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Spontaneous tidal volume: 382 mL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.6-20.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 184-130 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3-1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20-23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 116-78 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is as follows:

* Total fluid input: 4,230 mL
* Total fluid output: 445 mL
* Urine output: 445 mL
* Fluid deficit: 3,785 mL

The patient's respiratory support is as follows:

* Ventilator mode: PRVC/AC
* Tidal volume: 500 mL (set) and 382 mL (spontaneous)
* Positive end-expiratory pressure: 5 cmH2O
* Fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%
* Respiratory system compliance: 48

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, but they are not responding to stimuli, and their movement and tone are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there is a risk of sepsis due to the suspected ESBL infection.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal failure.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, which can exacerbate their condition.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's borderline low blood pressure and tachycardia suggest potential cardiovascular instability.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli suggest potential neurological deterioration.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted to the ICU with gram-negative sepsis, which was likely caused by cholangitis, and required vasopressors for 48 hours. She underwent ERCP, which revealed a 2cm stone in the common bile duct that could not be removed.

The patient's current condition is critical, with increasing white blood cell count, labile blood pressure, and decreasing pulmonary function. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, but her respiratory function is compromised, and she is at risk for hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are increasing, suggesting cholestasis, and her coagulation profile is abnormal, likely due to liver dysfunction. She has a history of cirrhosis and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Her renal function is anuric, and she is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to multiple hypotensive episodes.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Gram-negative sepsis with cholangitis as the likely source.
2. Hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure.
3. Cholestatic LFT pattern with a 2cm stone in the common bile duct.
4. Anuric renal failure with suspected ischemic ATN.
5. Coagulopathy likely related to liver dysfunction.
6.?Hepatic dysfunction with cirrhosis as a possibility.
7. Demand ischemia with trending down troponin levels.
8. COPD with serial CXR and nebulizers as needed.
9. Schizophrenia with restart of home antipsychotics and hold on neurontin.
10. DM2 with insulin as needed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Broadening antibiotic coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vancomycin in case of MRSA.
2. Ongoing monitoring of LFTs, coagulation profile, and renal function.
3. Repeat ERCP this morning to assess the stent and consider additional imaging.
4. Consultation with renal service for possible impending hemodialysis.
5. Monitoring of electrolytes and NPO except for medications.
6. IVF boluses as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
7. Support oxygenation with ventilation for now.
8. Consideration of cortisol stim and diuresis.
9. Treatment of underlying infection, including sepsis, cholangitis, and COPD.
10. Restart of home antipsychotics and hold on neurontin.

The patient's code status is full code per family, and her disposition is unknown at this time."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to current level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver diseaes (elevated
   NH3). Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not requiring sedation
   continuous infusion.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN, perhaps contrast dye (related to ERCP).
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and related to sepsis and altered mental status. The possibility of aspiration pneumonia should be considered. Continuous mechanical ventilation and monitoring of ABG are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has E. coli bacteremia, which may have originated from the urinary tract or hepatobiliary system. The current level of care should be continued, and antimicrobials should be monitored.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Net volume expansion should be continued, and a central line may be necessary to allow repletion and monitoring of CVP.
4. Abnormal LFTs: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, showing a cholestatic pattern. A RUQ US shows sludge with a possible mass or biliary stone, which may be an element of chronicity. Cholangitis may be the source of E. coli. An abdominal CT scan may be necessary, and LFTs should be monitored.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to toxic-metabolic or medication-related causes. Evidence of chronic liver disease (elevated NH3) suggests that lactulose should be continued. Sedation with a continuous infusion is not currently necessary.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is acute and multifactorial, attributed to hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN, and possibly contrast dye. Monitoring of I/O and CVP is necessary.
7. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension as determined by cardiac echo.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutrition deficiency. Vit K should be continued, and PT and PTT should be monitored.
9. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is monitored, and the cause should be determined.
10. Fluid management: The patient's fluid management should be continued, with net repletion and monitoring of I/O and CVP.
11. Nutritional support: The patient should remain NPO pending completion of a GI evaluation. Tube feeding (TF) should be initiated once ileus resolves, and TPN may be necessary if the patient remains NPO.
12. COPD: The patient's COPD is stable, and usual medications should be continued.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to current level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver diseaes (elevated
   NH3). Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not requiring sedation
   continuous infusion.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN, perhaps contrast dye (related to ERCP).
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   SEPSIS -- E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source includes urinary
   vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Responding to current level
   of care.  Continue current management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- possible toxic-metabolic or related to
   medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver diseaes (elevated
   NH3). Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not requiring sedation
   continuous infusion.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN, perhaps contrast dye (related to ERCP).
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, primarily related to sepsis and altered mental status, with radiographic evidence of pleural effusions or atelectasis, and possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has E. coli bacteremia, with a possible source from the urinary tract or hepatobiliary system. The patient is responding to current treatment, but the source of the infection remains uncertain.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis (third spacing) and hypovolemia, requiring continued net volume expansion.
4. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has a cholestatic LFT pattern, with a possible mass or biliary stone in the RUQ, which may be related to chronicity or cholangitis.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to toxic-metabolic or medication-related causes, with evidence of chronic liver disease (elevated NH3).
6. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, multifactorial in origin, attributed to hypovolemia, sepsis, acute tubular necrosis, and possibly contrast dye.
7. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension, as determined by cardiac echo.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency, which has improved with Vitamin K therapy.
9. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which is being monitored.

The patient requires continued ICU care, including:

1. Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis management: Antimicrobial therapy and monitoring of blood cultures.
3. Fluid management: Continued net repletion and monitoring of I/O.
4. Nutrition: NPO pending completion of GI evaluation, with potential initiation of tube feeding or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
5. Coagulopathy management: Monitoring of PT, PTT, and Vitamin K therapy as needed.
6. Pulmonary hypertension management: Monitoring of cardiac echo and pulmonary function tests.
7. Renal failure management: Monitoring of renal function and fluid balance.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cirrhosis, likely secondary to chronic liver disease. The patient has undergone multiple procedures, including ERCP, and has been diagnosed with multi-lumen, intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation, and marked splenomegaly. The patient has also developed respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, tachycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications, but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has developed bacteremia with a Gram-negative rod, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to liver disease and may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen if not managed properly.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PT/PTT suggest coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's MRSA screen positive and Gram-negative rod bacteremia increase the risk of infection.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction may worsen if not managed properly, leading to liver failure.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # MAT:  In and out of MAT all day yesterday, currently in NSR at 80.
   - prn Dilt
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair

   # Schizophrenia:
   - restart home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream not yet speciated here.  Urine and blood cultures grew E.
   coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with MAPs around 60.
   White count is increasing today, with more labile bps.  Suspect recent
   decomponsation is secondary to recent instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes

   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors for 48 hours. She has increasing LFTs in a cholestatic pattern and is suspected to have cholangitis. She was electively intubated for ERCP and developed hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. She has an anuric kidney failure, likely due to ischemic ATN, and has a cholestatic LFT pattern. She also has a coagulopathy, possibly related to liver dysfunction, and is being treated with vitamin K. She has a possible diagnosis of cirrhosis and is being monitored for further liver dysfunction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cholangitis: The patient's cholestatic LFT pattern and intra-hepatic biliary dilatation on ultrasound suggest cholangitis, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death if left untreated.
2. Ischemic ATN: The patient's anuric kidney failure and history of hypotensive episodes suggest ischemic ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
3. Liver failure: The patient's cholestatic LFT pattern and possible diagnosis of cirrhosis suggest liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure requires ongoing mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to prevent further complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's gram-negative sepsis requires ongoing antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs of sepsis progression.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy requires ongoing monitoring and treatment with vitamin K to prevent bleeding complications.
7. Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis requires ongoing treatment with bicarbonate therapy to prevent further complications.
8. AMS: The patient's altered mental status requires ongoing treatment with sedatives and analgesics to prevent further complications.
9. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's possible diagnosis of cirrhosis and cholestatic LFT pattern suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and death if left untreated.

These potential complications highlight the importance of ongoing close monitoring and treatment of this patient's multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a PRVC/AC mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, and is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with anuria, and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
* Liver status: The patient has cholestatic liver function tests (LFTs) with a 2-cm stone in the common bile duct, which was stented during ERCP.
* Coagulation status: The patient has a coagulopathy, which responded to vitamin K.
* Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8, and is receiving sedation and analgesia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 20.3 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count (PLT): 130 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 66 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.4 g/dL
* Total bilirubin: 1.9 mg/dL
* Alkaline phosphatase: 480 IU/L
* Amylase: 34 IU/L
* Lipase: 21 IU/L
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Abdominal ultrasound (US): Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, common duct measuring up to 2.8 cm, multiple stones, air, and gallbladder wall thickening with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
* Computed tomography (CT) head: No acute intracranial process noted.
* ERCP: A 2-cm stone was removed, and the common bile duct was stented.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
* AKI: The patient has anuria, and there is a risk of further kidney damage.
* Liver failure: The patient has cholestatic LFTs, and there is a risk of further liver damage.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient has altered mental status, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.

The patient's care plan should include:

* Close monitoring of respiratory status, with adjustments to ventilation and oxygenation as needed.
* Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to manage AKI.
* Management of liver dysfunction, including lactulose and vitamin K therapy.
* Management of coagulopathy, including anticoagulation therapy.
* Neurological monitoring, with adjustments to sedation and analgesia as needed.
* Consultation with surgery to consider biliary drainage and management of cholangitis.
* Consultation with nephrology to consider further management of AKI.
* Consultation with gastroenterology to consider further management of liver dysfunction."

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and
   blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn,
   tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with
   MAPs around 60.  White count is increasing today, with more labile
   bps.  Suspect recent decomponsation is secondary to recent
   instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags
   .
   # MAT:  In and out of MAT all day yesterday, currently in NSR at 80.
   - prn Dilt
   - treat underlying infection
   - IVF boluses as needed

   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors for 48 hours, now found to have increasing LFTs in a
   cholestatic pattern.
   .
   # Gram-negative sepsis:  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in
   blood stream resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and
   blood cultures grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn,
   tobra, bactrim, and ertapenem.  Currently borderline hypontensive with
   MAPs around 60.  White count is increasing today, with more labile
   bps.  Suspect recent decomponsation is secondary to recent
   instrumentation.
   - broadened her coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vanc
   in case of
   - O/n had been giving IVF boluses to maintain MAP of >60, unfortunately
   this appears to be compromising pulmonary function, would favor
   levophed if maps dropping below 60 again.
   - f/u AM cortisol, consider cortisol stim.
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Attempts to go up on her pressure support failed to resolve her poor
   minute ventilation and she was placed on A/C with excellent result.
   Unfortunately this morning with her hypercapnea resolved she was noted
   to have an A-A gradient of 172 on labs, I suspect
   - though diuresis would likely be impossible anyway in this anuric
   patient, would hold off even if it were in a patient who is actively in
   and out of septic shock
   - support oxygenation with vent for now
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wastin RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb or LR over NS if necessary.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Unable to
   obtain urine lytes [**2-3**] anuria.  Had recent creatinine bump at OSH that
   had been trending down.
   - send urine lytes
   - consult renal for possible impending HD
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - plan for ERCP this morning, will f/u recs re: additional imaging;
   appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.
   - started lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.
   - cont. to monitor coags

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information can be summarized:

**Medical History:**

* Patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia.
* She presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors for 48 hours.

**Current Status:**

* The patient is currently intubated and sedated, not following commands.
* She has oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.
* Her laboratory results show increasing white blood cell count, increasing liver function tests (LFTs) in a cholestatic pattern, and hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis.
* She has a cholestatic LFT pattern, possibly related to cholangitis, and may have cirrhosis.
* Her coagulopathy is likely related to liver dysfunction, and her coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatic dysfunction.
* Cholangitis, potentially leading to biliary sepsis and secondary infections.
* Cirrhosis, potentially leading to portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites.
* Coagulopathy, potentially leading to bleeding complications.
* Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Anuric patient, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure, potentially leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory muscle weakness.
* Hepatic encephalopathy, potentially leading to altered mental status and seizures.

**Plan:**

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative sepsis.
* Monitor LFTs, coagulation profile, and electrolytes.
* Consider ERCP for further evaluation and management of cholangitis.
* Repeat RUQ ultrasound to determine the presence of cirrhosis.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction and adjust management accordingly.
* Consider diuresis and hemodialysis for anuric patient.
* Monitor for respiratory failure and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
* Monitor for hepatic encephalopathy and adjust management accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CHF, COPD, NIDDM, and schizophrenia, currently admitted to the ICU with GNR sepsis, increasing LFTs, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: Persistent, primarily related to sepsis and altered mental status, with radiographic evidence of pleural effusions or possibly aspiration pneumonia.
* Altered mental status: Encephalopathy, possibly related to toxic-metabolic or medication-induced causes, with evidence of chronic liver disease and elevated NH3 levels.
* Tachycardia: SVT, suspected to be re-entrant circuit, with ongoing neosinephrine support for BP management.
* Sepsis: Persistent, with E. coli isolated in blood, possible source including urinary or hepatobiliary (cholangitis).
* Hypotension: Attributed to sepsis (third spacing) and hypovolemia, with ongoing volume expansion and central line placement.
* Abnormal LFTs: Cholestatic pattern, with RUQ US showing sludge and possible mass or biliary stone.
* Renal failure: Acute, multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia, sepsis, and ATN.
* Hypophosphatemia: Replete.
* Pulmonary hypertension: Mild, as determined by cardiac echo.
* Coagulopathy: Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutrition deficiency, improved with Vit K and monitored.
* Tachycardia: MAT by ECG, monitored.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG.
* Continue lactulose for encephalopathy and avoid sedatives.
* Monitor HR and continue neosinephrine support.
* Continue antimicrobials for E. coli bacteremia and monitor blood cultures.
* Monitor LFTs and consider abdominal CT.
* Monitor UO, BUN, and creatinine for renal failure.
* Replete hypophosphatemia.
* Monitor PT, PTT for coagulopathy.
* Monitor fluid balance and CVP if central line replaced.
* Continue nutrition support, including NPO and possible TPN if necessary.
* Continue COPD management with usual meds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure worsening or not responding to treatment.
* Altered mental status worsening or not improving with lactulose and sedative avoidance.
* Sepsis spreading or not responding to antimicrobials.
* Renal failure worsening or not improving with volume expansion and ATN management.
* Coagulopathy worsening or not responding to Vit K and monitoring.
* Pulmonary hypertension worsening or not improving with cardiac echo monitoring.
* Other complications related to underlying conditions, such as CHF, COPD, and NIDDM.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis, and
   increasing LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- SVT, suspect re-entrant circuit.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source
   includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Moderate
   ascites, raises possibility of Responding to current level of care.
   Continue current management.  Need to discuss plans for further
   intervention -- concern about persistent CBD stone.  General Surgery
   consult, need to consider surgical exploration or percutaneous
   drainage.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:

   TACHYCARDIA -- SVT, suspect re-entrant circuit.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli isolated in blood.  Possible source
   includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis).  Moderate
   ascites, raises possibility of Responding to current level of care.
   Continue current management.  Need to discuss plans for further
   intervention -- concern about persistent CBD stone.  General Surgery
   consult, need to consider surgical exploration or percutaneous
   drainage.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.
   E.COli BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  Continue
   antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Multifactorial, and attributed to hypovolemia,
   sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- replete.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   TACHYCARDIA -- MAT by ECG.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP if central
   line replaced.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to sepsis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with persistent hypotension and tachycardia. He has a central line in place, and vasopressors are being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 60 mmHg. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7-9 cm H2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, which may indicate chronic liver disease. His blood cultures have grown E. coli, and he is being treated with antimicrobials.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). His chest radiograph shows pleural effusions, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure.

The patient's neurologic status is altered, with encephalopathy and a possible toxic-metabolic component. He is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is persistent and may be related to his urinary or hepatobiliary source. He may require further intervention, including surgical exploration or percutaneous drainage.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent and may be related to his sepsis, altered mental status, and COPD. He may require further mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's encephalopathy may be related to his sepsis, toxic-metabolic component, or chronic liver disease. He may require further evaluation, including a head computed tomography (CT) scan or electroencephalogram (EEG).
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to his sepsis, hypovolemia, and vasopressor use. He may require further fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be related to his underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutrition deficiency. He may require further evaluation and treatment, including vitamin K administration.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may be acute and multifactorial, related to his hypovolemia, sepsis, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He may require further evaluation and treatment, including dialysis.
7. Hypophosphatemia: The patient's hypophosphatemia may be related to his sepsis, hypovolemia, and nutrition deficiency. He may require further evaluation and treatment, including phosphate supplementation.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension, coagulopathy, renal failure, and hypophosphatemia. He requires further evaluation and treatment, including surgical intervention, mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and nutritional support."

Based on the provided medical progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors. She underwent ERCP, which revealed a 2cm stone in the CBD, and was stented. She has developed septic shock, oliguria/anuria, and renal failure. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and she has a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, acute tachycardia, and elevated troponin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock is likely due to cholangitis, and she requires continued vasopressor support.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient has developed oliguria/anuria and renal failure, which may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and she requires continued mechanical ventilation.
4. **Hepatic Dysfunction:** The patient's LFTs are abnormal, and she has a cholestatic pattern, which may indicate liver dysfunction. She may require further evaluation and treatment for liver disease.
5. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has a coagulopathy, which may be related to liver dysfunction. She requires continued monitoring of her coagulation status.
6. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin may indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction. She requires further evaluation and treatment for cardiac complications.
7. **Infectious Complications:** The patient has bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction. She requires continued antimicrobial therapy and close monitoring for signs of infection.
8. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she requires continued nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and related complications.
9. **Psychiatric Complications:** The patient has a history of schizophrenia and may experience psychiatric complications, such as delirium or depression, due to her underlying medical conditions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue vasopressor support for septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
3. Continue mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
4. Evaluate and treat liver dysfunction if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and consider transfusion therapy if necessary.
6. Evaluate and treat cardiac complications if necessary.
7. Continue antimicrobial therapy for bacteremia.
8. Provide nutritional support to prevent malnutrition.
9. Monitor the patient's psychiatric status and provide supportive care as necessary.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. Consider converting the patient to linezolid to cover for possible VRE.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider correcting abnormalities.
3. Consider repeating abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for cirrhosis.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider restarting home antipsychotics.
5. Consider restarting insulin therapy for DM2."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of encephalopathy, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episodes, which have been managed with carotid massage, adenosine, and amiodarone. The patient has also been experiencing fever, oliguria, and anuria, with a possible diagnosis of septic shock and renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin levels, indicating inflammation and possible cardiac damage. The patient's imaging studies reveal a markedly dilated biliary tree with a large impacted stone, which is the most likely septic source.

The patient's microbiology results show Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains in blood cultures, and Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in bile cultures. The patient's sputum culture shows budding yeast with pseudohyphae.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 135 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 100/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Arterial blood gas: pH 7.16, PaCO2 46 mmHg, PaO2 160 mmHg

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate level and oliguria/anuria suggest septic shock, which can lead to multiorgan failure if not managed promptly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine level indicate possible renal failure, which can exacerbate septic shock.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's recurrent SVT episodes and elevated troponin level suggest possible cardiac damage, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest possible respiratory failure, which can exacerbate septic shock.
5. Biliary sepsis: The patient's dilated biliary tree and Gram-positive cocci in bile cultures suggest possible biliary sepsis, which can lead to septic shock and multiorgan failure if not managed promptly.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and Gram-positive cocci in blood cultures suggest possible infection, which can exacerbate septic shock and multiorgan failure.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis suggests possible metabolic acidosis, which can exacerbate septic shock and multiorgan failure.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose level suggests possible hyperglycemia, which can exacerbate septic shock and multiorgan failure.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia, who is currently in the ICU with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 30.9
* Hct: 29.6
* Plt: 172
* Cr: 1.7
* TropT: 0.41
* TCO2: 20
* Glucose: 77
* Albumin: 1.8 g/dL
* LDH: 318 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal:

* CT A/P: Markedly dilated biliary tree with a large impacted stone, moderate ascites, and a nondilated gallbladder with air and sludge.
* Microbiology: Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, with GNRs resistant to cipro and sensitive to meropenem.

The patient's clinical picture is complex, with multiple potential medical complications, including:

* Septic shock
* Oliguria/anuria/renal failure
* Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Tachycardia, elevated troponin
* Altered mental status (likely multifactorial)
* Anuric (suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes)
* Cholestatic LFT pattern (ERCP revealed a 2cm stone, which could not be removed, and her CBD was stented)
*?Hepatic dysfunction (patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical stigmata of telangectasia, and mildly elevated ammonia)
* Coagulopathy (likely related to liver dysfunction)
* MAT (in and out of MAT all day yesterday, currently in NSR at 80)

The patient's management plan includes:

* Broadened coverage to include meropenem in case of ESBL and vancomycin in case of MRSA
* Conversion to neo to avoid beta agonism
* Consult surgery for worsening clinical picture and? biliary drainage
* Support oxygenation with vent for now
* Cont PRVC, if dysynchronous, can try PSV
* Monitor LFTs, coags, and ERCP recs
* Repeat abdominal u/s to determine if cirrhosis is present
* Cont lactulose
* Monitor coags and treat underlying infection
* Restart home antipsychotics and hold neurontin for now given mental status

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Recurrent SVT yesterday, with evidence for a-flutter --> now on
   Amnioderone.
   With overall clinical decline, persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs (know
   retained stone and dilated intrahepatic ducts) --> surgical evaluation
   recommended percutaneous drainage.
   IR place percutaneous tube, with return of thick material.
   Remains on vasopressors.
   Mental status somewhat improved, now occasionally turning head to
   voice.

   Total time spent: 75 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a history of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial flutter. He has also developed acute kidney injury, acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to sepsis and altered mental status, with radiographic evidence of pleural effusions or possible aspiration pneumonia.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has encephalopathy, which may be related to toxic-metabolic or medication-related causes, and may also be exacerbated by chronic liver disease.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is attributed to underlying cardiac disease and probable new SVT, with evidence of atrial flutter.
4. Sepsis: The patient has persistent sepsis, with E. coli and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) isolated in blood, and possible sources including urinary, hepatobiliary, and line-related infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia, with plans to continue net volume expansion and monitor cardiac enzymes.
6. Abnormal LFTs: The patient has a cholestatic LFT pattern, with possible mass or biliary stone in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and possible cholangitis as the source of E. coli.
7. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is multifactorial and attributed to hypovolemia, sepsis, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which is likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutritional deficiency, and has been improved with vitamin K.
9. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has mild pulmonary hypertension, as determined by cardiac echo.
10. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, with plans to continue net repletion and monitor input/output (I/O).

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider EEG and head MRI if altered mental status persists.
3. Continue antimicrobials and monitor blood cultures.
4. Consider abdominal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the patient's liver function and possible biliary obstruction.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and consider initiating lactulose if the patient's mental status worsens.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider placement of a central line to allow for repletion and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP).
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider initiating renal replacement therapy if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and continue to administer vitamin K as needed.
10. Consider placing a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the patient's stomach and prevent aspiration pneumonia."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Recurrent SVT yesterday, with evidence for a-flutter --> now on
   Amnioderone.
   With overall clinical decline, persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs (know
   retained stone and dilated intrahepatic ducts) --> surgical evaluation
   recommended percutaneous drainage.
   IR place percutaneous tube, with return of thick material.
   Remains on vasopressors.
   Mental status somewhat improved, now occasionally turning head to
   voice.

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Recurrent SVT yesterday, with evidence for a-flutter --> now on
   Amnioderone.
   With overall clinical decline, persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs (know
   retained stone and dilated intrahepatic ducts) --> surgical evaluation
   recommended percutaneous drainage.
   IR place percutaneous tube, with return of thick material.
   Remains on vasopressors.
   Mental status somewhat improved, now occasionally turning head to
   voice.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and schizophrenia. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, sepsis, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated since admission. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Heart rate: 131 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Overweight, obese, and not well-nourished
* Eyes: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light)
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse and blood pressure
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, no wheezing or crackles
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and distended
* Extremities: Right and left lower extremity edema
* Skin: Warm and without rash or jaundice

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 30.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 172 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 42 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 194 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 27 U/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 47 U/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 578 U/L
* Total bilirubin: 5.2 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and his respiratory status is unstable.
4. Liver failure: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, indicating possible liver failure.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, which can worsen with sepsis and other comorbidities.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating coagulopathy.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypophosphatemia, which can worsen with ongoing sepsis and acute kidney injury.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is NPO, and his nutritional status is likely compromised.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and consider cardiac echo to assess for vegetations.
3. Continue antimicrobials and monitor blood cultures.
4. Consider abdominal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate for cholangitis and biliary obstruction.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
7. Continue to net replete and monitor I/O.
8. Consider TPN if the patient remains NPO.
9. Maintain contact with the family and update them on the patient's condition and plans."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   Remains intubated, mechanically ventilated.
   Recurrent SVT yesterday, with evidence for a-flutter --> now on
   Amnioderone.
   With overall clinical decline, persistent sepsis, abnormal LFTs (know
   retained stone and dilated intrahepatic ducts) --> surgical evaluation
   recommended percutaneous drainage.
   IR place percutaneous tube, with return of thick material.
   Remains on vasopressors.
   Mental status somewhat improved, now occasionally turning head to
   voice.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yof CHF, COPD, NIDDM, schizophrenia now with GNR sepsis,
   choledocholithiasis (retained CBD stone) and persistently abnormal
   LFTs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent, predominately related to sepsis and
   altered mental status, on background of COPD.  Radiographic evidence
   for pleural effusions, or perhaps component of atalectasis.  Need to
   consider possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Encephalopathy.  Possible toxic-metabolic or
   related to medications.  Evidence for component of chronic liver
   diseaes (elevated NH3).  No evidence for acute CVA.  Doubt seizures
   with post-ictal state.  Plan continue lactulose.  Currrently not
   requiring sedation continuous infusion.  Avoid sedatives.  If persists
   or worsens, would check head MRI, EEG and consider CSF analysis.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Underlying MAT, and probable new SVT, suspect re-entrant
   circuit and evidence for atrial flutter.  Monitor HR.  Continue
   neosinephrine (rather than levophed) for BP support.
   SEPSIS -- Persisent.  E. coli and GPC isolated in blood.  Possible
   source includes urinary vs. hepatobiliary (possible cholangitis) and
   line related.  Evidence for biliary obstruction and cholangitis --> due
   to retained CBD stone --> now s/p percutaneous drainage per IR.
   Moderate ascites, raises possibility of SBP.  Continue current
   management.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis (3rd spacing) and hypovolemia.
   Continue net volume expansion. [**Month (only) 51**] require placement of central line,
   to allow repleteion and monitoring of CVP.  Monitor cardiac enzymes.
   E. Coli & GPC BACTEREMIA -- urinary source vs. hepatobiliary.  And now
   line-related.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor blood cultures.  Check
   cardiac echo to assess for veggetations.  Await identification of GPC.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- Cholestatic LFT pattern.  RUQ US shows sludge with
   possible mass vs. biliary stone -- may be element of chronicity.
   Cholangitis may be the source of E. col.  Consider abd CT.  Monitor
   LFTs.
   ABD DISTENTION -- 3rd spacing, intraabdominal sepsis.  Monitor bladder
   pressure (may be contributing to renal failure).
   ACIDOSIS -- persistent.  Multifactorial.  Attributed to sepsis, acute
   renal failure.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute. Oliguric.  Multifactorial, and attributed to
   hypovolemia, sepsis, ATN.  Monitor UO, BUN,creatinine.  [**Month (only) 51**] require
   renal replacement therapy soon, if acceptable to patient.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- repleted iv to normal value.
   PULMONARY HTN -- mild as determined by cardiac echo
   COAGULOPATHY --Likely related to underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis
   and nutrition deficincy.  Improved with Vit K.  Monitor PT, PTT.
   FLUIDS
 Continue to net replete, monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP --> aim for
   > 10 cmH2O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 NPO pending completion of GI evaluation.  Would
   like to initiate TF once ileus resolves.  Consider TPN if remains NPO.
   COPD
 No evidence for active exacerbation.  Continue usual meds.
   GOALS OF CARE -- repeated requests to meet with family HCP without
   success.  Maintain contact, hope to meet today to update and define
   plans.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CHF, COPD, NIDDM, and schizophrenia, who is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, and altered mental status. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and has a history of recurrent SVT and atrial flutter. He has abnormal LFTs, and a retained CBD stone has been drained percutaneously. He has also developed acute renal failure, acidosis, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition is critical, and his treatment plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy, and management of his various organ dysfunctions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is persistent, and he may require continued antimicrobial therapy to treat the underlying infection.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and he may require continued lactulose therapy to manage his encephalopathy.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to his underlying MAT and sepsis, and he may require continued monitoring of his heart rate.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to his sepsis and hypovolemia, and he may require continued fluid resuscitation and monitoring of his blood pressure.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, and he may require renal replacement therapy soon if his condition does not improve.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to his underlying liver dysfunction, sepsis, and nutrition deficiency, and he may require continued monitoring of his coagulation studies.
8. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is mild, but may worsen if his respiratory status deteriorates.
9. GI complications: The patient's GI status is critical, and he may require continued monitoring of his abdominal distension and potential GI bleeding.
10. Infection: The patient's infection is persistent, and he may require continued antimicrobial therapy to treat the underlying infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's breathing.
2. Continue antimicrobial therapy to treat the patient's sepsis.
3. Manage the patient's altered mental status with lactulose therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's tachycardia and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
5. Continue fluid resuscitation and monitor the patient's blood pressure.
6. Consider renal replacement therapy if the patient's acute renal failure does not improve.
7. Continue monitoring of the patient's coagulation studies and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
9. Continue monitoring of the patient's GI status and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
10. Consider TPN if the patient remains NPO and his nutritional needs are not being met."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  VRE bacteremia had been missed by prior abx, now
   covered.  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in blood stream
   resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and blood cultures
   grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Now has GPCs in pairs in chains from anaerobic bottle.
   White count cont to be elevated, with more stable blood pressure on
   neo.  Hemodynamically stable in setting of recurrent bouts of SVT.
   Suspect deterioration overnight [**2-3**] [**Name (NI) 12932**] PTC drain placement.  On
   neo, cont to avoid levo given SVT.  Patient now has decompressed
   biliary tree, with thick green output from drain.
   - would d/c vanc
   - Started linezolide d2/14
   - bolus to keep SVV around 10
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - Note that stone has still not been retrieved, but drainage seems
   effective with drastic drop in LFTs
   - HD catheter?
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  At
   the moment ABG
s are as good as they have been, would be interesting to
   see how she does on her own.  Will turn down FiO2
    - attempt presssure support
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Given increasing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consult surgery, ? biliary
   drainage.  Other less likely etiologies include NCSE, post-ictal,
   hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis, all unlikely.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment.
   - Renal is planning for CVVH today
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Now on amio gtt.  Evidence of MAT
   on repeat ECG.
   - will cont amio gtt for time being, avoiding rate control meds given
   hypotension
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - ERCP recs, IR recs, [**Doctor First Name **] recs, appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.  Repeat abdominal
   u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely
   [**2-3**]  septic shock and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   - cont. to monitor coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs.  Will trend.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair

   # Schizophrenia:
   - restart home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  VRE bacteremia had been missed by prior abx, now
   covered.  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in blood stream
   resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and blood cultures
   grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Now has GPCs in pairs in chains from anaerobic bottle.
   White count cont to be elevated, with more stable blood pressure on
   neo.  Hemodynamically stable in setting of recurrent bouts of SVT.
   Suspect deterioration overnight [**2-3**] [**Name (NI) 12932**] PTC drain placement.  On
   neo, cont to avoid levo given SVT.  Patient now has decompressed
   biliary tree, with thick green output from drain.
   - would d/c vanc
   - Started linezolide d2/14
   - bolus to keep SVV around 10
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - Note that stone has still not been retrieved, but drainage seems
   effective with drastic drop in LFTs
   - HD catheter?
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  At
   the moment ABG
s are as good as they have been, would be interesting to
   see how she does on her own.  Will turn down FiO2
    - attempt presssure support
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Given increasing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consult surgery, ? biliary
   drainage.  Other less likely etiologies include NCSE, post-ictal,
   hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis, all unlikely.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment.
   - Renal is planning for CVVH today
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Now on amio gtt.  Evidence of MAT
   on repeat ECG.
   - will cont amio gtt for time being, avoiding rate control meds given
   hypotension
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - ERCP recs, IR recs, [**Doctor First Name **] recs, appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.  Repeat abdominal
   u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely
   [**2-3**]  septic shock and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   - cont. to monitor coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs.  Will trend.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - restart home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix
   .
   # FEN:  IVF boluses as above, monitor electrolytes, NPO except for meds
   # PPx:  pneumoboots and SC heparin, bowel regimen, pantoprazole

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors. The patient has undergone several interventions, including ERCP, which revealed a 2cm stone in the CBD that could not be removed. She has also developed cholangitis, and her LFTs are improving with antibiotic treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which can lead to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, which requires ongoing mechanical ventilation.
3. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which requires careful management of electrolytes and fluids.
4. Anuric kidney injury: The patient has developed anuric kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has cholestatic LFT pattern, which may indicate liver dysfunction or cirrhosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may be related to liver dysfunction or septic shock.
7. Demand ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate demand ischemia.
8. COPD exacerbation: The patient has COPD, which may exacerbate with ongoing respiratory failure.
9. Schizophrenia: The patient has schizophrenia, which requires ongoing management with antipsychotics.
10. DM2: The patient has DM2, which requires ongoing management with insulin and other medications.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Ongoing antibiotic treatment for VRE bacteremia and GNR sepsis.
2. Management of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation.
3. Monitoring and management of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
4. Dialysis for anuric kidney injury.
5. Management of hepatic dysfunction with lactulose and vitamin K.
6. Coagulopathy management with fibrinogen monitoring and replacement therapy if necessary.
7. Demand ischemia monitoring with serial troponin levels.
8. COPD management with serial CXR and nebulizers as needed.
9. Schizophrenia management with restart of home antipsychotics and hold on neurontin.
10. DM2 management with insulin and other medications as needed.

The patient's family should be encouraged to visit and be involved in her care. The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  VRE bacteremia had been missed by prior abx, now
   covered.  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in blood stream
   resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and blood cultures
   grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Now has GPCs in pairs in chains from anaerobic bottle.
   White count cont to be elevated, with more stable blood pressure on
   neo.  Hemodynamically stable in setting of recurrent bouts of SVT.
   Suspect deterioration overnight [**2-3**] [**Name (NI) 12932**] PTC drain placement.  On
   neo, cont to avoid levo given SVT.  Patient now has decompressed
   biliary tree, with thick green output from drain.

   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - Note that stone has still not been retrieved, but drainage seems
   effective with drastic drop in LFTs
   - HD catheter?
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  At
   the moment ABG
s are as good as they have been, would be interesting to
   see how she does on her own.  Will turn down FiO2
    - attempt presssure support

   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection

   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment.
   - Renal is planning for CVVH today

   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Now on amio gtt.  Evidence of MAT
   on repeat ECG.
   - will cont amio gtt for time being, avoiding rate control meds given
   hypotension
   .
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - ERCP recs, IR recs, [**Doctor First Name **] recs, appreciate input

   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia

   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.  Repeat abdominal
   u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who was admitted with gram-negative sepsis and is currently in the ICU. She has been treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and other medications. Her condition has been complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, hypercapnia, and anuric renal failure. She has also had episodes of SVT and has been treated with amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to VRE bacteremia, which has been treated with antibiotics. However, the patient remains at risk for further complications, including organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying COPD and the use of sedatives. She requires mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient's anuric renal failure is likely due to ischemic ATN, which is a common complication of septic shock. She requires dialysis to support her renal function.
4. Cholestatic LFT Pattern: The patient's cholestatic LFT pattern is likely due to her underlying liver dysfunction and the use of antibiotics. She requires further monitoring of her LFTs and coagulation studies.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's hepatic dysfunction is likely due to her underlying liver disease and the use of antibiotics. She requires further monitoring of her liver function and coagulation studies.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to her underlying liver dysfunction and the use of antibiotics. She requires further monitoring of her coagulation studies.
7. Demand Ischemia: The patient's demand ischemia is likely due to her underlying heart disease and the use of vasopressors. She requires further monitoring of her cardiac function and blood pressure.
8. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia is likely to be a complication of her underlying medical condition and the use of medications. She requires further monitoring of her mental status and medication regimen.
9. Gastritis/PUD: The patient's gastritis/PUD is likely due to her underlying medical condition and the use of medications. She requires further monitoring of her gastric function and medication regimen.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess the effectiveness of her treatment.
2. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation to support the patient's breathing.
3. Continue to provide dialysis to support the patient's renal function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and coagulation studies to assess the effectiveness of her treatment.
5. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to further evaluate the patient's cholestatic LFT pattern and potential complications.
6. Consider consulting a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's demand ischemia and potential complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and medication regimen to assess the effectiveness of her treatment.
8. Consider consulting a psychiatrist to further evaluate the patient's schizophrenia and potential complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's gastric function and medication regimen to assess the effectiveness of her treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  VRE bacteremia had been missed by prior abx, now
   covered.  Most likely source is cholangitis, GNR
s in blood stream
   resistant to cipro, sensitive to meropenem.  Urine and blood cultures
   grew E. coli sensitive to CTX, ceftaz, gent, zosyn, tobra, bactrim, and
   ertapenem.  Now has GPCs in pairs in chains from anaerobic bottle.
   White count cont to be elevated, with more stable blood pressure on
   neo.  Hemodynamically stable in setting of recurrent bouts of SVT.
   Suspect deterioration overnight [**2-3**] [**Name (NI) 12932**] PTC drain placement.  On
   neo, cont to avoid levo given SVT.  Patient now has decompressed
   biliary tree, with thick green output from drain.
   - would d/c vanc
   - Started [**Last Name (un) **] for linezolide d2/14
   - Note that stone has still not been retrieved
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Overnight post-procedure, increasing tachypnea, ABG showed impaired
   oxygenation, which improved on increased PEEP.  ABG also suggested
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, without full respiratory
   compensation.  Pt at risk to develop ARDS.
   - cont AC, increase rate, and recheck ABG, attempt to increase minute
   ventilation
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Suspect Normal Saline
   fluid resuscitation vs. Bicarb wasting RTA in early renal faillure.
   Would bolus back with D5 bicarb as above.
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure, ?hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Given increasing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consult surgery, ? biliary
   drainage.  Other less likely etiologies include NCSE, post-ictal,
   hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis, all unlikely.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment.
   - Renal consult today, will try to discuss goals of care with family
   prior to placing HD line
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Now on amio gtt.  Evidence of MAT
   on repeat ECG.
   - will cont amio gtt for time being, avoiding rate control meds given
   hypotension
   # Cholestatic LFT pattern:  ERCP revealed a 2cm stone which could not
   be removed, her CBD was stented, no report as to puss or not.
   Cholangitis may be the source of GNRs, Her LFTs continue to improve
   with abx and are down with stent placement.
   - monitor LFTs, coags
   - ERCP recs, IR recs, [**Doctor First Name **] recs, appreciate input
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH, but would repeat in house to determine for sure.  Repeat abdominal
   u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Likely related the liver dysfunction.  Interestingly,
   her coagulopathy responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely
   [**2-3**]  septic shock and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   - cont. to monitor coags, fibrinogen
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs.  Will trend.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - restart home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.
   Overnight post-procedure, increasing tachypnea, ABG showed impaired
   oxygenation, which improved on increased PEEP.  ABG also suggested
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, without full respiratory
   compensation.  Pt at risk to develop ARDS.
   - cont AC, increase rate, and recheck ABG, attempt to increase minute
   ventilation

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors, and was found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is stable on neo, but she has recurrent bouts of SVT, which may indicate ongoing septic shock.
2. Hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient was electively intubated for ERCP and has been experiencing increasing tachypnea and hypercapnea, which may lead to ARDS.
3. Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidemia and hypercapnea may be related to Normal Saline fluid resuscitation or Bicarb wasting RTA in early renal failure.
4. AMS: The patient's AMS may be multifactorial, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy, retained sedatives, and hypercapnea.
5. Anuric kidney failure: The patient's creatinine has increased, and she has muddy brown casts on urine sediment, which may indicate ischemic ATN.
6. SVT: The patient has had recurrent episodes of SVT, which may be related to AVRT/AVNRT or MAT.
7. Cholestatic LFT pattern: The patient's LFTs are improving with abx and stent placement, but she may still be at risk for cholangitis.
8. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has low albumin, poor coags, and physical stigmata of telangectasia, which may indicate cirrhosis.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be related to liver dysfunction, and she may require continued monitoring and treatment.
10. Demand ischemia: The patient's Trop I has trended down, but may be elevated again in the setting of recent SVTs.
11. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen due to her respiratory failure and hypercapnea.
12. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia may be exacerbated by her medical condition and treatment.
13. DM2: The patient's DM2 may worsen due to her hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.
14. Gastritis/PUD: The patient's gastritis/PUD may worsen due to her stress ulcer and hyperglycemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and shock. They have been intubated and are receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and is currently on amiodarone drip. They have also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and are receiving dialysis. The patient has a high risk of developing complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central lines increase their risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and prolonged intubation increase their risk of developing stress ulcer.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ongoing acute renal failure increases their risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure increases their risk of developing chronic respiratory disease and requiring long-term mechanical ventilation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis increases their risk of developing septic shock and organ failure.
7. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation/flutter increases their risk of developing stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust dialysis settings as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust feeding regimens as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's risk of developing VAP and take measures to prevent it, such as elevating the head of bed and performing oral care.
6. Monitor the patient's risk of developing DVT and take measures to prevent it, such as using anticoagulant medications and compression stockings.
7. Monitor the patient's risk of developing stress ulcer and take measures to prevent it, such as using proton pump inhibitors and maintaining a high gastric pH.
8. Monitor the patient's risk of developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease and take measures to prevent it, such as maintaining good blood pressure control and avoiding nephrotoxic medications.
9. Monitor the patient's risk of developing chronic respiratory disease and taking measures to prevent it, such as maintaining good lung function and avoiding respiratory depressants.
10. Monitor the patient's risk of developing septic shock and organ failure and take measures to prevent it, such as maintaining good perfusion and avoiding hypovolemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers

   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with gram-negative sepsis and required vasopressors.

The patient's current status is as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and her PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 230.
2. Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and her current cardiac status is complicated by septic shock, tachycardia, and irregular rhythm.
3. Renal: The patient has anuric kidney failure, with a recent creatinine bump and muddy brown casts on urine sediment. She is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
4. Hepatic: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, including AST and ALT, and a mildly elevated ammonia level. Cirrhosis is a possibility, but an ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of cirrhosis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that responded to vitamin K, and her coagulation studies are pending.
6. Neurological: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is currently sedated. Her mental status is altered, and she is unable to follow commands.
7. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastritis and is receiving proton pump inhibitors.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and there is a risk of further decline.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is complicated by septic shock, tachycardia, and irregular rhythm, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuric kidney failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and mildly elevated ammonia level suggest ongoing hepatic dysfunction, which may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if not managed properly, leading to bleeding complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and sedation may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving critical care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and other healthcare providers."

   CXR [**1-31**]
   Extensive consolidation in the right lung has increased substantially
   since
   [**1-28**] and [**1-30**], accompanied by increasing moderate right
   pleural
   effusion most likely pneumonia, conceivably pulmonary hemorrhage. Left
   lower
   lobe is persistently consolidated, and accompanying small left pleural
   effusion unchanged. Severe cardiomegaly is stable as is vascular
   congestion
   in the left lung. ET tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no
   less
   than 6.5 cm from the carina, 3 cm above optimal placement. New
   dual-channel
   right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the low SVC alongside
   an
   indwelling left internal jugular line. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly
   is
   unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstone. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  On neo to maintain pressures to
   tolerate CVVH, cont to avoid levo given SVT.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Now on amio gtt.  Evidence of MAT
   on repeat ECG.
   - will cont amio gtt given inability to take Pos and borderline BPs,
   0.5mg/min
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   - cont lactulose
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   - cont. to monitor coags, fibrinogen

   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs.  Will trend.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to E. coli and VRE bacteremia, and has undergone percutaneous drain placement for cholangitis. She has also been diagnosed with hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, anuric kidney failure, and possible hepatic dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that may arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Infection progression: The patient's bacteremia may progress to more severe infections, such as septicemia or endocarditis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuric kidney failure may progress to more severe kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplantation.
5. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's possible hepatic dysfunction may worsen, leading to liver failure or encephalopathy.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or death.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's possible hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, leading to coma or death.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or death.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastritis/PUD may worsen, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's possible demand ischemia may worsen, leading to myocardial infarction or death.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should receive aggressive treatment for her septic shock, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care. She should also receive close monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction, infection progression, and respiratory failure. Additionally, her underlying conditions, such as CHF, COPD, and DM2, should be managed according to established treatment guidelines."

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Cholangitis, biliary sepsis status post CBD stent,
   retained stone.  WBC drifting back up, will check a repeat
   differential.  Abdominal exam benign and unchanged.  Still requiring
   low-dose neo.  Repeat blood/urine/bile cultures sent. Continue current
   antibiotics.
 DIARRHEA:  Send stool for C.diff given rising WBC.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to ATN. No started on CVVH. Plan for
   gradual removal of volume albeit this will be slow given poor
   nutritional status, low albumin.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Reasons for difficutly to
   wean is multi-factorial.  Mostly limited by volume overload and
   possible VAP.  Sputum gram stain and culture sent again given rising
   WBC to see if there is a new organism not covered by broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
 ATIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER:  Plan to change amiodarone drip to per
   NGT now that she is tolerating tube feeds.
 ALTERED NUTRITIONAL STATUS:  Tolerating initiation of tube feeds
   without residuals.  Titrate to goal.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Following simple commands
   (wiggle toes) intermittently.  Remains off sedation, appears
   comfortable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Cholangitis, biliary sepsis status post CBD stent,
   retained stone.  WBC drifting back up, will check a repeat
   differential.  Abdominal exam benign and unchanged.  Still requiring
   low-dose neo.  Repeat blood/urine/bile cultures sent. Continue current
   antibiotics.
 DIARRHEA:  Send stool for C.diff given rising WBC.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to ATN. No started on CVVH. Plan for
   gradual removal of volume albeit this will be slow given poor
   nutritional status, low albumin.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Reasons for difficutly to
   wean is multi-factorial.  Mostly limited by volume overload and
   possible VAP.  Sputum gram stain and culture sent again given rising
   WBC to see if there is a new organism not covered by broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
 ATIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER:  Plan to change amiodarone drip to per
   NGT now that she is tolerating tube feeds.
 ALTERED NUTRITIONAL STATUS:  Tolerating initiation of tube feeds
   without residuals.  Titrate to goal.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Following simple commands
   (wiggle toes) intermittently.  Remains off sedation, appears
   comfortable.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has a history of cholangitis and biliary sepsis following a CBD stent placement and retained stone. The patient is receiving low-dose neo and antibiotics, and has been initiated on CVVH for acute renal failure. The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload and possible VAP, making it difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and the WBC count is drifting back up. Repeat blood and urine cultures have been sent, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient may still be at risk for further complications, such as organ failure or death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is secondary to ATN, and the patient is receiving CVVH. However, the patient's nutritional status is poor, and the patient may not be able to tolerate the removal of volume, which could lead to further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload and possible VAP, making it difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. The patient may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as ARDS or pneumothorax.
4. Altered Nutritional Status: The patient is tolerating tube feeds without residuals, but the patient's nutritional status is still altered. The patient may be at risk for malnutrition and related complications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is following simple commands intermittently, but the patient's mental status is still altered. The patient may be at risk for further cognitive decline or delirium.
6. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is being treated with amiodarone, but the patient may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the presence of central lines and the patient's critical illness.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to the presence of central lines and the patient's respiratory status.
10. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to the presence of central lines and the patient's compromised immune system.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and at risk for a variety of medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 17.4
* Hct: 28.4
* Plt: 193
* Cr: 2.0
* TCO2: 21
* Glucose: 154
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 11.4/35.1/0.9, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 37/6/0.34, ALT/AST: 18/20, Alk Phos/T Bili: 238/2.2, Amylase/Lipase: 34/27, Differential-Neuts: 89.0%, Band: 3.0%, Lymph: 4.0%, Mono: 1.0%, Eos: 1.0%, Fibrinogen: 514 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.2 mmol/L, Albumin: 1.8 g/dL, LDH: 336 IU/L, Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

1. Septic shock: E. coli and VRE bacteremia, likely source is cholangitis, requiring antibiotics and CVVH.
2. Respiratory failure: Hypoxic and hypercapneic, requiring mechanical ventilation and daily SBTs.
3. Anuric: Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes, requiring CVVH and renal dose medications.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: Low albumin, poor coags, and mildly elevated ammonia, possibility of cirrhosis.
5. Coagulopathy: Responded to vitamin K, likely related to liver dysfunction and septic shock.
6. Demand ischemia: Trop I trended down at OSH, then elevated again in setting of recent SVTs.
7. COPD: Serial CXR, nebulizers prn, and continued Advair.
8. Schizophrenia: Continued home antipsychotics and held neurontin for now.
9. DM2: Insulin SS.
10. Gastritis/PUD: Continued protonix.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Anuric and potential need for chronic dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy and potential need for liver transplantation.
5. Coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications.
6. Demand ischemia and potential cardiac complications.
7. COPD exacerbation and potential respiratory failure.
8. Schizophrenia and potential mental status changes.
9. DM2 and potential hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
10. Gastritis/PUD and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations for further management include:

1. Continue antibiotics and CVVH for septic shock.
2. Monitor respiratory function and adjust mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue CVVH and renal dose medications for anuric.
4. Monitor liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
5. Monitor coagulation status and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Monitor cardiac function and consider cardiology consult if necessary.
7. Continue COPD treatment and monitor for exacerbation.
8. Continue schizophrenia treatment and monitor for mental status changes.
9. Continue DM2 treatment and monitor for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
10. Continue gastritis/PUD treatment and monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with biliary sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure. They are intubated and sedated, with a history of encephalopathy. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and linezolid. They have a central venous catheter, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/49 mmHg. Their respiratory status is being supported with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation, with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's biliary sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased oxygen requirements, respiratory acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Septic shock: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock, leading to cardiovascular collapse and potentially fatal outcomes.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria/anuria may indicate acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis and potentially impact the patient's overall prognosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's altered mental status and encephalopathy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of sepsis.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation may increase the risk of VAP, which can lead to secondary infections and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. DVT/PE: The patient's immobility and central venous catheter may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Infection control issues: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection control issues, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - add on diff
   - consider ID consult
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - cont home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix
   .
   # FEN:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted with biliary sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and ventilated, with a respiratory failure diagnosis. She has a history of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS).
* Cardiovascular: The patient has shock, septic, with a diagnosis of E. coli and VRE bacteremia. She requires vasopressors and has had multiple hypotensive episodes.
* Renal: The patient is anuric, with a suspect diagnosis of ischemic ATN. She has had recent creatinine bumps and is on CVVH.
* Hepatic: The patient has cholestatic LFTs with GNR and GPC bacteremia. She has a history of cirrhosis possibility, but this has been ruled out by ultrasound.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which responded to vitamin K. This may be related to liver dysfunction, but overall dysfunction is likely due to septic shock and possible low-grade DIC.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, likely multifactorial, with toxic metabolic changes, retained sedatives, and hypercapnea.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has gastritis/PUD and is on pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular failure
* Renal failure, which may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Hepatic failure, which may lead to encephalopathy and coagulopathy
* Respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation and may be complicated by pneumonia
* Cardiovascular instability, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
* Neurological deterioration, which may lead to coma or death
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be complicated by coagulopathy
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and bacteremia

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue linezolid and broad-spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative rod coverage
* Send C. difficile stool test and consider Flagyl if decompensates
* Trend LFTs daily and consider ID consult
* Add on dif and consider cholecystectomy when stable
* Continue CVVH and consider transitioning to oral medications
* Manage respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and consider extubation when stable
* Monitor for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction and adjust treatment accordingly
* Consider ID consult for further management of sepsis and bacteremia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, now slightly trending up
   again after improvement on linezolid.  Having loose stool despite
   holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to maintain pressures, but
   tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - add on diff
   - consider ID consult
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia. She was admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has severe sepsis-induced respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. She has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 230, indicating severe hypoxemia.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has septic shock, requiring vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including SVT, and is currently receiving amiodarone.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with anuria, suspected to be due to ischemic ATN. She is receiving CVVH and has a muddy brown cast on her urine sediment.
* Hepatic: The patient has cholestatic liver dysfunction, with elevated LFTs and bilirubin. She has a history of cirrhosis, but a recent abdominal ultrasound did not confirm this diagnosis.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which responded to vitamin K, but may be related to liver dysfunction or septic shock.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status (AMS), likely due to a combination of factors, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy, retained sedatives, and hypercapnea.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest
* Renal failure, leading to the need for dialysis
* Hepatic failure, leading to encephalopathy and coagulopathy
* Neurological deterioration, including seizures or coma
* Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure

The patient's management plan includes:

* Continuing vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Adjusting mechanical ventilation to optimize oxygenation and ventilation
* Monitoring renal function and adjusting CVVH as needed
* Managing coagulopathy with vitamin K and platelet transfusions as needed
* Treating AMS with sedatives and analgesics as needed
* Monitoring for signs of hepatic failure and coagulopathy
* Considering an ID consult to optimize antibiotic therapy
* Planning for cholecystectomy when the patient is stable
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and adjusting therapy as needed

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is uncertain at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and a recent diagnosis of biliary sepsis/hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and has undergone several interventions, including endotracheal intubation, vasopressor therapy, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She has also received various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and sedatives.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently receiving vasopressor therapy to maintain blood pressure.
* Renal status: The patient is anuric and has a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI).
* Hepatic status: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is at risk for hepatic dysfunction.
* Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status (AMS) and is at risk for delirium.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that is likely related to liver dysfunction and septic shock.
* Other: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is currently receiving antipsychotic medication.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but may require further respiratory support or extubation in the future.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently receiving vasopressor therapy, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.
* Renal failure: The patient is anuric and has a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, indicating AKI. Further decline in renal function may occur.
* Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is at risk for hepatic dysfunction, which may worsen her overall condition.
* Neurological complications: The patient has AMS and is at risk for delirium, which may worsen her neurological status.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of biliary sepsis and may be at risk for further infection.
* Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of septic shock and may be at risk for further sepsis.

 ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient has been
   20L positive since admission due to aggressive rescuscitation for
   sepsis. Currently pt is significantly volume overloaded, and this AM
   CXR shows worsening fluid overload. Fortunately, pt
s respiratory
   status is stable only requiring FiO2 of 50%. Nonetheless, pt would
   likely improve significantly in terms of respiratory status and in
   general after diuresis.
   - Aim for goal negative 200cc/hr via CVVH
   - Wean off neosynephrine as BPs allow but would prioritize diuresis
   over weaning pressors
   - Wean off ventilators to goal PIP/PEEP of [**5-6**] and as pt tolerates
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   - Wean to 5/5 per above.
   - If pt becomes agitated would favor propofol over fentanyl/midazolam.
   If forced to use midazolam/fentanyl would use in boluses rather than
   drip.
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   -Will consider antipsychotics if pt becomes delirious given strong
   psych history
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - Continue PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at 200
   mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.
   .
   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn
   - cont. Advair
   .
   # Schizophrenia:
   - cont home antipsychotics
   - hold neurontin for now given mental status
   .
   #  DM2
   - insulin SS
   .
   #  Gastritis/PUD
   - cont. protonix
   .
   # FEN: Continue tube feeds
   # PPx:  pneumoboots and SC heparin, bowel regimen, pantoprazole

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient has been
   20L positive since admission due to aggressive rescuscitation for
   sepsis. Currently pt is significantly volume overloaded, and this AM
   CXR shows worsening fluid overload. Fortunately, pt
s respiratory
   status is stable only requiring FiO2 of 50%. Nonetheless, pt would
   likely improve significantly in terms of respiratory status and in
   general after diuresis.
   - Aim for goal negative 200cc/hr via CVVH
   - Wean off neosynephrine as BPs allow but would prioritize diuresis
   over weaning pressors
   - Wean off ventilators to goal PIP/PEEP of [**5-6**] and as pt tolerates
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   - Wean to 5/5 per above.
   - If pt becomes agitated would favor propofol over fentanyl/midazolam.
   If forced to use midazolam/fentanyl would use in boluses rather than
   drip.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), schizophrenia, and gastritis/PUD. She was admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and oliguria/anuria. She has been treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and diuresis, and has undergone percutaneous drain placement for cholangitis.

Current status:

* The patient is sedated and intubated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3.
* She has a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 71 beats per minute (bpm), and a blood pressure of 113/49 mmHg.
* Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* She has a white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.4 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 193 x 10^9/L, and a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL.
* Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with a bilirubin level of 2.2 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 238 IU/L.
* She has a hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis, which has nearly resolved with treatment.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome)
* Pneumonia
* Cholangitis
* Cholecystitis
* Pancreatitis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Renal failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis-induced encephalopathy
* Hypoxia
* Hypercapnea
* Acidosis
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Coagulopathy
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hepatorenal syndrome

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's septic shock is likely related to E. coli and VRE bacteremia.
* She has been treated with antibiotics and diuresis, and has undergone percutaneous drain placement for cholangitis.
* She requires continued treatment with antibiotics, diuresis, and close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results.
* She may require further interventions, such as cholecystectomy, to treat her underlying condition.
* She should be monitored for signs of sepsis-related organ dysfunction and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with antipsychotics if she becomes delirious, given her history of schizophrenia.
* She should be monitored for signs of hepatic dysfunction and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
* She should be monitored for signs of respiratory failure and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections.
* She should be monitored for signs of cardiac arrest and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with anticonvulsants if she develops seizures.
* She should be monitored for signs of electrolyte imbalance and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with antihypertensives if her blood pressure is elevated.
* She should be monitored for signs of coagulopathy and treated accordingly.
* She should be treated with anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, COPD, diabetes, and schizophrenia who was admitted with biliary sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and diuresis with CVVH. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, oliguria/anuria, respiratory failure, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and she has a history of cirrhosis, which is a possibility.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that responded to vitamin K, which may be related to liver dysfunction or septic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has anuric kidney failure with muddy brown casts on urine sediment, which may be due to ischemic ATN or sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has had episodes of tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, which may be related to sepsis or underlying cardiac disease.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastritis and PUD, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Sepsis-induced encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis-induced encephalopathy.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis that is nearly resolved with d5 and bicarb.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes and is at risk for hyperglycemia.
10. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk for developing pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and diuresis with CVVH to manage septic shock and oliguria/anuria.
2. Monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies to assess for hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy.
3. Continue respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
4. Manage cardiovascular instability with vasopressors and monitor for signs of cardiac failure.
5. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and manage with proton pump inhibitors and antacids.
6. Continue insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia.
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis-induced encephalopathy and manage with sedatives and antibiotics.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia.
9. Consider transition to oral amiodarone to manage atrial fibrillation.
10. Consider transition to CCB if able to taper off pressors."

   A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2,
   schizophrenia who presented with gram-negative sepsis, requiring
   vasopressors, now found to have increasing LFTs in a cholestatic
   pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.
   .
   # Septic Shock:  E. coli and now VRE bacteremia.  Most likely source is
   cholangitis.  s/p percut drain placement, still unable to remove large
   gallstones. White count cont to be elevated, fortunately trending down.
   Having loose stool despite holding lactulose. Still requiring neo to
   maintain pressures, but tolerating diuresis with CVVH. Afebrile on
   CVVH.
   - cont linezolide d3/14
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] for broad gram negative rod coverage
   - send C. dif given loose stool and increased leukocytosis
   - consider Flagyl if decompensates
   - send fungal markers
   - trend LFTs daily
   - cholecystectomy when stable
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]
increased abdominal girth.
  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   .
   # Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis
 Nearly resolved with d5
   and bicarb, better treatment of infection
   .
   #AMS:  Likely multifactorial with toxic metabolic in the setting of
   sepsis, retained sedatives in the setting of renal and hepatic faillure
   and hypercapnea in the setting of respiratory faillure,  also with
   elevated ammonia concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.
   -Head CT WNL
   -treat underlying causes as noted elsewhere
   .
   #Anuric [**Last Name (un) **]:  Suspect ischemic ATN with multiple hypotensive episodes
   at OSH requiring pressors and again at ERCP on the 26^th.  Had recent
   creatinine bump at OSH that had been trending down.  Muddy brown casts
   on urine sediment. Started CVVH yesterday, tolerated neg balance with
   Neo.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - UF 50cc negative/hr as tolerated
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #  SVT- likely AVRT/AVNRT in morning, response to vagal maneuver.  H/O
   MAT.  Recurrent episode of AVRT/AVNRT in evening, with subsequent a.
   flutter noted following adenosine.  Evidence of MAT on repeat ECG.
   Completed IV amio load. On Neo, avoid Levo given SVT.
   - transition to PO amiodarone given tolerating tube feeds now, start at
   200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - if able to taper off pressors, consider transitioning to CCB
   .
   # ?hepatic dysfunction: Patient with low albumin, poor coags, physical
   stigmata of telangectasia
s and palmar erythema, and a mildly elevated
   amonia of 65, cirrhosis is a possiblity.  Not mentioned on RUQ u/s at
   OSH.  Repeat abdominal u/s shows no evidence of cirrhosis by report.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to liver dysfunction but coagulopathy
   responded to vitamin K.  Overall dysfunction likely [**2-3**]  septic shock
   and possible low grade DIC.  No active hemorrhage.
   .
   # Demand ischemia:  Trop I had trended down at OSH.  Trop elevated
   again in setting of recent SVTs then trended down.

   # COPD:
   - serial CXR
   - nebulizers prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of CHF, COPD, DM2, and schizophrenia who was admitted with gram-negative sepsis, requiring vasopressors, and now has increasing LFTs in a cholestatic pattern with GNR and GPC bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Septic shock due to E. coli and VRE bacteremia, likely caused by cholangitis.
2. Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
3. Hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Hyperchloremic, non-gap metabolic acidosis, which has nearly resolved with d5 and bicarb.
5. Altered mental status (AMS) likely due to multifactorial causes, including toxic metabolic encephalopathy, retained sedatives, and hypercapnea.
6. Anuric kidney failure, suspected to be ischemic ATN due to multiple hypotensive episodes and recent creatinine bump.
7. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) likely due to atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT) or atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT).
8. Coagulopathy likely due to liver dysfunction and possible low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
9. Hepatic dysfunction, with low albumin, poor coagulation, and physical stigmata of telangiectasia and palmar erythema, but no evidence of cirrhosis on repeat abdominal ultrasound.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued sepsis and septic shock, potentially leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Development of liver failure or cirrhosis.
4. Recurrent episodes of SVT or atrial fibrillation, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
5. Worsening of respiratory failure, potentially leading to respiratory arrest or failure.
6. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and potential liver dysfunction.
7. Development of hepatic encephalopathy or ascites.
8. Complications related to the presence of a dialysis catheter, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or catheter occlusion.
9. Potential for medication interactions or side effects due to the patient's complex medical history and polypharmacy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative sepsis.
2. Daily SBTs to assess respiratory function.
3. Treatment of underlying causes of AMS, including hypercapnea, sepsis, and possible hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Renal replacement therapy with CVVH to manage anuric kidney failure.
5. Anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K to manage coagulopathy.
6. Cardiac monitoring and management of SVT.
7. Pulmonary care, including nebulizers and Advair, to manage COPD.
8. Management of DM2 with insulin and other medications.
9. Gastritis/PUD management with protonix and other medications.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently unknown."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of dementia and schizophrenia, admitted with biliary sepsis, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/40 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 17 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 193 K/uL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 18 IU/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 22 IU/L. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 11.5 seconds and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0.

The patient's imaging studies show a normal head computed tomography (CT) scan, and an abdominal ultrasound (US) shows no evidence of cirrhosis.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Anemia: Microcytic, with a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
2. Shock, septic: Biliary sepsis from a retained stone, treated with antibiotics and vasopressors.
3. Oliguria/anuria: Suspected ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN), treated with CVVH.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: Plan to extubate today, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a PIP of 17 cmH2O.
5. Tachycardia, other: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), treated with amiodarone.
6. Heart failure, diastolic, acute on chronic: Ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, stable.
7. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial, with possible toxic metabolic encephalopathy, sedative retention, and hypercapnea.
8. Hepatic dysfunction: Possible cirrhosis, with low albumin and poor coagulation.
9. Coagulopathy: Responded to vitamin K, possibly related to liver dysfunction.
10. COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a plan for serial chest X-rays, nebulizers as needed, and continued Advair therapy.
11. DM2: Diabetes mellitus type 2, treated with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of liver function, leading to worsening coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
2. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of existing AKI, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Respiratory failure, leading to increased risk of respiratory arrest.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying cardiac disease.
5. Sepsis-related encephalopathy, leading to worsening altered mental status.
6. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction.
7. Worsening of anemia, leading to increased risk of bleeding and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and coagulopathy.
9. Worsening of COPD, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure and pneumonia.
10. Development of complications related to CVVH, including bleeding, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient has been
   20L positive since admission due to aggressive rescuscitation for
   sepsis. Currently pt is significantly volume overloaded, and this AM
   CXR shows worsening fluid overload. Fortunately, pt
s respiratory
   status is stable only requiring FiO2 of 50%. Nonetheless, pt would
   likely improve significantly in terms of respiratory status and in
   general after diuresis.
   - Aim for goal negative 200cc/hr via CVVH
   - Wean off neosynephrine as BPs allow but would prioritize diuresis
   over weaning pressors
   - Wean off ventilators to goal PIP/PEEP of [**5-6**] and as pt tolerates
   - Consider extubation tomorrow after SBT
   #Hypoxic and Hypercapneic respiratory faillure:  Patient was electively
   intubated for ERCP [**2-3**]

  She returned to
   the floor intubated, somnolent.  It is unclear what was used to sedate
   her for the procedure, however she remained somnolent on the floor and,
   on [**5-6**], after several hours was noted to have
air hunger,
 at this
   time an ABG was checked which revealed acidemia and hypercapnea.  Did
   well on PSV trial, however overall severe sepsis makes extubation now
   less of a priority.
    - daily SBTs
   - Wean to 5/5 per above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with cholangitis, sepsis, and septic shock. She has a history of schizophrenia, diabetes, gastritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. She has been receiving antibiotics and has had a percutaneous drain placed to manage her biliary sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and has a central venous catheter for monitoring central venous pressure.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Renal function: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
* Liver function: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is at risk for liver failure.
* Coagulation: The patient has a coagulopathy that responded to vitamin K and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Liver failure
* Coagulopathy
* Neurological complications due to sepsis, such as altered mental status, seizures, or stroke
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, hypotension, or cardiac arrest
* Pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Infections, such as bacteremia or septicemia

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued antibiotics to manage sepsis
* Vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function
* CVVH to manage AKI
* Vitamin K to manage coagulopathy
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding or liver failure
* Consideration of antipsychotics to manage altered mental status
* Serial CXRs to monitor for signs of pneumonia or ARDS
* Nebulizers and bronchodilators to manage COPD
* Tube feeds to maintain nutrition
* Proton pump inhibitors to manage gastritis and PUD
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding
* VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Anemia
* Septic shock
* Oliguria/anuria
* Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
* Tachycardia
* Heart failure (chronic)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued ICU care
* Nutrition support
* Glycemic control
* Monitoring of lines and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Code status: DNR/DNI

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   add the following points: 75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with
   biliary sepsis c/b septic shock, ARF, has PCT biliary drain, amio for
   SVT. Was off pressors, now with low dose neo restarted to allow CVVH
   volume removal. Transfused 1 unit prbcs. Tolerating well PS/SBT.

   Labs notable for WBC 11.1K, HCT 25, K+ 3.4, na 131 (133) , Cr 1.0.
   Agree with plan to manage E. coli / VRE biliary sepsis c/b MOSF with
   [**Last Name (un) 614**] / linezolid for 14d course.  Hemodynamics improving, thoughs still
   requiring low dose vasopressor to maintain SBP >100, MAP > 55, to
   tolerate volume removal. TTE rather unimpressive.  Continue w/ biliary
   drain to gravity. Surgery and GI following.  D/w GI plan for repeat
   attempt at stone extraction via ercp as pt continues to improve. ARF
   likely ischemic [**2-3**] sepsis, RD meds, f/u c renal team. For volume
   overload / ARF, continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300cc/h as long as
   neo <0.5.  Did well on SBT and is awake and follows simple commands.
   WIll move to extubate.  MS clearing, but not yet to baseline. Reassess
   post extubation. Consider resuming psych meds once able to take POs
   (noting possible interaction btw ssri and linezolid). SVT has responded
   to amio - continue. Appropriate hct bump post transfusion. Continue to
   monitor, on PPI. ICU: Sq hep, full code, HD line and CVL. Can d/c

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of biliary sepsis, septic shock, acute kidney injury (ARF), and respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation and hemodynamic support.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 11.1K
* Hemoglobin: 25%
* Platelet count: 160K
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mg/dL
* Electrolyte imbalances: potassium 3.4 mmol/L, sodium 131 mmol/L, calcium 7.0 mg/dL, magnesium 1.7 mg/dL, and phosphorus 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Anemia
* Septic shock
* Oliguria/anuria
* Respiratory failure
* Tachycardia
* Heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic)
* Altered mental status

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Management of E. coli/VRE biliary sepsis with meropenem and linezolid for 14 days
* Hemodynamic support with low-dose vasopressor to maintain systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg and mean arterial pressure >55 mmHg
* Continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300 cc/h as long as the patient requires vasopressor support
* Repeat attempt at stone extraction via ERCP as the patient continues to improve
* ARF likely due to ischemic sepsis, RD medications, and follow-up with the renal team
* Consider resuming psychotropic medications once the patient is able to take oral medications

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability due to septic shock and vasopressor dependence
* Renal failure due to continued ischemic sepsis and ARF
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive devices
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Psychiatric complications due to altered mental status and potential medication interactions

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with
   biliary sepsis c/b septic shock, ARF, has PCT biliary drain, amio for
   SVT. Was off pressors, now with low dose neo restarted to allow CVVH
   volume removal. Transfused 1 unit prbcs. Tolerating well PS/SBT.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.5 BP 120/40  HR 70  RR 20 with sat 100 on PSV
   [**10-6**] 0.5   7.40/43/140.   WD F, awake, alert, following simple
   commands. biliary drain. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 11.1K, HCT 25, K+ 3.4, na 131 (133) , Cr 1.0.
   Agree with plan to manage E. coli / VRE biliary sepsis c/b MOSF with
   [**Last Name (un) 614**] / linezolid for 14d course.  Hemodynamics improving, thoughs still
   requiring low dose vasopressor to maintain SBP >100, MAP > 55, to
   tolerate volume removal. TTE rather unimpressive.  Continue w/ biliary
   drain to gravity. Surgery and GI following.  D/w GI plan for repeat
   attempt at stone extraction via ercp as pt continues to improve. ARF
   likely ischemic [**2-3**] sepsis, RD meds, f/u c renal team. For volume
   overload / ARF, continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300cc/h as long as
   neo <0.5.  Did well on SBT and is awake and follows simple commands.
   WIll move to extubate.  MS clearing, but not yet to baseline. Reassess
   post extubation. Consider resuming psych meds once able to take POs
   (noting possible interaction btw ssri and linezolid). SVT has responded
   to amio - continue. Appropriate hct bump post transfusion. Continue to
   monitor, on PPI. ICU: Sq hep, full code, HD line and CVL. Can d/c
   a-line post extubation. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with
   biliary sepsis c/b septic shock, ARF, has PCT biliary drain, amio for
   SVT. Was off pressors, now with low dose neo restarted to allow CVVH
   volume removal. Transfused 1 unit prbcs. Tolerating well PS/SBT.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.5 BP 120/40  HR 70  RR 20 with sat 100 on PSV
   [**10-6**] 0.5   7.40/43/140.   WD F, awake, alert, following simple
   commands. biliary drain. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. 3+ edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 11.1K, HCT 25, K+ 3.4, na 131 (133) , Cr 1.0.
   Agree with plan to manage E. coli / VRE biliary sepsis c/b MOSF with
   [**Last Name (un) 614**] / linezolid for 14d course.  Hemodynamics improving, thoughs still
   requiring low dose vasopressor to maintain SBP >100, MAP > 55, to
   tolerate volume removal. TTE rather unimpressive.  Continue w/ biliary
   drain to gravity. Surgery and GI following.  D/w GI plan for repeat
   attempt at stone extraction via ercp as pt continues to improve. ARF
   likely ischemic [**2-3**] sepsis, RD meds, f/u c renal team. For volume
   overload / ARF, continue CVVH to remove volume 200-300cc/h as long as
   neo <0.5.  Did well on SBT and is awake and follows simple commands.
   WIll move to extubate.  MS clearing, but not yet to baseline. Reassess
   post extubation. Consider resuming psych meds once able to take POs
   (noting possible interaction btw ssri and linezolid). SVT has responded
   to amio - continue. Appropriate hct bump post transfusion. Continue to
   monitor, on PPI. ICU: Sq hep, full code, HD line and CVL. Can d/c
   a-line post extubation. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, and biliary sepsis, who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She has undergone invasive ventilation, transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face mask.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.1 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 7.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 160 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: potassium 3.4 mmol/L, sodium 131 mmol/L, and chloride 96 mmol/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase: 17 IU/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase: 22 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 184 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 1.7 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* LDH: 298 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia
* Hypotension
* Respiratory rate: 15-20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on a face mask
* Coarse breath sounds in the bilateral lung fields
* Soft and non-distended abdomen
* 3+ edema in the lower extremities

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Anemia
* Septic shock
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Respiratory failure
* Tachycardia
* Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Possible cirrhosis

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Continued septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* Progression of AKI to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation
* Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Increased risk of central nervous system complications, such as sepsis-induced encephalopathy and cerebral edema
* Possible development of liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and potential complications, close monitoring and management by the ICU team are essential to prevent further deterioration and improve outcomes."

   shock, ARF, improving on antibiotics, with PCT biliary drain, on CVVH
   and amio for SVT.
Bilary sepsis c/b retained stone: Improvement in cholestatic rise of
   LFTs. Patient has been followed by GI and Surgery, who are deferring
   further intervention for stone removal at this time.  Patient will need
   outpatient followup.  PTC drain currently in place.
   - Per ERCP: at this time will defer stone removal within the next two
   months
   - Per surgery: will keep as an external drain and possibly drain study
   at later date.  Patient is high risk intraoperative candidate, so drain
   conversion to internal drain and ccy will be defered at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   75F dementia / schizophrenia admitted with biliary sepsis c/b septic
   shock, ARF, improving on antibiotics, with PCT biliary drain, on CVVH
   and amio for SVT.
Bilary sepsis c/b retained stone: Improvement in cholestatic rise of
   LFTs. Patient has been followed by GI and Surgery, who are deferring
   further intervention for stone removal at this time.  Patient will need
   outpatient followup.  PTC drain currently in place.
   - Per ERCP: at this time will defer stone removal within the next two
   months
   - Per surgery: will keep as an external drain and possibly drain study
   at later date.  Patient is high risk intraoperative candidate, so drain
   conversion to internal drain and ccy will be defered at this time.
   .
 ANEMIA: Microcytic, h/o PUD.
   - On [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - Hct stable
   - Guaic stools
   - Active T/S
   - Transfuse hct<21
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: [**2-3**] biliary sepsis from retained stone. Stone unable
   to be removed by ERCP. On Meropenem and Linezolid.  Currently on day 6
   of linezolid for VRE and day 8 of meropenem for E coli bacteremia.
   Repeat blood cx have had no growth to date.
   - C Diff negative, d/c flagyl
   - Fungal culture negative
   - Continue linezolid/meropenem for total 14 day course; can be dosed w/
   HD (see below)
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA: Patient remains anuric, likely secondary to ATN in
   the setting of sepsis and poor forward flow.
   - Currently on CVVH
   - Will likely need HD, discuss with renal
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): s/p Extubation. Patient
   doing well.
   - Continue to monitor respiratory status
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER: SVT, now in NSR
   - Continue amio
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - EF 60%, stable
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Resolved. Likely multifactorial
   with toxic metabolic in the setting of sepsis, retained sedatives in
   the setting of renal and ?hepatic faillure and hypercapnea in the
   setting of respiratory faillure,  also with elevated ammonia concerning
   for hepatic encephalopathy. Head CT WNL

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of dementia, schizophrenia, and chronic heart failure, admitted with biliary sepsis, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. She was previously intubated and has now been extubated. She remains on invasive ventilation, but her respiratory status is improving. She has been diagnosed with anemia, shock, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental status. She has been treated with antibiotics, and her blood cultures have been negative. She is on CVVH and is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still on invasive ventilation. She may require further treatment to maintain her respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is improving, but she is still at risk for developing further complications, such as organ failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is microcytic, and she may require further treatment to address this issue.
4. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's oliguria/anuria is likely secondary to ATN in the setting of sepsis and poor forward flow. She may require further treatment to address this issue.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, and she may require further treatment to address this issue.
6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, particularly given her history of liver disease and her current condition.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has resolved, but she may still be at risk for developing further bleeding complications.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT, particularly given her immobility and her current condition.
9. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer, particularly given her history of PUD and her current condition.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP, particularly given her current condition and her use of invasive ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient remains in the ICU with ongoing medical management. The patient was extubated overnight and is currently off pressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/48 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula with an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 160 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104 mg/dL

The patient has ongoing medical issues, including:

* Anemia, other
* Septic shock
* Oliguria/anuria
* Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
* Tachycardia, other
* Heart failure, diastolic, acute on chronic
* Altered mental status (not delirium)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Right dialysis line and LIJ line in place
* Mild tenderness in the lower quadrant of the abdomen
* Trace edema

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Nasal cannula with an FiO2 of 50%
* Standby ventilator mode
* ABG results: pH 7.48, PaO2 226, PaCO2 34

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of septic shock
* Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Prolonged respiratory failure or need for mechanical ventilation
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias or worsening of heart failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count and international normalized ratio (INR) values
* Development of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is unclear. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address the patient's ongoing medical issues and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 96.6 kg male with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for septic shock, oliguria/anuria, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.1°C (95.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 111/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, indicating sepsis. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has a history of psychiatric disease, including schizophrenia and personality disorders.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, linezolid, and heparin sodium. The patient is receiving CVVH and HD, and is expected to undergo ERCP and stone removal at a later time.

The patient's physical examination is significant for mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with no signs of focal neurological deficits.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and hepatic failure.
2. Respiratory failure, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias, due to sepsis and chronic kidney disease.
4. Neurological complications, such as seizures and encephalopathy, due to sepsis and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and bowel obstruction, due to sepsis and abdominal tenderness.
6. Infectious complications, such as pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections, due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive devices.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his sepsis, kidney dysfunction, and respiratory failure to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 96.6 kg (134 lbs) female with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.1°C (95.1°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/48 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 99% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 4.7 K/uL and a C-reactive protein of 111 mg/dL. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with a total bilirubin of 7 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase of 198 IU/L. Her kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen of 26 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of dementia, schizophrenia, and peptic ulcer disease. She is currently receiving antibiotics and has been started on CVVH and amiodarone for SVT.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Anemia, microcytic, with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL
* Abdominal pain, which is mild and has been present previously
* Shock, septic, with a possible retained stone
* Liver function abnormalities, which are improving
* ARF/oliguria/anuria, which is likely secondary to ATN
* Respiratory failure, acute, with a possible need for HD
* Tachycardia, other, with a possible need for amiodarone
* Heart failure, diastolic, acute on chronic
* Altered mental status, not delirium, with a possible need for restart of Abilify and hold of SSRI
* Coagulopathy, which has resolved
* COPD, with a possible need for serial CXR, nebulizers, and restart of Advair
* DM2, with a possible need for insulin SS

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis-related organ failure, including ARF, respiratory failure, and liver failure
* Complications related to CVVH and amiodarone therapy, including hypotension and arrhythmias
* Complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, including dementia, schizophrenia, and peptic ulcer disease
* Complications related to the patient's medication regimen, including the possible need for restart of Abilify and hold of SSRI."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   - Per ERCP: at this time will defer stone removal within the next two
   months
   - Per surgery: will keep as an external drain and possibly drain study
   at later date.  Patient is high risk intraoperative candidate, so drain
   conversion to internal drain and ccy will be defered at this time.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. He was admitted with septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. He has a history of schizophrenia, dementia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently on antibiotics, vasopressors, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for sepsis and acute kidney injury. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 111/48 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's biliary sepsis is a potential source of further complications, including septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is a potential complication of sepsis and may require further management, including dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a potential complication of sepsis and may require further management, including mechanical ventilation.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's history of heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make him at risk for further cardiac complications.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver function tests (LFTs) suggest liver dysfunction, which may be a complication of sepsis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a potential complication of chronic kidney disease and may require further management, including transfusions.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, may require further management, including correction of electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors to manage sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for further complications.
3. Consider further management of acute kidney injury, including dialysis.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further management, including mechanical ventilation.
5. Manage the patient's liver dysfunction, including correction of electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider transfusions for anemia.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances and correct as necessary.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Nutrition: Provide adequate nutrition to support the patient's metabolic needs.
2. Glycemic Control: Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and manage hyperglycemia with insulin as necessary.
3. Lines: Monitor the patient's arterial and venous lines for patency and securement.
4. Prophylaxis: Provide prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis as necessary.
5. Stress Ulcer: Monitor the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and adjust as necessary.
6. VAP: Monitor the patient's ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis and adjust as necessary.
7. Code Status: The patient's code status is full code."
