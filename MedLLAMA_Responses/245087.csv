You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He was found to have left main disease and was medically managed overnight with heparin, nitroglycerin, aspirin, beta blocker, and statin. A cardiac catheterization revealed LMCA disease. The patient has a history of hypertension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and spinal stenosis. He also has a prior decubitus ulcer site on his right buttock.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 112/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination is notable for a 2+ edema bilaterally, 2+ DP pulses, and a 4x3cm tan discolorated area on his right buttock.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 129 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose of 89 mg/dL. His coagulation profile shows a PT of 13.6 seconds, PTT of 90.7 seconds, and INR of 1.2.

The patient's plan is to continue aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and statin. He will be monitored for signs of decompensation or persistent chest pain, and may require emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if necessary. The patient's anemia will be followed daily and transfused if his hemoglobin drops below 30. His thrombocytopenia will be monitored, and he will be started on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He was found to have left main disease on cardiac catheterization and likely suffered a right anterior cerebral artery (RACA) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) due to embolism. He was noted to have predominant left lower extremity (LLE) weakness and left upper extremity (LUE) weakness on examination. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58-60 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 102-153 mmHg. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 129 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's CVA may lead to cerebral edema, which can cause increased intracranial pressure and potentially worsen his condition.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of left main disease and CVA may increase his risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed left main disease, which may lead to cardiac complications such as angina, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of decubitus ulcer may increase his risk of developing an infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase his risk of bleeding complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low, which may increase his risk of developing anemia-related complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and history of lung nodules may increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease may increase his risk of developing renal failure.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely for signs of worsening cerebral edema or other neurological complications.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac disease with medications and monitor his cardiac function closely.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and hemoglobin level closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
6. Consider ordering a CT scan or MRI to further evaluate the patient's lung nodules and potential cardiac complications.
7. Consider ordering a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and potential cardiac complications.
8. Consider ordering a pulmonary function test to evaluate the patient's lung function and potential respiratory complications."

   Chief Complaint: 85 year-old man with a history of hypertension and
   coronary artery disease who presented with angina, transferred to the
   CCU after found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath no
   s/p stroke.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's neuro findings are improving.  He was able to move his
   left toes slightly and his left arm, although it is still weaker than
   the right side.  He seems to have some neglect - when you ask him to
   lift his arms, he will only lift his right arm until you ask him
   specifically to lift his left arm.  Neuro feels that he has completed
   his stoke and has no further recs regarding BP goals.  They rec
   warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off the heparin gtt and for
   him to f/u with them as an outpatient in 3 months.  He is cleared by
   neuro to get out of bed and work with PT.  His SBP were in the low
   100's after his lopressor so his dose was decreased to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   (from 25).  He was started on an integrellin gtt yesterday.  He was
   advanced to a cardiac diet.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] and the family discussed
   options regarding treatment for his coronary artery disease and decided
   to procede with medical management at this time and defer surgery given
   his recent stroke.

   2. Tiny small areas of slow diffusion in the right parietal, right
   medial occipital, left parietal and the left frontal regions indicate
   multiple small infarcts, which could be embolic in nature.
   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   somewhat throughout the day, however he still remains weaker on his
   left side.
   - Will aim for SBP > 130.
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Patient will need coumadin for at least 3 months given the embolic
   nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months.
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg (will decrease to 81 mg daily once his INR is
   therapeutic)
   - Will DC the heparin and integrellin gtts.
   - Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased as
   his HR has been in the 50
s to 60
s and his SBP in the low 100
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for his left main stem
   partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, however this is most likely due to venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - No diuresis for now given his low SBP.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib as this would change the length of treatment with coumadin.  If
   the patient is found to have a.fib, will need lifelong coumadin
   therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.
   - Skin care; if worsens, wound consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 85 year-old man with a history of hypertension and
   coronary artery disease who presented with angina, transferred to the
   CCU after found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath no
   s/p stroke.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's neuro findings are improving.  He was able to move his
   left toes slightly and his left arm, although it is still weaker than
   the right side.  He seems to have some neglect - when you ask him to
   lift his arms, he will only lift his right arm until you ask him
   specifically to lift his left arm.  Neuro feels that he has completed
   his stoke and has no further recs regarding BP goals.  They rec
   warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off the heparin gtt and for
   him to f/u with them as an outpatient in 3 months.  He is cleared by
   neuro to get out of bed and work with PT.  His SBP were in the low
   100's after his lopressor so his dose was decreased to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   (from 25).  He was started on an integrellin gtt yesterday.  He was
   advanced to a cardiac diet.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] and the family discussed
   options regarding treatment for his coronary artery disease and decided
   to procede with medical management at this time and defer surgery given
   his recent stroke.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, pain, or other complaints.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. He suffered a stroke, which has since been stabilized, and has been cleared to start physical therapy. He is currently being managed medically for his coronary artery disease and is being considered for future surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's left main coronary artery disease increases his risk of future cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's recent stroke increases his risk of future neurological events, such as hemorrhage or recurrent stroke.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, which increases his risk of bleeding complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is in the 130s-140s, which is low and may increase his risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent stroke may have affected his respiratory function, and he may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Infection complications: The patient's recent stroke may have increased his risk of infection, and he may be at risk for developing a secondary infection.
7. Skin complications: The patient has a history of decubitus ulcer and may be at risk for developing skin breakdown or infection.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but he may be at risk for developing anemia due to his recent blood loss and ongoing bleeding risk.
9. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, but he may be at risk for developing hypertension in the future.
10. Lung nodule: The patient has a lung nodule that requires further evaluation, and he may be at risk for developing lung cancer or other respiratory complications.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition and his nutritional status should be closely monitored.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient has multiple lines in place, which should be monitored for signs of infection or other complications.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, which should be continued as ordered.
5. Skin care: The patient's skin should be closely monitored for signs of breakdown or infection, and he should receive regular skin care to prevent decubitus ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   somewhat throughout the day, however he still remains weaker on his
   left side.
   - Will aim for SBP > 130.
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Patient will need coumadin for at least 3 months given the embolic
   nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months.
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg (will decrease to 81 mg daily once his INR is
   therapeutic)
   - Will DC the heparin and integrellin gtts.
   - Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased as
   his HR has been in the 50
s to 60
s and his SBP in the low 100
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for his left main stem
   partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, however this is most likely due to venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - No diuresis for now given his low SBP.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib as this would change the length of treatment with coumadin.  If
   the patient is found to have a.fib, will need lifelong coumadin
   therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 85 year-old man with a history of hypertension and
   coronary artery disease who presented with angina, transferred to the
   CCU after found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath no
   s/p stroke.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's neuro findings are improving.  He was able to move his
   left toes slightly and his left arm, although it is still weaker than
   the right side.  He seems to have some neglect - when you ask him to
   lift his arms, he will only lift his right arm until you ask him
   specifically to lift his left arm.  Neuro feels that he has completed
   his stoke and has no further recs regarding BP goals.  They rec
   warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off the heparin gtt and for
   him to f/u with them as an outpatient in 3 months.  He is cleared by
   neuro to get out of bed and work with PT.  His SBP were in the low
   100's after his lopressor so his dose was decreased to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   (from 25).  He was started on an integrellin gtt yesterday.  He was
   advanced to a cardiac diet.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] and the family discussed
   options regarding treatment for his coronary artery disease and decided
   to procede with medical management at this time and defer surgery given
   his recent stroke.
   This am the patient denies chest pain, SOB, pain, or other complaints.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath. He also had a recent stroke, with acute right anterior cerebral artery territorial infarct and multiple small infarcts in other regions, likely embolic in nature.

The patient's neurological findings are improving, with some left-sided neglect and weakness, but he is able to move his left toes and arm slightly. His blood pressure has been in the low 100's, and his dose of Lopressor was decreased to 12.5 mg. He was started on an integrellin gtt and advanced to a cardiac diet.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Thromboembolic complications: Given the patient's recent stroke and the presence of multiple small infarcts, there is a risk of further thromboembolic events.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the low 100's, and he may require further adjustments to his antihypertensive medications.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at 35.4, but he may require further evaluation and treatment for anemia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is in the 130s-140s, and he may require further monitoring and treatment for thrombocytopenia.
5. Spinal stenosis: The patient has a history of spinal stenosis and may require further evaluation and treatment for pain control.
6. Lung nodules: The patient has a lung nodule seen on CXR, and further evaluation with CT scan may be necessary.
7. Right buttock prior decub ulcer site: The patient has a prior decub ulcer site in his right buttock, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's current medications include:

* Lopressor 12.5 mg
* Metoprolol 6.25 mg
* ASA 325 mg
* Heparin gtt
* Integrellin gtt
* PPI daily
* Statin

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue ASA 325 mg and decrease to 81 mg daily once INR is therapeutic
* DC heparin and integrellin gtts
* Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg
* Continue high-dose statin
* Consider medical management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for left main stem partial blockage
* Wear compression stockings to decrease lower extremity edema
* Continue telemetry and monitor for atrial fibrillation
* Follow daily Hct and monitor for thrombocytopenia
* Pain control with acetaminophen for spinal stenosis
* Further evaluation and treatment for lung nodules and right buttock prior decub ulcer site."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 85 year-old man with a history of hypertension and
   coronary artery disease who presented with angina, transferred to the
   CCU after found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath no
   s/p stroke.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's neuro findings are improving.  He was able to move his
   left toes slightly and his left arm, although it is still weaker than
   the right side.  He seems to have some neglect - when you ask him to
   lift his arms, he will only lift his right arm until you ask him
   specifically to lift his left arm.  Neuro feels that he has completed
   his stoke and has no further recs regarding BP goals.  They rec
   warfarin for at least 3 months after he is off the heparin gtt and for
   him to f/u with them as an outpatient in 3 months.  He is cleared by
   neuro to get out of bed and work with PT.  His SBP were in the low
   100's after his lopressor so his dose was decreased to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   (from 25).  He was started on an integrellin gtt today which he is
   planned to stay on for until Monday.  He is still awaiting carotid US.
   He was advanced to a cardiac diet.  CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] sent an email to [**Doctor Last Name 2573**]
   stating that they would likely want to hold off in the setting of an
   acute stroke.  The family expressed concern about immediately proceding
   with surgery as well.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease on cath. He also suffered a stroke and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's neuro findings are improving, and he is able to move his left toes and arm, although his left arm is still weaker than his right. He has some neglect and is unable to lift his left arm unless specifically asked to do so. The neurologist has cleared him to get out of bed and work with physical therapy.

The patient's blood pressure has been stable in the low 100s, and his dose of Lopressor has been decreased to 12.5mg. He was started on an integrelin gtt today and is planned to stay on it until Monday. He is still awaiting carotid US.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's left main coronary artery disease and history of hypertension, he is at risk for further cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's stroke and ongoing neglect suggest that he may be at risk for further neurological complications such as seizures, brain edema, or cerebral vasospasm.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's pneumonia and ongoing respiratory support suggest that he may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Infection: The patient's recent stroke and ongoing immobility make him at risk for infection, particularly in the urinary tract or respiratory tract.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of hypertension and recent stroke make him at risk for thrombosis, particularly in the legs or lungs.
6. Anemia: The patient's recent blood loss and ongoing bleeding make him at risk for anemia, particularly if his blood loss is not adequately replaced.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's recent heparin therapy and ongoing bleeding make him at risk for thrombocytopenia, particularly if his platelet count is not adequately monitored.
8. Spinal stenosis: The patient's history of spinal stenosis and ongoing immobility make him at risk for further spinal stenosis complications, particularly if his pain is not adequately managed.

In terms of the patient's treatment plan, the following steps should be taken:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his Lopressor dose as necessary to maintain a blood pressure of 120-160mmHg.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to manage his symptoms.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his respiratory support as necessary to manage his symptoms.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his infection prevention measures as necessary to prevent infection.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent thrombosis.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia risk and adjust his blood transfusion therapy as necessary to manage his anemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia risk and adjust his platelet transfusion therapy as necessary to manage his thrombocytopenia.
8. Continue to manage the patient's spinal stenosis symptoms and adjust his pain management regimen as necessary to manage his pain."

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   significantly, however he still remains weaker on his left side.
   Carotid U/S scheduled for today
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Will start lovenox bridge to coumadin, pt will need coumadin for at
   least 3 months given the embolic nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months (appt already made).
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 81mg
   - Increase Metoprolol to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and up-tightrate as tolerated by
   BPs.
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Restart ACEI as tolerated by BPs, likely tomorrow.
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG for his left main stem partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, but JVP is 7.  Likely [**12-29**] venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - Gentle diuresis, 20mg IV lasix, for now and f/u lytes.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**] as this would change the length of treatment
   with coumadin.  If the patient is found to have a.fib, will need
   lifelong coumadin therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.
   - Skin care; if worsens, wound consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85M presenting with chest pain, found to have left main disease on
   cath, complicated by a Rt ACA CVA and multiple other small infarcts,
   likely embolic.
   # CVA.  Likely embolic secondary to plaque embolus from his aorta
   during the cardiac cath.  Official MRI reports show an acute Rt ACA
   infarct and multiple small infarcts in his right parietal, right medial
   occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions.  Neuro feels that
   he has completed his stroke.  His left-sided hemiparesis has improved
   somewhat throughout the day, however he still remains weaker on his
   left side.
   - Will aim for SBP > 130.
   - F/u carotid U/S read.
   - BG < 150, HISS
   - Appreciate neuro recs, will f/u.
   - PT/OT
   - Patient will need coumadin for at least 3 months given the embolic
   nature of his stoke.
   - Will have the patient patient f/u in the outpatient stroke clinic in
   3 months.
   # CORONARIES: He initially presented with concern for unstable angina
   and was ruled out by cardiac enzymes; ECG difficult to interpret in
   setting of LBBB.  Cardiac cath showed LMCA disease.   CABG was
   considered however given his recent stroke and the risk of open-heart
   surgery both the surgeons and the family feel it would be better to
   proceed with medical management at this time.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg (will decrease to 81 mg daily once his INR is
   therapeutic)
   - Will DC the heparin and integrellin gtts.
   - Continue Metoprolol at a smaller dose of 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (decreased as
   his HR has been in the 50
s to 60
s and his SBP in the low 100
   - Continue high dose statin
   - Once he recovers from the acute event, can consider continue medical
   management vs CABG vs cath with stent placement for his left main stem
   partial blockage.
   # PUMP: Echo with low-normal EF 50-55% and LVH.  Patient with lower
   extremity edema on exam, however this is most likely due to venous
   insufficiency.
   - Will have the patient wear compression stockings to decrease his
   lower extremity edema.
   - No diuresis for now given his low SBP.
   # RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia on telemetry, however the patient has a
   reported history of PAF (patient denies).
   - Continue telemetry.
   - Patient with need 2 week long monitor as an outpatient to monitor for
   a.fib as this would change the length of treatment with coumadin.  If
   the patient is found to have a.fib, will need lifelong coumadin
   therapy.
   # ANEMIA: Hct stable today at 35.4
   - Follow daily Hct
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA: 130s-140s. Low before heparin.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # SPINAL STENOSIS:
   - Pain control with acetaminophen
   # HYPERTENSION:  Patient currently having low SBP
   - Holding  ACE, CCB,
   - continue decreased dose of Metoprolol as above.
   # LUNG NODULE: Seen on CXR as incidental finding, no priors for
   comparison.
   - Will need CT for further eval but will hold off for now, will need
   f/u as OP.
   # RIGHT BUTTOCK PRIOR DECUB ULCER SITE: Patient reports this is site of
   prior decub which occured during hip fracture surgery.  Per his report,
   was difficult to heal.
   - Skin care; if worsens, wound consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with angina and was found to have left main coronary artery disease on catheterization. He had a stroke and multiple small infarcts, likely embolic in nature.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: BP 139/55 mmHg, HR 66 bpm, RR 20 insp/min, SpO2 96%
* Heart rhythm: First-degree AV block
* Neurological examination: Left-sided hemiparesis, some left-sided neglect, CN II-XII intact
* Labs: WBC 7.9 K/uL, Hct 34.8%, Plt 130 K/uL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, TropT 0.06 ng/mL, Glucose 122 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: MRI shows acute Rt ACA infarct and multiple small infarcts in right parietal, right medial occipital, left parietal, and left frontal regions

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Given the patient's history of hypertension and recent stroke, he may be at risk for hemodynamic instability, particularly if his blood pressure drops further.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and history of stroke. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and pneumatic compression devices should be continued.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of stroke and immobility increases his risk for pulmonary embolism. Monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and chest pain, is essential.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions increase his risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, such as tachypnea, hypoxia, and hypercapnia, is essential.
5. Infection: The patient's history of stroke and immobility increases his risk for infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and changes in mental status, is essential.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of stroke and use of anticoagulant therapy increase his risk for bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as petechiae, ecchymosis, and hematuria, is essential.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent stroke increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of stroke and immobility increase his risk for neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cerebral edema.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and treat any complications that may arise."
