   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, ruled out for PE.
   .
   #Acute episodes of dyspnea with EKG changes and elevated PA pressure
   -unclear etiology at this time possibly due to acute coronary artery
   occlusion that lysed prior to cath vs pulmonary embolus.  No evidence
   of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath.  Other possibility could
   be CHF although wedge only 15.  Atrial fibrillation possibly seen at
   OSH, however not documented, which could explain dyspnea, as well as
   other tachyarrhythmia, no evidence of this so far.  Primary pulmonary
   process possible including pneumonia.   Also must consider myocarditis
   or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may be consistent with this
   diagnosis.
   - CTA negative for PE
   - Lower extremitiy venous duplex negative for DVT
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Serial ekg's
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram shows right atrial clot
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry

   # Elevated CK: At this time etiology of elevated CK is unknown. CKMB
   not elevated so is not cardiac in origin. Other possible etiologies
   include Seizure or cerebral infarct, Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis,
   Inflammatory myositis, Infection, medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH pending
   - Consider Neuro Consult
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with acute episodes of dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. The patient's condition is uncertain, with possible etiologies including acute coronary artery occlusion, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, or primary pulmonary process.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which are unclear in origin. Other possible etiologies include seizure, cerebral infarct, hypothyroidism, viral myositis, inflammatory myositis, infection, or medication-related.

The patient has a history of pneumonia, treated with levaquin, and reports a possible left-sided infiltrate on CXR. The patient received one dose of ceftriaxone at the rehab facility and one dose of levaquin in the ED. A urine and blood culture are pending, and the patient is not currently receiving antibiotics.

The patient's neuro examination shows mild gait changes, possibly related to a 2-week-old CVA, but no other lasting deficits. The patient's daughter reports some changes over the past two weeks, including a weak voice and overall weakness, possibly with slurred speech.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending upwards, and the patient is receiving heparin for a clot in the right atrium. The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently sinus tachycardia, and the patient is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with oxygen being provided as needed. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and the patient is receiving gentle hydration due to acute renal failure (ARF) and contrast administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: Given the patient's history of elevated PA pressure and the presence of a clot in the right atrium, cardiac tamponade is a possible complication.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of a clot in the right atrium suggest that pulmonary embolism is a possible complication.
3. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's history of elevated PA pressure and the presence of a clot in the right atrium suggest that acute coronary syndrome is a possible complication.
4. Myocarditis or myopericarditis: The patient's EKG changes may be consistent with this diagnosis.
5. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of a clot in the right atrium suggest that infection is a possible complication.
6. ARF: The patient's history of contrast administration and the presence of ARF suggest that further renal damage is a possible complication.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's history of CVA and the presence of mild gait changes suggest that neurological deterioration is a possible complication.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of a clot in the right atrium suggest that respiratory failure is a possible complication.

Given the patient's complex medical history and uncertain condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these potential complications and optimize the patient's care."

   - BCx/UCx
   - Head CT - layering high density in left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 758**], probably
   representing tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. No definite
   parenchymal or subdural hematoma.  Asymmetry of lateral ventricles with
   enlargement of right lateral ventricle likely chronic.  Extensive
   periventriculr white matter hypodensity [**2-14**] microangiopathic ischemic
   changes.  No evidence of acute large vascular territory infarction or
   shift of midline structures.  Could get MRI w/ diffusion weighted
   imaging
   - Chest CT - neg for PE (unable to assess lower lungs but no big
   embolus)
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] - Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
   systolic function. Right ventricular dilation, moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a probable mass in the right atrium. Discussed
   with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Lower ext u/s: No DVT in both lower extremities
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation..even though CT scan negative for PE, cannot rule out b/c
   of [**Known lastname **] and clinical findings. Patient stable.
   .
   #Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath, or
   PE/DVT onCT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   ----Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has PE -> cannot
   rule out Malignancy
   Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible including
   pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
    Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro)
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - BNP today for further risk stratification
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   -Consider V/Q scan for possible definitive diagnosis of PE as patient
   in intermediate probability category
   -Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile
   - Urine cx/ua pending
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Attempt to attain records from [**Doctor Last Name 645**]
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily

   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LV EF with normal PCWP
   -   Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Imaging studies, including a head CT and chest CT, revealed a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage and a probable mass in the right atrium. The patient was found to have a right atrial clot and was started on heparin therapy. She also has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, leukocytosis, and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a high probability of PE. However, the etiology is unclear, and further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Intracranial Hemorrhage: The patient's head CT shows a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, which may be a sign of bleeding into the brain.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac involvement. The possibility of myocarditis or myopericarditis should be considered.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is at risk for acute renal failure due to her underlying medical conditions and potential nephrotoxic medications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory acidosis suggest respiratory failure, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or the PE.
6. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may be related to her underlying medical conditions, dehydration, or the PE.
7. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated CK levels suggest the possibility of an infection, which should be investigated further.

Plan:

1. Continue heparin therapy to treat the suspected PE.
2. Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes in the intraventricular hemorrhage.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider a formal neuro consult if the scan shows progression.
4. Trend the patient's CK levels to assess for etiology and consider further testing, such as a viral myositis panel.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further testing, such as a fractional excretion of urea, to assess for acute renal failure.
7. Consider a V/Q scan to further evaluate the patient's pulmonary embolism.
8. Monitor the patient's metabolic alkalosis and consider further testing, such as an arterial blood gas, to assess for underlying acid-base disorders.
9. Consider a formal neuro consult to evaluate the patient's suspected CVA and potential neurologic complications.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust the plan as necessary to ensure her comfort and safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation..even though CT scan negative for PE, cannot rule out b/c
   of [**Known lastname **] and clinical findings. Patient stable.
   .
   #Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath, or
   PE/DVT onCT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   ----Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has PE -> cannot
   rule out Malignancy
   Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible including
   pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
    Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro)
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   -
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   -Consider V/Q scan for possible definitive diagnosis of PE as patient
   in intermediate probability category
   -Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK

   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   #Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters

   Disposition: ICU/ Social work consult pending<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and a diagnosis of probable pulmonary embolism (PE) based on clinical findings and a CT scan.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, tachypneic, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F).
* Respiratory support: Oxygen via nasal cannula at 6 liters per minute.
* Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia, with a right atrial clot seen on echocardiogram.
* Neurological: Weak and soft voice, appears comfortable, alert, and oriented.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 cm, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 120/51 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: Total input of 2,453 mL, with a total output of 1,235 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,218 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count (WBC) of 20.2, with a differential of 87.9% neutrophils, 8.0% lymphocytes, and 3.8% monocytes.
	+ Electrolytes: Sodium of 141 mmol/L, potassium of 4.5 mmol/L, chloride of 97 mmol/L, and bicarbonate of 33 mmol/L.
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL and 1.8 mg/dL, respectively.
	+ Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL.
	+ Cardiac enzymes: CK of 1718 IU/L, with a CKMB of 11 IU/L.
* Imaging studies:
	+ Head CT: Showing a layering high density in the left occipital region, likely representing a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
	+ Chest CT: Negative for PE, but unable to assess the lower lungs.
	+ Echocardiogram: Showing mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal systolic function, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right atrial clot and a history of PE, and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a BUN and creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL and 1.8 mg/dL, respectively, and is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, and is at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is tachypneic and has a respiratory acidosis, and is at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of CVA and is at risk for further neurological deterioration.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue heparin gtt to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of microhemorrhage in the brain.
3. Monitor for signs of fluid overload and adjust IVFs as needed.
4. Trend creatinine and BUN to monitor for further renal deterioration.
5. Monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Consider formal neuro consult if scan shows progression.
7. Consider V/Q scan for possible definitive diagnosis of PE.
8. Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as needed.
10. Continue gentle hydration and electrolyte replacement as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with complaints of episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and a cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The patient has a right atrial clot and is receiving heparin therapy. She also has leukocytosis, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a high likelihood of PE, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial clot may indicate cardiac complications, such as right ventricular failure or atrial fibrillation.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and she is at risk for ARF due to her underlying medical conditions and medication use.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated CK levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could be a secondary complication of her cardiac and pulmonary conditions.
5. Seizure or Cerebral Infarct: The patient's elevated CK levels and possible microhemorrhages on CT head may indicate a seizure or cerebral infarct, which could have significant neurological consequences.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated TSH level may indicate hypothyroidism, which could contribute to her symptoms and laboratory abnormalities.
7. Viral Myositis or Inflammatory Myositis: The patient's elevated CK levels may indicate viral or inflammatory myositis, which could be a primary or secondary complication of her underlying medical conditions.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and possible left-sided infiltrate on CXR may indicate pneumonia, which could be a secondary complication of her cardiac and pulmonary conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin therapy to prevent further clot formation and progression of PE.
2. Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes in microhemorrhages.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac and pulmonary status closely, including EKG and ABG monitoring.
4. Consider a formal neurology consult if the patient's neurological symptoms worsen or if the CT head scan shows progression.
5. Trend the patient's creatinine levels and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider antibiotics if the patient's leukocytosis and elevated CK levels persist or worsen.
7. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
8. Consider a social work consult to discuss the patient's advance care planning and end-of-life care."

   - BCx/UCx
   - Head CT - layering high density in left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 758**], probably
   representing tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. No definite
   parenchymal or subdural hematoma.  Asymmetry of lateral ventricles with
   enlargement of right lateral ventricle likely chronic.  Extensive

   changes.  No evidence of acute large vascular territory infarction or
   shift of midline structures.  Could get MRI w/ diffusion weighted
   imaging
   - Chest CT - neg for PE (unable to assess lower lungs but no big
   embolus)
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] - Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
   systolic function. Right ventricular dilation, moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a probable mass in the right atrium. Discussed
   with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Lower ext u/s: No DVT in both lower extremities
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of

   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of DM, HTN, obesity, and prior CVA, presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes. She has undergone cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries, but significantly elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently stable, but with ongoing tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Despite a negative CT scan, the patient has a right atrial clot and ongoing dyspnea, which may indicate a PE.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocarditis or myopericarditis.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's ongoing tachypnea and metabolic alkalosis may indicate respiratory acidosis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including PE, cardiac complications, or primary pulmonary process.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could be related to pneumonia or another underlying condition.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and fractional excretion of urea may indicate acute renal failure, which could be related to dehydration, hypovolemia, or underlying kidney disease.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated CK and normal TSH may indicate hypothyroidism, which could be contributing to her ongoing weakness and fatigue.
7. Infection: The patient's ongoing fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could be related to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or another underlying condition.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Heparin gtt to treat the right atrial clot
2. Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of microhemorrhage in the brain
3. Oxygen as needed
4. Monitor on telemetry
5. Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
6. Pulmonary consult if the etiology of her dyspnea cannot be found
7. Gentle hydration to manage dehydration and hypovolemia
8. Renal dose medications to manage acute renal failure
9. Hold Lasix to manage acute renal failure

The patient's family has expressed a desire for comfort care and to avoid invasive procedures, and the patient's daughter has been identified as the HCP."

   - BCx/UCx
   - Head CT - layering high density in left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 758**], probably
   representing tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. No definite
   parenchymal or subdural hematoma.  Asymmetry of lateral ventricles with
   enlargement of right lateral ventricle likely chronic.  Extensive
   periventriculr white matter hypodensity [**2-14**] microangiopathic ischemic
   changes.  No evidence of acute large vascular territory infarction or
   shift of midline structures.  Could get MRI w/ diffusion weighted
   imaging
   - Chest CT - neg for PE (unable to assess lower lungs but no big
   embolus)
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] - Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
   systolic function. Right ventricular dilation, moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a probable mass in the right atrium. Discussed
   with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
   - Lower ext u/s: No DVT in both lower extremities
   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile
   - Urine cx/ua pending
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: although the cta was
negative
 for
   pulmonary embolus, the findings of a clot in the RA, a dilated
   hypocontractile RV, and a small (underfilled) hyperdynamic LV are
   almost pathognomonic for PE.  We will continue to treat with heparin
   given the RA mass.  We will check a followup echo tomorrow to make sure
   that anticoagulation is not worsening her small pericardial effusion.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.

   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: although the cta was
negative
 for
   pulmonary embolus, the findings of a clot in the RA, a dilated
   hypocontractile RV, and a small (underfilled) hyperdynamic LV are
   almost pathognomonic for PE.  We will continue to treat with heparin
   given the RA mass.  We will check a followup echo tomorrow to make sure
   that anticoagulation is not worsening her small pericardial effusion.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior CVA. She is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation of dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes. The patient has been experiencing episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes, which is concerning for pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the CT scan is negative for PE, and the patient has a right atrial clot on echocardiogram.

The patient has a significant leukocytosis on admission, with a count of 20K, and a history of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. She also has a history of CVA, which is stable, and is currently experiencing mild gait changes.

The patient has elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which are trending down, but the etiology is unknown. She also has a metabolic alkalosis, which is likely due to contraction alkalosis as the patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely related to Lasix at the rehab facility. She is currently on heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis and has a right atrial clot on echocardiogram.

The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns about her dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy and has requested that the patient avoid any invasive procedures and focus on comfort care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Despite the negative CT scan, the patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings suggest that PE is a possibility. Continued monitoring and treatment with heparin gtt are necessary.
2. Right atrial clot: The patient has a right atrial clot on echocardiogram, which is an abnormal presentation for clot development. This requires continued monitoring and treatment with heparin gtt.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis, but it requires further evaluation to rule out other causes.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to Lasix at the rehab facility, but it requires further evaluation and treatment.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires continued monitoring and treatment.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's dynamic EKG changes and tachycardia suggest that she may be at risk for cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and treatment with heparin gtt are necessary.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and treatment with oxygen as needed are necessary.
8. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and history of pneumonia suggest that she may be at risk for infection. Close monitoring and treatment with antibiotics as needed are necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to manage her dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms and to manage her underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on 4L oxygenating well
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed clean coronaries, but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is stable, but she is experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is uncertain, and the patient is being anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin. The patient also has leukocytosis, which may be related to a recent pneumonia or another underlying condition.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 20.2
* Hct: 35

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on 4L oxygenating well
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on 4L oxygenating well
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated

   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and was found to have a right atrial clot on echocardiogram. The patient is currently on heparin and coumadin therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/55 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 4L oxygen. Her respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination is notable for inspiratory crackles in the right mid-lower lobe, and her lungs are clear to auscultation in the left upper lobe. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and hypoactive bowel sounds are present. Her extremities are without edema or tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.2, which is elevated. Her troponin-T level is 0.02, and her creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated at 968 IU/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis is unclear, but the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered. The patient is being anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is pending. The patient's dyspnea may be due to PE, but other possibilities include pneumonia, myocarditis, or myopericarditis.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent CVA, and her daughter reports some mild gait changes and a weak voice. The patient's neurological examination is non-focal, and a CT head scan is pending to assess for interval changes.

The patient's metabolic alkalosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis, and her elevated CK level is of unknown etiology. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and her creatinine level is 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's plan of care includes anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin, and close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results. The patient will also receive IV fluids and oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's daughter has requested that the patient avoid invasive procedures and focus on comfort care, and a social work consult is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on 4L oxygenating well
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, an 85-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and a history of cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries but significantly elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of DM, HTN, obesity, and prior CVA.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm (94-107 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 123/55 mmHg (69-124/58-70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths/min (12-37 breaths/min)
* SpO2: 98%
* Oxygen delivery: 4 L via nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: NAD, weak/soft voice, appears comfortable, alert, and oriented
* HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL
* Neck: Supple with JVP of 13 cm
* Cardiac: Tachycardic, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Lungs: Inspiratory crackles in the right mid-lower lobe, difficult to auscultate the left lung due to body position and habitus
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, hypoactive bowel sounds
* Extremities: No edema, no bruit, no tenderness on palpation
* Skin: Warm, dry, no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Pulses: Radial 2+ DP, Doppler PT, and [**Name (NI) **]: Radial 2+ DP, 2+ PT

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 20.2, 21.2, 19.7
* Hct: 35, 40.2, 38.3
* Plt: [**Telephone/Fax (3) 9188**]
* Cr: 1.7, 1.7, 1.5
* TropT: 0.02, 0.02
* Glucose: 221, 176, 202
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.2/50.7/1.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 968/11/0.02, ALT/AST: 34/83, Alk Phos/T Bili: 102/0.6, Differential-Neuts: 87.9%, Lymph: 8.0%, Mono: 3.8%, Eos: 0.1%, Albumin: 2.3 g/dL, LDH: 271 IU/L, Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.7 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath, or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
* Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of possible left-sided infiltrate.
* Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2 weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but nothing specific.
* Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine.
* Elevated CK: Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
* Coronaries: Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report.
* Pump: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with normal contractility; patient with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE, but no lower extremity edema.
* Rhythm: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia.
* Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility. Fractional excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal.
* Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
* Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)
* Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
* Cardiac Arrest
* Sepsis
* Pneumonia
* Myocarditis or Myopericarditis
* Cerebral Infarct or Hemorrhage

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt
* Monitor for signs of fluid overload and hypovolemia
* Trend CK and TSH
* Perform a formal Neuro consult if CT head shows progression
* Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
* Consider pulmonary consult if unable to find etiology of dyspnea
* Start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
* Trend creatinine
* Renally dose meds
* Hold Lasix
* Monitor blood pressure
* Continue oxygen therapy
* Monitor for signs of infection and sepsis
* Consider gentle hydration and diuresis as needed."

   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.

   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro20).  Started
   on coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior CVA. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed clean coronaries, but significantly elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient is currently stable, but the assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms, including tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia, are inconsistent with PE, but the CT scan was not ideal quality, and the right atrial clot seen on echocardiogram suggests possible sub-segmental clots in the lungs.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of recent pneumonia. The CXR in the ED showed a possible left-sided infiltrate, and the patient received antibiotics, but the white count remains elevated.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a respiratory acidosis, and the metabolic alkalosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis, as the patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine.
4. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The patient's CK level is elevated, but the etiology is unknown. The CKMB is not elevated, so it is not cardiac in origin.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased, and the fractional excretion of urea suggests pre-renal failure.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal, but hypothyroidism is a possible etiology of the elevated CK.
7. Viral Myositis: Inflammatory myositis, infection, or medication-related etiologies are also possible causes of the elevated CK.
8. Cardiac Rhythm: The patient has some question of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outside hospital, but the EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia.
9. Hypertension: The patient is currently normotensive, but hypertension is a concern, given her history.

The plan is to continue heparin infusion until the INR is greater than 2.0, monitor the patient's oxygen saturation, and consider pulmonary, neurology, and nephrology consultations. The patient is also being started on coumadin, and her medications will be renally dosed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient, an 85-year-old female, is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for various medical conditions. The patient has a history of dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, and a recent CVA (cerebrovascular accident). She was admitted to the hospital with tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is attributed to possible sub-segmental clots in the lungs, which may not have been detected on the CT scan. The patient is being anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to a recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. The patient is being monitored for signs of infection.
3. Hx of CVA: The patient has a history of CVA, and her daughter reports some mild gait changes and weak voice.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a respiratory acidosis, which is likely due to contraction alkalosis as she appears dehydrated.
5. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated, which may be related to a seizure, cerebral infarct, hypothyroidism, viral myositis, inflammatory myositis, infection, or medication-related causes.
6. Coronaries: The patient has minimal coronary artery disease.
7. PUMP: The patient has normal left ventricular function and normal PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure).
8. RHYTHM: The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and there is some question of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
9. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and it is unknown whether this is related to Lasix administration at the rehab facility.

The patient is being treated with various medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and medications for hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. She is also receiving IV fluids and is being monitored for signs of fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has sub-segmental clots in the lungs, which may lead to PE.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and respiratory acidosis may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may worsen, leading to renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and respiratory acidosis may indicate an underlying infection.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac failure: The patient's elevated JVP (jugular venous pressure) and right atrial clot may indicate cardiac failure.

The patient's family has expressed a desire to avoid invasive procedures and focus on comfort care. The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy, and the patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate) status."

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile
   - Urine cx/ua pending
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Respiratory rate: 29 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Weak and soft voice
* Appears comfortable, alert, and oriented
* Sclera anicteric, PERRL
* Supple neck with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 13 cm
* Tachycardic with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Soft and non-tender abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds
* No signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 20.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 408 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 34 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium (Na): 144 mEq/L, potassium (K): 4.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl): 103 mEq/L, calcium (Ca): 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg): 2.7 mg/dL, phosphorus (PO4): 3.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 221 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is uncertain, but the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation, or primary pulmonary process (including pneumonia) is considered. The patient has a right atrial clot, which is an abnormal presentation for clot development.

The plan is to:

* Continue heparin infusion
* Transition to coumadin after head CT today
* Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of microhemorrhage in the brain
* Monitor on telemetry
* Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
* Consider pulmonary consult if the etiology of the patient's dyspnea is not found
* Benefit from PFTs to further assess lung function

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Acute kidney injury
* Metabolic alkalosis
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK)
* Hypertension
* Dehydration
* Infection
* Seizure or cerebral infarct
* Hypothyroidism
* Viral or inflammatory myositis
* Medication-related side effects

The patient's family history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The patient's medical history is significant for CVA, pneumonia, and cardiac catheterization. The patient's current medications include aspirin, heparin, and Lasix."

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro20).  Started
   on coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro20).  Started
   on coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function

   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to episodic dyspnea with dynamic electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, and was found to have significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications. The following potential complications are noted:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's clinical presentation, including tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia, is consistent with PE. However, the CT scan did not show a large main PA thrombus, and the patient's EKG changes may be due to other causes.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to a recent pneumonia or other inflammatory process.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's ABG results show a respiratory acidosis, which is inconsistent with PE. The patient's metabolic alkalosis may be due to contraction alkalosis, as she appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine.
4. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The patient's CK level is elevated, which may be due to a variety of causes, including seizure, cerebral infarct, hypothyroidism, viral myositis, inflammatory myositis, infection, or medication-related effects.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her fractional excretion of urea is 16.18, indicating pre-renal failure.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normal, but it may fluctuate and require close monitoring.
7. Cardiac Issues: The patient's EKG changes may be due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and her cardiac catheterization results showed minimal coronary artery disease.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin to prevent further clot formation.
2. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and EKG changes.
3. Treatment of the patient's metabolic alkalosis with gentle hydration.
4. Management of the patient's elevated CK level with further evaluation and treatment as needed.
5. Monitoring of the patient's renal function and treatment of ARF with IV fluids and renally adjusted medications.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and treatment of hypertension as needed.
7. Consideration of a pulmonary consult to further evaluate the patient's dyspnea and potential pulmonary processes.
8. Consideration of a neurology consult to further evaluate the patient's CVA and potential neurologic complications.
9. Close monitoring of the patient's overall condition and adjustment of treatment as needed."
