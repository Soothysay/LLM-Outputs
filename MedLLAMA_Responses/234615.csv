   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male diabetic, former smoker, with DM2, CAD, hyperlipidemia
   who presents from [**Hospital6 1986**] with likely large territory
   NSTEMI. Patient is s/p cardiac catherization at [**Hospital3 337**] which
   demonstrates diffuse 3 vessel disease being evaluated for CABG.
   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] eptifibatide, continue heparin gtt, continue ASA
   - Change simvastatin 40mg to atorvastatin 80mg
   - start beta blocker given HTN and significant coronary artery disease
   - Holding ACE-I given borderline blood pressure, but can consider
   low-dose of this in AM if blood pressure is stable.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from cardiothoracic surgery aware, and plan to review
   angiography films with team in AM
   - f/u surgery recs regarding plans
   - Trend biomarkers, ECG, telemetry
   # Respiratory failure - Likely CHF as below, treat with diuresis, will
   hold antibiotics as no clear infiltrate on chest x-ray. Patient febrile
   overnight to 100 with leukocytosis. On initial chest x-ray no clear
   infiltrate.
   -          f/u final read chest x-ray
   -          consider Levoquin for treatment of community acquired
   pneumonia if clinically suspect
   .
   # PUMP:  Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF, unclear
   whether he also has chronic component.  Elevated PCWP on cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Diuresis for I/O -500cc-1000cc as tolerated by blood pressure,
   furosemide 20mg IV PRN
   - cont aspirin, statin, plavix, beta blocker
   - Start ACE-I this morning is pressure tolerates
   - Repeat echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline
   - Holding ACE-I given blood pressure, consider restarting if BP stable
   and creatinine stable.
   - Obtain records from PCP if able
   - Monitor electrolytes, renally dose medications
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm.
   # Diabetes mellitus - holding metformin and giving insulin sliding
   scale while in house

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia, who was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath after a cardiac catheterization. The patient has a large territory non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF) and is likely experiencing an acute exacerbation. He is being treated with diuresis and is being monitored for signs of pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and his baseline kidney function is unclear. He is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances and is being treated with furosemide.
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is experiencing an acute systolic CHF.
4. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient has a large territory NSTEMI, and his cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse 3-vessel disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure: The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Progression of AKI: The patient's kidney function may continue to decline, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Development of arrhythmias: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute CHF may lead to the development of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse 3-vessel disease, which increases the risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's febrile state and leukocytosis increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and AKI increase the risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Diuresis for fluid overload and CHF.
2. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and eptifibatide.
3. Aspirin and statin therapy for acute coronary syndrome.
4. Beta blocker therapy for hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
6. Furosemide therapy for AKI.
7. Monitoring for signs of pneumonia and other infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male diabetic, former smoker, with DM2, CAD, hyperlipidemia
   who presents from [**Hospital6 1986**] with likely large territory
   NSTEMI. Patient is s/p cardiac catherization at [**Hospital3 337**] which
   demonstrates diffuse 3 vessel disease being evaluated for CABG.
   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] eptifibatide, continue heparin gtt, continue ASA
   - Change simvastatin 40mg to atorvastatin 80mg
   - start beta blocker given HTN and significant coronary artery disease
   - Holding ACE-I given borderline blood pressure, but can consider
   low-dose of this in AM if blood pressure is stable.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from cardiothoracic surgery aware, and plan to review
   angiography films with team in AM
   - f/u surgery recs regarding plans
   - Trend biomarkers, ECG, telemetry
   # Respiratory failure - Likely CHF as below, treat with diuresis, will
   hold antibiotics as no clear infiltrate on chest x-ray. Patient febrile
   overnight to 100 with leukocytosis. On initial chest x-ray no clear
   infiltrate.
   -          f/u final read chest x-ray

   whether he also has chronic component.  Elevated PCWP on cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Diuresis for I/O -500cc-1000cc as tolerated by blood pressure,
   furosemide 20mg IV PRN
   - cont aspirin, statin, plavix, beta blocker
   - Start ACE-I this morning is pressure tolerates
   - Repeat echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline
   - Holding ACE-I given blood pressure, consider restarting if BP stable
   and creatinine stable.
   - Obtain records from PCP if able

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia who was transferred to the ICU after cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, and has a history of cardiac catheterization with diffuse 3-vessel disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/63 mmHg. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PIP of 16 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak value of 2.18 ng/mL, and a lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. The patient's cardiac enzymes, such as CK and CKMB, are also elevated.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a repeat chest x-ray showing possible worsening fluid overload. The patient is being treated with diuresis and is being closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also concerning, with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF. The patient is being treated with diuresis and is being closely monitored for signs of cardiac decompensation.

The patient's renal status is also concerning, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22 mg/dL. The patient is being closely monitored for signs of acute renal failure.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin sliding scale, and the patient's glycemic control is being closely monitored.

The patient's antibiotic regimen includes heparin, eptifibatide, and ASA, and the patient is being closely monitored for signs of infection.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is currently CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and the patient may develop respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Cardiac decompensation: The patient's cardiovascular status is concerning, and the patient may develop cardiac decompensation if not treated promptly.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal status is concerning, and the patient may develop acute renal failure if not treated promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male diabetic, former smoker, CAD, hyperlipidemia who
   presents from [**Hospital6 1986**] with large territory NSTEMI. Patient
   is s/p cardiac catherization at [**Hospital3 337**] which demonstrates diffuse
   3 vessel disease, being evaluated for CABG.
   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.  Started on eptifibatide.
   - Cont. eptifibatide, heparin gtt, continue ASA
   - Cont. atorvastatin 80mg
   - start beta blocker given HTN and significant coronary artery disease
   - Consider low-dose ACE if blood pressure is stable, holding for now
   given BP borderline and trying to diurese.

   etiologies in differential as well given fever and leukocytosis
   (however this could also be [**3-19**] acute MI).  Treating with diuresis,
   holding off on antibiotics as no clear infiltrate on chest x-ray.
   Patient had some respiratory distress overnight, placed on NRB.  CXR
   showed worsening pulm. Edema. Received 40mg IV lasix with good UOP and
   breathing improved.  Resp. status also improved with HR control.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Decrease nitro gtt to give more room in BP for diuresis
   - Goal I/O -1-2L with prn lasix
   - consider Levaquin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia if
   clinically suspect

   # PUMP:  Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF, unclear
   whether he also has chronic component.  Elevated PCWP on cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Diuresis for I/O -1-2L as tolerated by blood pressure
   - cont aspirin, statin, beta blocker
   - Holding ACE-I
   - Repeat echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline. Cr stable at 1.4 today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes, former smoking, CAD, and hyperlipidemia who presented with large territory NSTEMI and was evaluated for CABG. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which demonstrated diffuse 3-vessel disease. He was started on eptifibatide, heparin, and aspirin, and was also prescribed atorvastatin and a beta blocker.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing increased work of respiration and was placed on non-rebreather oxygen therapy. His ABG shows a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 286, and PaCO2 of 39. His chest x-ray shows worsening pulmonary edema.
* Cardiac status: The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF. His cardiac catheterization showed elevated PCWP.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine is stable at 1.4 mg/dL, but his baseline renal function is unclear. He is being monitored for electrolyte imbalance and is receiving diuretic therapy.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 95/63 mmHg, and his heart rate is 85 bpm. His central venous pressure is 22 mmHg, and his pulmonary artery pressure is 201 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 22 mL of IV fluids and has a total fluid balance of -84 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving aerosol-cool oxygen therapy and is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is tenuous, and he is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and he is at risk for further deterioration, including respiratory arrest and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
* Renal complications: The patient's renal function is unclear, and he is at risk for further deterioration, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. He is at risk for sepsis and septic shock.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and to improve his chances of recovery."
