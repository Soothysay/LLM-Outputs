   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - EEG showed focal seizure activity, so neurology consulted.  They gave
   ativan with some correction of seizure activity and recommended
   dilantin loading prior to expected burr hole procedure.
   - 5pm dilantin level 17.7, which with albumin of 3.3 and low Cr
   clearance corrects to level of 41.2.  Will not give further dilantin
   tonight and reassess with neuro in AM.
   - Family gave consent to neurosurg for procedure, but were worried when
   anesthesia explained that he may be difficult to extubate.
   - Per nursing, has basically been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub
   since ativan and dilantin

   Imaging: [**11-14**] EEG pending
   [**11-13**] CT without contrast
   FINDINGS: There is a new large 2.5 cm fluid collection in a lentiform
   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.
   [**11-13**] CXR portable
   IMPRESSION: Unchanged retrocardiac opacification which likely
   represents
   atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying infectious
   process
   cannot be excluded.

 MALNUTRITION
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in pt with ESRD
   and elderly.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
   - If doesn
t wake up may need drugs dialyzed off?
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,
   however apparently they were hesitant after speaking anesthesia
   - F/u with family about whether they want to do the NSurg procedure
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg
   - Is NPO for procedure
   - Hold SubQ heparin
   - Given Dilantin load for seizures, will hold on further administration
   due to decreased responsiveness
   3. Seizure activity:
   - Was given ativan and dilantin and is now unresponsive
   - F/u with Neurology this am
   - Repeat EEG in context of unresponsiveness
   Low grade fevers: No clear signs of infection but with suspicious
   opacity on CXR
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Needs UA and UCx
   - Hold off on ABx for now
   -ESRD on hemodialysis: Received dialysis Saturday.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - renal consult in AM for dialysis in house
   Asthma: Stable.
   - continue Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
   Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive:  Per notes, patient has had a
   substantial decline recently and has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 226**] mental status.
   Currently unable to respond to questions.
   - continue mirtazapine
   - will need to discuss goals of care with family
   Hypertension:
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue simvastatin 10 mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive, presents with a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. He has been experiencing significant decline over the past couple of months. The patient has been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub since receiving Ativan and Dilantin. He has a history of allergies, including iodine, aspirin, NSAIDs, E-Mycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Levofloxacin. His current medications include captopril, simvastatin, mirtazapine, and Fluticasone. He has a code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of seizures due to the presence of a subdural hematoma and the patient's history of seizure activity.
2. Risk of further decline in mental status and potential development of delirium due to the patient's age, dementia, and recent decline.
3. Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a fluid collection.
4. Risk of bleeding due to the patient's history of ESRD and the presence of a subdural hematoma.
5. Risk of respiratory compromise due to the patient's age and potential development of pneumonia.
6. Risk of electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's history of ESRD and potential development of electrolyte disturbances.
7. Risk of further decline in nutritional status due to the patient's history of malnutrition and failure to thrive.
8. Risk of development of pressure ulcers due to the patient's immobility and potential decline in skin integrity.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and consider administering anticonvulsant medications as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider administering medications to manage delirium if necessary.
3. Consider repeating the CT scan to monitor the size and location of the fluid collection.
4. Consider administering antibiotics if the patient develops signs of infection.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's antihypertensive medications to manage blood pressure.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's antihyperlipidemic medications to manage cholesterol levels.
7. Consider administering medications to manage electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider providing enteral nutrition to support the patient's nutritional needs.
9. Consider providing pressure ulcer prevention measures to reduce the risk of development of pressure ulcers.
10. Consider discussing goals of care with the patient's family and obtaining their input on the patient's treatment plan."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a male with a history of dementia, subdural hemorrhage, and malnutrition. He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizure activity. The EEG showed focal seizure activity, and neurology consulted, recommending Ativan and loading with Dilantin prior to the expected burr hole procedure. The patient's dilantin level was 17.7, which corrected to 41.2 with albumin and low creatinine clearance. Further Dilantin was withheld for the night, and reassessment with neurology was planned for the morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/60 mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 93%. The patient's physical examination is limited due to his uncooperative behavior.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 220 K/uL. His creatinine clearance is 3.0 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 36 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L.

Imaging studies show a large 2.5 cm fluid collection in the lentiform region, which effaces the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The attenuation values suggest mostly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) density with some hemorrhagic elements.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased risk of seizure activity due to the patient's history of seizures and the presence of a fluid collection in the brain.
2. Complications related to the patient's malnutrition, such as decreased immune function and increased risk of infections.
3. Potential for further hemorrhage or worsening of the subdural hemorrhage.
4. Respiratory complications due to the patient's pneumonia and atelectasis.
5. Infection-related complications, such as sepsis or meningitis.
6. Neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or cerebral edema.
7. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Repeat CXR and CT scans to monitor the patient's condition.
2. Repeat UA and UCx to monitor for signs of infection.
3. Continue seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust as necessary.
5. Continue nutrition support and glycemic control measures.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - EEG showed focal seizure activity, so neurology consulted.  They gave
   ativan with some correction of seizure activity and recommended
   dilantin loading prior to expected burr hole procedure.
   - 5pm dilantin level 17.7, which with albumin of 3.3 and low Cr
   clearance corrects to level of 41.2.  Will not give further dilantin
   tonight and reassess with neuro in AM.
   - Family gave consent to neurosurg for procedure, but were worried when
   anesthesia explained that he may be difficult to extubate.
   - Per nursing, has basically been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub
   since ativan and dilantin

   FINDINGS: There is a new large 2.5 cm fluid collection in a lentiform
   [**Doctor Last Name 9874**]
   overlying the right frontoparietal area (series 105B, image 76) which
   effaces
   the sulci and causes mass effect with 8 mm of rightward shift. The
   attenuation is at the fluid level although more hyperattenuating
   strands are
   seen within this fluid collection consistent with blood. There is no
   loss of
   [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation. Ventricles on the right are of normal
   configuration. There is no depressed skull fracture. Visualized mastoid
   air
   cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are normal. The orbits
   appear
   normal.
   IMPRESSION: Lentiform left frontoparietal fluid collection measuring
   2.6 cm,
   new with mass effect. Attenuation values suggest mostly CSF densoty
   with some
   hemorrhagic elements. This may represent a subdural hygroma mostly
   containing
   CSF secondary to hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan: This is an 89 year old male with a history of
   dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis and recent admission for
   fevers and failure to thrive who presents from dialysis with a syncopal
   episode found to have a new left sided fluid collection on head CT.
   1. Unresponsiveness: Likely due to Ativan and Dilantin in pt with ESRD
   and elderly but concerning for worsening intracranial process.
   - No more sedating meds
   - Hold on Dilantin until f/u with Neurology this am
   - If doesn
t wake up may need drugs dialyzed off?
   - Get stat head CT this am to reassess worsening fluid collection in
   head and see if any herniation
   - Get repeat ABG this am
   2. Left sided intracranial fluid collection:  Unclear chronicity but pt
   has been having significant decline over past couple months. Family has
   been in discussion with neurosurgery re: burr hole and evacuation,
   however apparently they were hesitant after speaking anesthesia
   - F/u with family about whether they want to do the NSurg procedure
   - F/u with Neurology, NSurg
   - Is NPO for procedure
   - Hold SubQ heparin
   3. Seizure activity:
   - Was given ativan and dilantin and is now unresponsive
   - F/u with Neurology this am about med regimen for
   prophylaxis/treatment
   4. Low grade fevers: No clear signs of infection but with suspicious
   opacity on CXR
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Needs UA and UCx
   - Hold off on ABx for now
   -ESRD on hemodialysis: Received dialysis Saturday.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - renal consult in AM for dialysis in house
   Asthma: Stable.
   - continue Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
   Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive:  Per notes, patient has had a

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presents with a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT, which is likely a subdural hygroma containing CSF and hemorrhagic elements. The patient has been unresponsive to voice or sternal rub since receiving Ativan and Dilantin, and his vital signs are stable. He has a history of malnutrition, dementia, and failure to thrive.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Intracranial hypertension:** The patient's left-sided fluid collection may cause mass effect and potentially lead to intracranial hypertension, which can result in increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. **Seizure activity:** The patient's recent seizure activity may indicate a worsening of his underlying condition, and further evaluation by neurology is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. **Infection:** The patient's low-grade fevers and suspicious opacity on CXR may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out with further diagnostic testing, such as UA and UCx.
4. **Deterioration of neurological status:** The patient's unresponsiveness to voice or sternal rub may indicate a worsening of his neurological status, which requires close monitoring and potential adjustment of his medication regimen.
5. **Hemodialysis complications:** The patient's ESRD on hemodialysis may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or electrolyte imbalances, which need to be closely monitored and managed.
6. **Nutritional deficiencies:** The patient's history of malnutrition and failure to thrive may lead to further complications, such as decreased immune function, wound healing difficulties, and increased risk of infections.
7. **Cognitive decline:** The patient's dementia and recent decline may lead to further cognitive decline, which requires close monitoring and potential adjustment of his medication regimen.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
2. Obtain further diagnostic testing, such as UA and UCx, to rule out infection.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's hemodialysis schedule to ensure optimal management of his ESRD.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide adequate nutrition to prevent further malnutrition and failure to thrive.
5. Consider consulting with a neurologist to determine the best course of treatment for the patient's seizure activity.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cognitive status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent further cognitive decline."

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old man with a subdural hematoma (SDH) and midline shift, who is currently in the ICU. He has declined in mental status and worsened encephalopathy, temporally associated with anti-epileptic medication. He has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/65 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 93%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. He is being treated with antibiotics and anti-epileptic medication.

Potential medical complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's SDH and midline shift may lead to increased intracranial pressure, which can cause further decline in mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may recur, and the anti-epileptic medication may need to be adjusted or additional medications added to control seizures.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ESRD make him susceptible to infection, which can be life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, particularly if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's ESRD and potential sepsis may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or hypertension.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ESRD and potential stress ulcer prophylaxis may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's encephalopathy and potential worsening of his neurological status may lead to further decline in his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, including his mental status, seizure activity, and respiratory status.
2. Continue to treat the patient's SDH with surgical drainage and anti-epileptic medication.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including his white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotics and anti-epileptic medication based on his laboratory results and clinical status.
5. Continue to provide stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider adding additional prophylactic measures to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, including his blood pressure and heart rate.
7. Consider adding additional medications to prevent or treat potential complications, such as antibiotics for infection or medications to control seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, ESRD on hemodialysis, and recent admission for fevers and failure to thrive. He presented with a syncopal episode and was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. He is currently unresponsive, has a left-sided intracranial fluid collection, and is experiencing seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening intracranial process: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to worsening intracranial process, which could lead to herniation and brainstem compression.
2. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and suspicious opacity on CXR may indicate an underlying infection, which could spread to other parts of the body.
3. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity may lead to further brain damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may exacerbate his underlying conditions and increase the risk of complications.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia may worsen due to his underlying conditions, leading to further decline in his cognitive and physical function.
6. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may worsen due to his underlying conditions, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to his underlying conditions, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hold on Dilantin until further discussion with Neurology.
2. Get stat head CT to reassess worsening fluid collection in the head and rule out herniation.
3. Repeat ABG to monitor the patient's respiratory status.
4. F/u with family about whether they want to do the neurosurgery procedure.
5. F/u with Neurology and NSurg about the patient's seizure activity and medication regimen.
6. Repeat CXR to monitor for signs of infection.
7. Hold off on antibiotics for now and repeat UA and UCx.
8. Continue dialysis and consult with renal specialist for in-house dialysis.
9. Continue asthma medication and discuss goals of care with family.
10. Continue hypertensive medication and discuss hyperlipidemia with the patient's wife.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his underlying conditions to prevent further complications and improve his clinical outcome."

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male with a history of dementia, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, tachypnea, and a left-sided intracranial fluid collection. He was admitted with a syncopal episode and was found to have a new left-sided fluid collection on head CT. The fluid collection was drained in the OR yesterday. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the past couple of months.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Intracranial Process: The patient's unresponsiveness may be due to medications or a worsening intracranial process, which is concerning. A stat head CT during the day today is planned to assess for worsening.
2. Stridor: The patient's tachypnea may be due to stridor, which is concerning. A CXR for a new process, bedside bronchoscopy to assess for a cause of stridor, and talking to neurosurgery about a possible central source are planned.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient is currently not following commands but does not appear to be seizing. A follow-up phenytoin level is planned to decide on further doses.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and dialysis is planned in the ICU today. Holding off on treating hyperkalemia until then is planned.
5. Dementia/Malnutrition/Failure to Thrive: The patient's dementia, malnutrition, and failure to thrive are ongoing concerns. Continuing mirtazapine and discussing goals of care with the family are planned.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with captopril 6.25 mg TID.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with simvastatin 10 mg daily.
8. ESRD on Hemodialysis: The patient's ESRD on hemodialysis is ongoing, and dialysis is planned in the ICU today.
